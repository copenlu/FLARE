Generate an explanation, analysis and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task. The 3 sections should be exactly outlined.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer and use the provided Relation Transitions.
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.

### Explanation

In the given context, Scott and Lewis are brothers, and Jason is the father of their father. The question asks for the relationship between Lewis and Jason.

1. **Scott and Lewis are brothers**: This means they share the same parents.
2. **Jason is the father of their father**: This implies Jason is the grandfather of both Scott and Lewis.

Based on the provided Relation Transitions, we can determine that the father's father is the grandfather.

### Analysis

To find out how Lewis is related to Jason, we need to trace the relationships:

1. **Scott and Lewis's Father**: Let's denote him as [Father].
2. **Jason is the father of [Father]**: Thus, Jason is the grandfather of Lewis (and Scott).

Using the transitions provided:

- **selfs father is father**: [Father] is Lewis's father.
- **fathers father is grandfather**: Jason is Lewis's grandfather.

Therefore, Lewis is the grandson of Jason.

### Plan to Generate a Prompt for SWI-Prolog Code

1. **Define Relationships**: Establish predicates to define familial relationships such as father, mother, brother, sister, etc.
2. **Base Facts**: Provide the base facts for the given context (e.g., Scott and Lewis are brothers, Jason is the father of their father).
3. **Inference Rules**: Create rules to infer indirect relationships using the provided transitions (e.g., if X is the father of Y and Y is the father of Z, then X is the grandfather of Z).
4. **Query**: Formulate a query to determine the relationship between Lewis and Jason.

### Constructing the Plan for the Code Prompt

1. **Define the Facts**:
   - `father(jason, father).`
   - `father(father, scott).`
   - `father(father, lewis).`

2. **Define the Rules**:
   - A rule to establish brother relationship:
     ```prolog
     brother(X, Y) :- father(Z, X), father(Z, Y), X \= Y.
     ```
   - A rule to establish grandfather relationship:
     ```prolog
     grandfather(X, Y) :- father(X, Z), father(Z, Y).
     ```

3. **Query**:
   - To find the relationship between Lewis and Jason:
     ```prolog
     ?- grandfather(jason, lewis).
     ```

### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt

```prolog
% Define the facts
father(jason, father).
father(father, scott).
father(father, lewis).

% Define the rules
brother(X, Y) :- father(Z, X), father(Z, Y), X \= Y.
grandfather(X, Y) :- father(X, Z), father(Z, Y).

% Query to determine the relationship
% To find out how Lewis is related to Jason
?- grandfather(jason, lewis).
```

### Logic

1. **Facts**: Establish who is the father of whom.
2. **Brother Rule**: Use the common father to define brother relationships.
3. **Grandfather Rule**: Use the chain of father relationships to define the grandfather relationship.
4. **Query**: Check if Jason is the grandfather of Lewis by traversing the relationships. 

This plan ensures a step-by-step approach to determine the relationship between Lewis and Jason using Prolog's inference capabilities and the given Relation Transitions.


[Example 2]

Context: [Jason] always had some great adventure planned for his granddaughter [Guillermina] when she came to visit. So, naturally, when [Myrna] told her daughter [Guillermina] that they would be going to visit [Jason] she could hardly contain herself.
Question: How is [Jason] related to [Myrna]?

### Explanation

In this scenario, we have three individuals: Jason, Guillermina, and Myrna. The relationships are as follows:
- Jason has planned adventures for his granddaughter Guillermina.
- Myrna told her daughter Guillermina about visiting Jason.

From these relationships, we can deduce that:
- Guillermina is the daughter of Myrna.
- Jason is the grandfather of Guillermina.

Therefore, Jason is the father of Myrna. Thus, Myrna is related to Jason as his daughter.

### Analysis

To analyze the relationship between Myrna and Jason, let's break down the family tree:
1. Guillermina is the daughter of Myrna.
2. Jason is the grandfather of Guillermina, which means Jason is one generation above Myrna.

In other words, Jason is the parent of Myrna, making Myrna the daughter of Jason.

### Plan to Generate a Prompt for Writing a SWI-Prolog Code

#### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Define the relationships in Prolog:**
   - Identify the individuals involved: Jason, Guillermina, and Myrna.
   - Define the parent-child relationships between them.

2. **Construct the parent relationships:**
   - Use facts to represent that Jason is the parent of Myrna.
   - Use facts to represent that Myrna is the parent of Guillermina.

3. **Define a rule to determine grandparent relationships:**
   - Create a rule that defines a grandparent relationship based on parent relationships.

4. **Query the relationship:**
   - Formulate a query to find out how Myrna is related to Jason using the parent rule.
