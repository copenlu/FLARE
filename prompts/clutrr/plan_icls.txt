[Example 1]

Context: [Jason] always had some great adventure planned for his granddaughter [Guillermina] when she came to visit. So, naturally, when [Myrna] told her daughter [Guillermina] that they would be going to visit [Jason] she could hardly contain herself.
Question: How is [Jason] related to [Myrna]?

Generate an explanation, analysis and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer and use the provided Relation Transitions.
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.

##Explanation Analysis Plan

1. How is [Jason] related to [Guillermina]? (independent, support: "[Jason] always had some great adventure planned for his granddaughter [Guillermina] when she came to visit.")
relation(Jason, Guillermina) = grandfather
2. How is [Guillermina] related to [Myrna]? (independent, support: "So, naturally, when [Myrna] told her daughter [Guillermina] that they would be going to visit [Jason] she could hardly contain herself.")
relation(Guillermina, Myrna) = daughter
3. Final answer: How is [Jason] related to [Myrna]? (depends on 1, 2)
relation(Jason, Myrna) = relation(Jason, Guillermina) @ relation(Guillermina, Myrna)

[Example 2]

Context: [Gabrielle] drove her daughter [Dorothy] to the hospital. [Dorothy]'s son [Vincent] showed up shortly after.
Question: How is [Vincent] related to [Gabrielle]?

Generate an explanation, analysis and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer and use the provided Relation Transitions.
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.

##Explanation Analysis Plan

1. How is [Vincent] related to [Dorothy]? (independent, support: "[Dorothy]'s son [Vincent] showed up shortly after.")
relation(Vincent, Dorothy) = son
2. How is [Dorothy] related to [Gabrielle]? (independent, support: "[Gabrielle] drove her daughter [Dorothy] to the hospital.")
relation(Dorothy, Gabrielle) = daughter
3. Final answer: How is [Vincent] related to [Gabrielle]? (depends on 1, 2)
relation(Vincent, Gabrielle) = relation(Vincent, Dorothy) @ relation(Dorothy, Gabrielle)
