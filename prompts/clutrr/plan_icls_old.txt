[Example 1]

Context: [Scott] and [Lewis] are brothers. [Jason] is father of their father.
Question: How is [Lewis] related to [Jason]?

Generate an explanation, analysis and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task. The 3 sections should be exactly outlined.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer and use the provided Relation Transitions.
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.

### Explanation

In this scenario, we have three individuals: Scott, Lewis, and Jason. The relationships are as follows:
- Scott and Lewis are brothers.
- Jason is the father of Scott and Lewis's father.

From these relationships, we can deduce that:
- Scott and Lewis share the same father.
- Jason is the grandfather of both Scott and Lewis because he is the father of their father.

Thus, Lewis is the grandson of Jason.

### Analysis

To analyze the relationship between Lewis and Jason, let's break down the family tree:
1. Scott and Lewis are brothers, which means they share the same father.
2. Jason is the father of Scott and Lewis's father. Therefore, Jason is the paternal grandfather of Scott and Lewis.

In other words, Jason is one generation above Scott and Lewis's father, making Jason the grandfather of both Scott and Lewis. Therefore, Lewis is related to Jason as his grandson.

### Plan to Generate a Prompt for Writing a SWI-Prolog Code

#### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Define the relationships in Prolog:**
   - Identify the individuals involved: Scott, Lewis, and Jason.
   - Define the parent-child relationships between them.

2. **Construct the parent relationships:**
   - Use facts to represent that Jason is the parent of Scott and Lewis's father.
   - Use facts to represent that Scott and Lewis's father is the parent of both Scott and Lewis.

3. **Define a rule to determine grandparent relationships:**
   - Create a rule that defines a grandparent relationship based on parent relationships.

4. **Query the relationship:**
   - Formulate a query to find out how Lewis is related to Jason using the grandparent rule.

[Example 2]

Context: [Jason] always had some great adventure planned for his granddaughter [Guillermina] when she came to visit. So, naturally, when [Myrna] told her daughter [Guillermina] that they would be going to visit [Jason] she could hardly contain herself.
Question: How is [Jason] related to [Myrna]?



### Explanation

In this scenario, we have four individuals: Jason, Myrna, Guillermina, and the daughter of Myrna. The relationships are as follows:
- Guillermina is the granddaughter of Jason.
- Myrna is Guillermina's mother.

From these relationships, we can deduce that:
- Jason is the grandfather of Guillermina.
- Myrna is the daughter of Jason since Myrna's daughter (Guillermina) is Jason's granddaughter.

Thus, Jason is related to Myrna as her father.

### Analysis

To analyze the relationship between Jason and Myrna, let's break down the family tree:
1. Jason is the grandfather of Guillermina.
2. Guillermina is the daughter of Myrna.

This implies:
- Since Jason is Guillermina's grandfather and Myrna is Guillermina's mother, Jason must be Myrna's father.

Therefore, Myrna is related to Jason as his daughter.

#### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Define the relationships in Prolog:**
   - Identify the individuals involved: Jason, Myrna, and Guillermina.
   - Define the parent-child and grandparent-grandchild relationships between them.

2. **Construct the parent and grandparent relationships:**
   - Use facts to represent that Jason is the parent of Myrna.
   - Use facts to represent that Myrna is the parent of Guillermina.

3. **Define a rule to determine grandparent relationships:**
   - Create a rule that defines a grandparent relationship based on parent relationships.

4. **Query the relationship:**
   - Formulate a query to find out how Jason is related to Myrna using the parent rule.
