Generate an explanation, analysis and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task. The 3 sections should be exactly outlined.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer and use the provided Relation Transitions.
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.

##################

Write a Prolog code to solve using the plan. If there are unknown or stochastic atoms or predicates, fill in the values for them as a logical assumption and add an comment in the same line "% Assumed atom/predicate".
Do not use write and read commands within the code. The code should be very detailed and utilize swi prolog capibilites to the fullest.

To run the program, at the end create a predicate named "query" that returns the correct answer.
It is very important that the last line of the program should be the commented-out driver predicate "query". Write only the code.

The code should be enclosed in ``` ```.

Ignoring the read commands, explcilty write out the search paths that are explored by the code:

Here are the paths [Starting Search Simulation]:

Given the plan, the code and the explored search paths answer the question above with the correct relation.
