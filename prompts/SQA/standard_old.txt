Generate an explanation, Analysis, and plan to generate prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task. 
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer. 
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt,
actively use swi prolog search capibilites.

##################

Write a Prolog code to solve using the plan. If there are unknown or stochastic atoms or predicates, fill in the values for them as a logical assumption and add an inline comment "% Assumed atom/predicate".
Do not use write and read commands within the code.

To run the program, at the end create a predicate named "query" with the inputs and arguments required for getting all the answers. 
It is very important that the last line of the program should be the commented-out driver predicate "query". Write only the code.

The code should be enclosed in ``` ```.

Ignoring the write and read commands, explcilty write out the search paths that explored in the code:

Here are the paths [Starting Search Simulation]:

Given the plan, the code and the explored search paths answer the question above. Answer with a yes or no.
