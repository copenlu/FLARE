Generate a very short explanation, analysis, a plan for logically answering the question.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer. 
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. 

##################

Write a Prolog code to solve using the plan. If there are unknown or stochastic atoms or predicates, fill in the values for them as a logical assumption and add an comment in the same line "% Assumed atom/predicate".
Do not use write and read commands within the code. The code should be very detailed and utilize swi prolog capibilites to the fullest.

To run the program, at the end create a predicate named "query" that does not take any arguments and return only true or false. 
It is very important that the last line of the program should be the commented-out driver predicate "query". Write only the code.

The code should be enclosed in ``` ```.

##################

Ignoring the read commands, explcilty write out the search paths that are explored by the code:

Here are the paths [Starting Search Simulation]:

Given the plan, the code and the explored search paths answer the question above. Answer with a yes or no.
