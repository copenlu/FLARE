[Example 1]

Question: Yesterday was April 30, 2021. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?

Generate an explanation, analysis and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task. The 3 sections should be exactly outlined.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer. 
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.

**Explanation:**

The task is to calculate the date for tomorrow given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. If yesterday was April 30, 2021, then today is May 1, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be May 2, 2021, which can be represented as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.

**Analysis:**

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between dates, especially the transition between months. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is the first day of the following month, May. Calculating the date involves basic arithmetic and understanding the month-day boundaries.

In Prolog, this can be implemented by writing rules that recognize month boundaries and correctly calculate the next date. Prolog’s backtracking and pattern-matching capabilities will help us handle these rules efficiently.

**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**

1. **Define Date Representation:**
   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.
   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations.

2. **Base Case:**
   - Write a base case for the last day of a month transitioning to the next month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 30, the next date should change the month to May (`MM` becomes 5) and set the day to 1.

3. **Normal Case:**
   - Write a rule for regular day increment where the day (`DD`) simply increases by 1 if it is not the last day of the month.

4. **Leap Year Consideration:**
   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February dates.

5. **Recursive Logic:**
   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, taking into account month-end and year-end transitions.

6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**
   - Use Prolog’s built-in search to handle pattern matching and rule application, ensuring the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.

7. **Test Cases:**
   - Include test cases for the transition of months (e.g., April 30, 2021 to May 1, 2021) and years (e.g., December 31, 2021, to January 1, 2022).

The code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that handles these transitions and can output the date of "tomorrow" based on the given input.

[Example 2]

Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Generate an explanation, analysis and plan to generate a prompt for writing a swi-prolog code for the last task. The 3 sections should be exactly outlined.
Your plan should show enough intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer.
Construct the plan as much as you can and describe the logic specifically. When constructing the plan for the code prompt, actively use swi prolog search capabilities.

**Explanation:**

The task requires determining today's date, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. Since December has only 31 days, today cannot be December 32, 1929. Therefore, the correct date today is January 1, 1930, represented as 01/01/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.

**Analysis:**

To solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one year to the next, which occurs after December 31. The key is to recognize that the date rolls over to January 1 of the following year. This requires understanding both month-day boundaries and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to correctly identify when the transition to a new month and year should occur.

**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**

1. **Define Date Representation:**
   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.
   - Ensure that the structure can manage both day and month increments as well as year transitions.

2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**
   - Write a base case that handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should change the month to January (`MM` becomes 1), the day to 1, and increment the year (`YYYY` increases by 1).

3. **Normal Case:**
   - Write a rule that simply increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month and handles month transitions correctly.

4. **Month-End Transitions:**
   - Implement logic to handle transitions between different months, recognizing that different months have different numbers of days (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days, etc.).

5. **Leap Year Consideration:**
   - Include logic to determine if the year is a leap year to correctly handle February dates.

6. **Recursive Logic:**
   - Implement recursive rules to handle day, month, and year transitions, making sure that the correct logic is applied depending on the date structure.

7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**
   - Leverage Prolog’s built-in search to correctly apply rules and pattern matching, ensuring the correct date is selected when moving from one day to the next.

8. **Test Cases:**
   - Include test cases to verify the correct transition from December 31 to January 1 across different years, including both non-leap and leap years.

The code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately determines the date "today" based on the input, handling both regular and boundary cases like year transitions.
