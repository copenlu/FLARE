        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem is to determine the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using a format of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. Additionally, we need to determine how many of the letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Analyzing the Bike Number Format:\n- **Format**: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n- **Letters**: Assuming the use of the English alphabet, there are 26 possible letters.\n- **Numbers**: Each number can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values per number position.\n\n#### Calculation of Total Combinations:\n1. **Letter Combinations**: \n   - If both letters need to be distinct, the number of combinations for the first letter is 26, and for the second letter, it is 25 (since it cannot be the same as the first).\n   - Total distinct letter combinations = \\( 26 \\times 25 \\).\n\n2. **Number Combinations**:\n   - Each of the two number positions can be any of 10 digits (0-9).\n   - Total number combinations = \\( 10 \\times 10 \\).\n\n3. **Total Bike Numbers**:\n   - Total combinations = (Total distinct letter combinations) \u00d7 (Total number combinations).\n   - Total combinations = \\( (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 10) = 65000 \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 65,000, assuming both letters need to be distinct.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using the specified format and checks how many letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of letters (26) and the range of numbers (0-9).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations for Letters**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 distinct letters from the 26 available.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Numbers**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 numbers where each number can be from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two predicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the generation of combinations and ensure distinctness where required.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n   - Confirm the requirement for the letters to be distinct by checking the calculated total against the expected result (65000).\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and confirm the conditions regarding the distinctness of letters. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in handling combinatorial logic and arithmetic operations.",
