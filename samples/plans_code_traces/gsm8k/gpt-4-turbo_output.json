The task is to calculate the total cost of the meal and then determine how much each friend must pay if the bill is split equally among them. The items ordered include a Taco Salad, Dave's Single hamburgers, sets of french fries, and cups of peach lemonade, each with specific costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much each friend pays, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each item:\n   - Taco Salad: $10\n   - Dave's Single hamburgers: 5 orders at $5 each = $25\n   - French fries: 4 sets at $2.50 each = $10\n   - Peach lemonade: 5 cups at $2 each = $10\n\n2. Sum up these costs to get the total bill:\n   - Total bill = $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (Hamburgers) + $10 (Fries) + $10 (Lemonade) = $55\n\n3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend pays:\n   - Each friend pays = Total bill / 5\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_bill\" that takes variables for each item's cost and the number of friends.\n2. Assign constants to the costs of individual items (e.g., cost of Taco Salad, cost of a hamburger).\n3. Compute the total cost for each type of item by multiplying the unit cost with the quantity ordered.\n4. Sum up all these total costs to get the final bill.\n5. Divide the final bill by the number of friends to determine how much each friend pays.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define costs of items\nitem_cost(taco_salad, 10).\nitem_cost(hamburger, 5).\nitem_cost(fries, 2.5).\nitem_cost(lemonade, 2).\n\n% Calculate total cost of an item type\ntotal_item_cost(Item, Quantity, TotalCost) :-\n    item_cost(Item, CostPerItem),\n    TotalCost is CostPerItem * Quantity.\n\n% Calculate the total bill and how much each friend pays\ncalculate_bill(NumFriends, EachPays) :-\n    total_item_cost(taco_salad, 1, TotalTacoSalad),\n    total_item_cost(hamburger, 5, TotalHamburgers),\n    total_item_cost(fries, 4, TotalFries),\n    total_item_cost(lemonade, 5, TotalLemonade),\n    TotalBill is TotalTacoSalad + TotalHamburgers + TotalFries + TotalLemonade,\n    EachPays is TotalBill / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost of each item, calculates the total cost for each type of item based on the quantity, sums these to get the total bill, and finally computes the amount each friend pays by dividing the total bill by the number of friends."

The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints.",

Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1.

Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem.

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on similar items.

Calculate Sara's total expenditure by adding the cost of the shoes and the dress.\n2. Double Sara's expenditure to determine Rachel's budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of Rachel's budget based on the expenses of Sara. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent)` which calculates the total amount spent by Sara.

Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget. This rule will take the total spent by Sara as input and output the budget for Rachel by doubling Sara's expenditure.\n\n3.

Calculate the total number of toys collected from friends: 18 (stuffed animals) + 42 (action figures) + 2 (board games) + 13 (puzzles) = 75 toys.\n2.

We know the number of hours each person worked and the total widgets produced. By determining the contributions of Sam and Jack, we can isolate Tony's contribution and calculate his assembly rate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate:\n1. The number of widgets Sam alone could assemble in his working hours.\n2. The number of widgets Sam and Jack together could assemble in the hours they worked together.\n3. Subtract these contributions from the total to find out how many widgets Tony assembled.\n4. Use the time Tony worked to calculate his rate of assembling widgets.\n\nSteps:\n1. Convert Sam's working hours into minutes and calculate the widgets he could assemble alone.\n2. Convert the time Sam and Jack worked together into minutes and calculate the widgets they assembled together.\n3. Subtract the sum of widgets from step 1 and 2 from the total widgets to find the widgets Tony assembled.\n4. Divide Tony's working time by the number of widgets he assembled to find the time per widget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code can leverage its logical and arithmetic capabilities to solve this problem efficiently.\n\n1. Define a predicate `widget_assembly(SamHours, JackHours, TonyHours, TotalWidgets, TonyRate)` where:\n   - `SamHours`, `JackHours`, and `TonyHours` are the hours each worked.\n   - `TotalWidgets` is the number of widgets assembled.\n   - `TonyRate` will be calculated as the output.\n\n2. Calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled alone:\n   - Convert Sam's hours to minutes: `SamMinutes is SamHours * 60`.\n   - Calculate widgets: `SamWidgets is SamMinutes / 10`.\n\n3. Calculate the number of widgets Sam and Jack assembled together:\n   - Determine the overlapping hours they both worked, which is the minimum of Sam's and Jack's hours.\n   - Convert this time to minutes: `OverlapMinutes is min(SamHours, JackHours) * 60`.\n   - Calculate widgets from overlap: `JointWidgets is (OverlapMinutes / 15) * 2`.\n\n4. Calculate Tony's contribution:\n   - Total widgets from Sam and joint effort: `SamTotalWidgets is SamWidgets + JointWidgets`.\n   - Widgets Tony assembled: `TonyWidgets is TotalWidgets - SamTotalWidgets`.\n\n5. Determine Tony's rate:\n   - Convert Tony's hours to minutes: `TonyMinutes is TonyHours * 60`.\n   - Calculate Tony's rate: `TonyRate is TonyMinutes / TonyWidgets`.\n\n6. Use Prolog's arithmetic and logical inference to solve for `TonyRate` when the predicate `widget_assembly` is queried with actual values.\n\nThis plan leverages arithmetic operations within Prolog to compute values based on the relationships and constraints given, and it effectively isolates the variable (Tony's rate) that we need to solve for."

Calculate Tony's contribution:\n   - Total widgets from Sam and joint effort: `SamTotalWidgets is SamWidgets + JointWidgets`.\n   - Widgets Tony assembled: `TonyWidgets is TotalWidgets - SamTotalWidgets`.\n\n5. Determine Tony's rate:\n   - Convert Tony's hours to minutes: `TonyMinutes is TonyHours * 60`.\n   - Calculate Tony's rate: `TonyRate is TonyMinutes / TonyWidgets`.\n\n6. Use Prolog's arithmetic and logical inference to solve for `TonyRate` when the predicate `widget_assembly` is queried with actual values.\n\nThis plan leverages arithmetic operations within Prolog to compute values based on the relationships and constraints given, and it effectively isolates the variable (Tony's rate) that we need to solve for.",

To determine the total time taken to complete all these activities, we need to sum up the time spent on each activity. These activities include getting in shape, learning mountain climbing, climbing the seven summits, learning diving, and diving through caves.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Getting in shape: 2 years.\n2. Learning mountain climbing: Twice the time taken to get in shape, i.e., 2 * 2 = 4 years.\n3. Climbing the seven summits: Each summit takes 5 months to climb, so for seven summits, 7 * 5 = 35 months. Since 12 months make a year, this is equivalent to 35 / 12 \u2248 2.92 years.\n4. Learning to dive: 13 months, which is 13 / 12 \u2248 1.08 years.\n5. Diving through caves: 2 years.\n\nTo find the total time spent, we need to sum all these durations.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total time taken based on the given durations for each activity. Prolog's arithmetic capabilities will be used to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nThe blueprint to create a SWI-Prolog code for this scenario is as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_time` that takes variables for each activity duration and calculates the total time.\n2. Convert months to years where necessary to maintain consistency in units.\n3. Sum up the durations to get the total time.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n1. Define a predicate `convert_months_to_years(Months, Years)` that converts months to years.\n2. Define a predicate `total_bucket_list_duration(GettingInShape, LearningClimbing, ClimbingSummits, LearningDiving, DivingCaves, TotalYears)` where:\n   - `GettingInShape` is 2 (years),\n   - `LearningClimbing` is 4 (years),\n   - `ClimbingSummits` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `LearningDiving` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `DivingCaves` is 2 (years),\n   - `TotalYears` is the sum of all the above durations.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`) to perform the calculations and Prolog's logical inference to ensure the correct flow of data.\n\nThis structured approach leverages Prolog's capabilities to solve the problem through logical inference and arithmetic calculations, providing a clear and concise solution."

Getting in shape: 2 years.\n2. Learning mountain climbing: Twice the time taken to get in shape, i.e., 2 * 2 = 4 years.\n3. Climbing the seven summits: Each summit takes 5 months to climb, so for seven summits, 7 * 5 = 35 months. Since 12 months make a year, this is equivalent to 35 / 12 \u2248 2.92 years.\n4. Learning to dive: 13 months, which is 13 / 12 \u2248 1.08 years.\n5. Diving through caves: 2 years.\n\nTo find the total time spent, we need to sum all these durations.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total time taken based on the given durations for each activity. Prolog's arithmetic capabilities will be used to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nThe blueprint to create a SWI-Prolog code for this scenario is as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_time` that takes variables for each activity duration and calculates the total time.\n2. Convert months to years where necessary to maintain consistency in units.\n3. Sum up the durations to get the total time.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n1. Define a predicate `convert_months_to_years(Months, Years)` that converts months to years.\n2. Define a predicate `total_bucket_list_duration(GettingInShape, LearningClimbing, ClimbingSummits, LearningDiving, DivingCaves, TotalYears)` where:\n   - `GettingInShape` is 2 (years),\n   - `LearningClimbing` is 4 (years),\n   - `ClimbingSummits` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `LearningDiving` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `DivingCaves` is 2 (years),\n   - `TotalYears` is the sum of all the above durations.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`) to perform the calculations and Prolog's logical inference to ensure the correct flow of data.\n\nThis structured approach leverages Prolog's capabilities to solve the problem through logical inference and arithmetic calculations, providing a clear and concise solution.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem requires calculating the total monthly costs for two different living scenarios based on rent, utilities, and transportation costs to work. The goal is to find out the difference in total costs between the two options after considering all these factors.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the first apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($800) and monthly utilities ($260).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost as the product of daily miles driven (31 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the first apartment.\n\n2. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the second apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($900) and monthly utilities ($200).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost using the daily miles driven (21 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the second apartment.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between the two total costs** to determine which apartment allows for greater monthly savings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate each part of the problem and then compare the results.\n\n1. **Define a predicate for calculating transportation cost**:\n   - Parameters: Miles per day, Cost per mile, Days per month.\n   - Returns: Total transportation cost.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for calculating total monthly cost**:\n   - Parameters: Rent, Utilities, Transportation cost.\n   - Returns: Total monthly cost.\n\n3. **Define a predicate to calculate the difference between the two total monthly costs**:\n   - Parameters: Total cost for the first apartment, Total cost for the second apartment.\n   - Returns: Difference in total costs.\n\n4. **Implement the predicates with actual values**:\n   - Use 800 for rent and 260 for utilities for the first apartment.\n   - Use 900 for rent and 200 for utilities for the second apartment.\n   - Use 31 miles and 21 miles for the daily transportation distances for the first and second apartments respectively.\n   - Use 58 cents as the cost per mile and 20 as the number of workdays per month.\n\n5. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference** to compute the results based on the given data.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code this way, we can efficiently compute the required values and compare the costs of the two apartments. This will allow the man to make an informed decision based on the computed cost difference.",
