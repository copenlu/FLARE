This relationship is derived by understanding the lineage from Jason to Guillermina and then connecting Myrna as the intermediate link (mother of Guillermina).\n\n## Plan for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n### Objective:\n- Write a SWI-Prolog code that can determine the relationship between two individuals based on given family relationships.\n\n### Steps to Construct the Prolog Code:\n\n1. **Define Family Relationships**:\n   - Use Prolog facts to define direct relationships like `parent(X, Y)` which means X is a parent of Y.\n\n2. **Define Rules for Extended Relationships**:\n   - Define rules for `grandparent(X, Y)` which can be derived if there exists a `Z` such that `parent(X, Z)` and `parent(Z, Y)`.\n   - Define rules for determining if someone is a father or a mother specifically, using gender if necessary.\n\n3. **Querying the Relationship**:\n   - Use the defined rules to query the relationship, such as asking if Jason is Myrna's father based on the established relationships.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline:\n\n```prolog\n% Facts\nparent(jason, myrna).\nparent(myrna, guillermina).\n\n% Rules\ngrandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).\nfather(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), male(X).\n\n% Query\n?- father(jason, myrna).\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n- **Facts**: Define direct parent-child relationships.\n- **Rules**: \n  - `grandparent(X, Y)` checks if X is a grandparent of Y by finding an intermediate Z.\n  - `father(X, Y)` checks if X is the father of Y, assuming a fact `male(X)` exists.\n- **Query**: The query checks if Jason is the father of Myrna using the defined rules and facts.\n\nThis plan leverages SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define relationships and query them based on logical rules, providing a structured way to deduce family relationships from given facts."

This relationship is derived by understanding the lineage from Jason to Guillermina and then connecting Myrna as the intermediate link (mother of Guillermina).\n\n## Plan for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n### Objective:\n- Write a SWI-Prolog code that can determine the relationship between two individuals based on given family relationships.\n\n### Steps to Construct the Prolog Code:\n\n1. **Define Family Relationships**:\n   - Use Prolog facts to define direct relationships like `parent(X, Y)` which means X is a parent of Y.\n\n2. **Define Rules for Extended Relationships**:\n   - Define rules for `grandparent(X, Y)` which can be derived if there exists a `Z` such that `parent(X, Z)` and `parent(Z, Y)`.\n   - Define rules for determining if someone is a father or a mother specifically, using gender if necessary.\n\n3. **Querying the Relationship**:\n   - Use the defined rules to query the relationship, such as asking if Jason is Myrna's father based on the established relationships.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline:\n\n```prolog\n% Facts\nparent(jason, myrna).\nparent(myrna, guillermina).\n\n% Rules\ngrandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).\nfather(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), male(X).\n\n% Query\n?- father(jason, myrna).\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n- **Facts**: Define direct parent-child relationships.\n- **Rules**: \n  - `grandparent(X, Y)` checks if X is a grandparent of Y by finding an intermediate Z.\n  - `father(X, Y)` checks if X is the father of Y, assuming a fact `male(X)` exists.\n- **Query**: The query checks if Jason is the father of Myrna using the defined rules and facts.\n\nThis plan leverages SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define relationships and query them based on logical rules, providing a structured way to deduce family relationships from given facts."

This relationship is derived by understanding the lineage from Jason to Guillermina and then connecting Myrna as the intermediate link (mother of Guillermina).\n\n## Plan for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n### Objective:\n- Write a SWI-Prolog code that can determine the relationship between two individuals based on given family relationships.\n\n### Steps to Construct the Prolog Code:\n\n1. **Define Family Relationships**:\n   - Use Prolog facts to define direct relationships like `parent(X, Y)` which means X is a parent of Y.\n\n2. **Define Rules for Extended Relationships**:\n   - Define rules for `grandparent(X, Y)` which can be derived if there exists a `Z` such that `parent(X, Z)` and `parent(Z, Y)`.\n   - Define rules for determining if someone is a father or a mother specifically, using gender if necessary.\n\n3. **Querying the Relationship**:\n   - Use the defined rules to query the relationship, such as asking if Jason is Myrna's father based on the established relationships.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline:\n\n```prolog\n% Facts\nparent(jason, myrna).\nparent(myrna, guillermina).\n\n% Rules\ngrandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).\nfather(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), male(X).\n\n% Query\n?- father(jason, myrna).\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n- **Facts**: Define direct parent-child relationships.\n- **Rules**: \n  - `grandparent(X, Y)` checks if X is a grandparent of Y by finding an intermediate Z.\n  - `father(X, Y)` checks if X is the father of Y, assuming a fact `male(X)` exists.\n- **Query**: The query checks if Jason is the father of Myrna using the defined rules and facts.\n\nThis plan leverages SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define relationships and query them based on logical rules, providing a structured way to deduce family relationships from given facts.",
