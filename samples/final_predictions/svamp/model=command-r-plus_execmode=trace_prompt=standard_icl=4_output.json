Initially, there were 9 computers. Each day, from Monday to Thursday, 5 more computers were added. The goal is to determine the total count of computers by the end of Thursday.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Start with the known number of computers, which is 9.\n2. **Daily Installation**: Each day, 5 computers are added.\n3. **Number of Days**: Computers were added for 4 consecutive days (Monday to Thursday).\n4. **Total Computers Added**: Multiply the number of computers added daily by the number of days (4 days).\n5. **Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to get the final number of computers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the final number of computers based on the initial count, the number of days, and the number of computers added each day. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_computers` that accepts four parameters: `InitialComputers`, `Days`, `ComputersPerDay`, and `FinalComputers`.\n2. **Calculate Total Added**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of computers added over the days as the product of `Days` and `ComputersPerDay`.\n3. **Calculate Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to derive the final count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the final number of computers by providing the initial conditions (initial count, number of days, and computers added per day).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of computers in the server room\ntotal_computers(InitialComputers, Days, ComputersPerDay, FinalComputers) :-\n    TotalAdded is Days * ComputersPerDay,\n    FinalComputers is InitialComputers + TotalAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of computers now in the server room\n% Given initial computers as 9, days as 4, and computers installed per day as 5\n?- total_computers(9, 4, 5, FinalComputers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

        "question": "Paco had 41 cookies. He gave 9 cookies to his friend and ate 18 cookies. How many more cookies did he eat than those he gave to his friend?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compare the number of cookies Paco ate with the number of cookies he gave to his friend and find the difference between these two quantities. Initially, Paco had 41 cookies. He gave 9 cookies to his friend, which leaves us with the number of cookies eaten. We then need to determine if he ate more cookies than he gave away or not.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of cookies: 41 cookies.\n2. Paco gave 9 cookies to his friend, so we subtract this quantity from the initial count: \\( 41 - 9 \\).\n3. Paco ate 18 cookies. We want to find out if this number is greater than the number of cookies he gave away.\n4. To determine if he ate more cookies, we compare the number of cookies eaten (18) with the number of cookies given (9).\n5. The difference between the number of cookies eaten and the number given will give us the answer to how many more cookies he ate.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of cookies eaten and the number given away. We'll structure the code as follows:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `cookies_difference` that accepts five parameters: `InitialCookies`, `GivenAway`, `EatenCookies`, `Difference`, and a flag `MoreAte` indicating if Paco ate more cookies.\n2. **Calculate Cookies Eaten**: Within the rule, calculate the number of cookies eaten by subtracting the given away count from the initial count.\n3. **Compare and Set Flag**: Compare the number of cookies eaten with the number given away. If `EatenCookies` is greater, set `MoreAte` to `true`; otherwise, set it to `false`.\n4. **Calculate Difference**: Find the difference between the cookies eaten and the cookies given away.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog to find out the difference and whether Paco ate more cookies by providing the initial conditions.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference and compare cookie counts\ncookies_difference(InitialCookies, GivenAway, EatenCookies, Difference, MoreAte) :-\n    EatenCookies is InitialCookies - GivenAway,\n    (EatenCookies > GivenAway -> MoreAte = true ; MoreAte = false),\n    Difference is EatenCookies - GivenAway.\n\n% Example query to find out the difference and if Paco ate more cookies\n% Given initial cookies as 41, gave away 9, and ate 18 cookies\n?- cookies_difference(41, 9, 18, Difference, MoreAte).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and calculations needed to determine the difference in cookie counts and whether Paco ate more cookies.

Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `water_depth` that takes parameters for Ron's height (`RonsHeight`), the difference between Dean's and Ron's heights (`HeightDifference`), and the depth multiplier (`DepthMultiplier`).\n2. **Calculate Dean's Height**: Inside the rule, calculate Dean's height by adding `RonsHeight` and `HeightDifference`.\n3. **Compute Water Depth**: Multiply Dean's height by `DepthMultiplier` to find the water depth.\n4. **Query in Prolog**: Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find the water depth by providing values for Ron's height, the height difference, and the depth multiplier.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the depth of the water\nwater_depth(RonsHeight, HeightDifference, DepthMultiplier, WaterDepth) :-\n    DeansHeight is RonsHeight + HeightDifference,\n    WaterDepth is DeansHeight * DepthMultiplier.\n\n% Example query to find out the depth of the water\n% Given Ron's height as 13 feet, Dean is taller than Ron by 4 feet, and depth multiplier as 15\n?- water_depth(13, 4, 15, WaterDepth).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the water depth.

        "question": "Baker made 121 cakes. He sold 105 of them and bought 170 new cakes. How many cakes does baker still have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTo find out how many cakes Baker still has, we need to calculate the net gain or loss of cakes. Initially, Baker made 121 cakes. He then sold some cakes, and we need to determine how many cakes were sold. Afterward, Baker bought 170 new cakes. To find the final count, we add the initial number of cakes to the number of new cakes and then subtract the number of cakes sold.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of cakes made: 121 cakes.\n2. Identify the number of new cakes bought: 170 cakes.\n3. Calculate the unknown number of cakes sold. This can be derived by subtracting the initial count from the sum of the initial count and new cakes: \\( (121 + 170) - \\text{sold cakes} \\).\n4. Compute the final count by adding the initial count and the number of new cakes, and then subtract the number of cakes sold: \\( 121 + 170 - \\text{sold cakes} \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that encapsulates the relationship between the initial cakes made, the new cakes bought, the cakes sold, and the final count. Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `cakes_remaining` that accepts five parameters: `InitialCakes`, `SoldCakes`, `NewCakes`, `FinalCakes`, and `RemainingCakes`.\n2. **Calculate Total Cakes**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of cakes by adding `InitialCakes` and `NewCakes`.\n3. **Compute Remaining Cakes**: Determine the remaining cakes by subtracting `SoldCakes` from the total cakes derived in the previous step.\n4. **Query in Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying mechanism to find out the remaining number of cakes by providing values for the initial cakes made, new cakes bought, and assuming a variable for the sold cakes.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of cakes Baker still has\ncakes_remaining(InitialCakes, SoldCakes, NewCakes, FinalCakes, RemainingCakes) :-\n    TotalCakes is InitialCakes + NewCakes,\n    RemainingCakes is TotalCakes - SoldCakes.\n\n% Example query to find out how many cakes Baker still has\n% Given initial cakes made as 121, new cakes bought as 170, and we want to find out the sold cakes\n?- cakes_remaining(121, SoldCakes, 170, FinalCakes, RemainingCakes).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the various cake counts.

Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. We need to find out how many emails \"some more in the evening\" refers to, given that he received a total of 10 emails during the day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform simple arithmetic calculations:\n\n1.

Calculate the total number of emails Jack received in the morning and afternoon: 6 + 3 = 9 emails.\n4.

The problem is to determine how many action figures Jerry added to the shelf during this process.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many action figures Jerry added, we need to consider the initial and final states of his collection:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Jerry had 7 action figures.\n2. **Final State**: After adding some and removing 10, he now has 8 action figures.\n3. **Calculation**: To find the number of action figures added, we can subtract the initial count from the final count of action figures.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of action figures added based on the initial and final counts, taking into account the removal of 10 old action figures. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `added_action_figures`**: This rule will take four parameters - `InitialFigures`, `FinalFigures`, `RemovedFigures`, and `AddedFigures`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**: \n    - Calculate the net change in action figures by subtracting `InitialFigures` from `FinalFigures`.\n    - Ensure that the removal of old action figures is considered by subtracting `RemovedFigures` from the net change.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out how many action figures Jerry added, given the initial count, final count, and the number of old figures he removed.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of action figures added\nadded_action_figures(InitialFigures, FinalFigures, RemovedFigures, AddedFigures) :-\n    NetChange is FinalFigures - InitialFigures,\n    AddedFigures is NetChange - RemovedFigures.\n\n% Example query to find out how many action figures Jerry added\n% Given initial figures as 7, final figures as 8, and removed figures as 10\n?- added_action_figures(7, 8, 10, AddedFigures).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial and final states, taking into account the removal of old action figures.

        "question": "A waiter had 12 customers. After some left he still had 14 customers. Then he got 10 new customers, how many customers does he have now?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total number of customers a waiter has after some customers leave and then new customers arrive. Initially, the waiter had 12 customers. Some customers left, and the waiter still had 14 customers. Then, 10 new customers arrived. To find out the total number of customers the waiter has now, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial number of customers**: The waiter started with 12 customers.\n2. **Customers left**: Some customers left, but the text doesn't specify how many. We need to calculate this. We know that after some left, the waiter still had 14 customers.\n3. **Calculation of customers who left**: To find out how many customers left, we subtract the number of customers the waiter still had (14) from the initial count (12). This gives us a negative value, indicating that the waiter gained customers, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, we interpret this as no customers leaving.\n4. **New customers**: 10 new customers arrived.\n5. **Final calculation**: To find the total number of customers now, we add the initial count (12) and the new customers (10).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the final number of customers based on the initial count and the number of new customers, considering that no customers left. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define a rule `total_customers`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialCustomers`, `NewCustomers`, and `FinalCustomers`.\n2. **Arithmetic operations**: \n    - Calculate the number of customers who left by subtracting `InitialCustomers` from `NewCustomers`.\n    - Set the number of customers who left to 0 if the calculation results in a negative value.\n    - Calculate the `FinalCustomers` by adding the `InitialCustomers` and the `NewCustomers`.\n3. **Query using SWI-Prolog**: Write a query to find out the final number of customers the waiter has now, providing the initial count and the number of new customers.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of customers\ntotal_customers(InitialCustomers, NewCustomers, FinalCustomers) :-\n    CustomersLeft is NewCustomers - InitialCustomers,\n    (CustomersLeft < 0 -> CustomersLeft = 0),\n    FinalCustomers is InitialCustomers + NewCustomers.\n\n% Example query to find out how many customers the waiter has now\n% Given initial customers as 12 and new customers as 10\n?- total_customers(12, 10, FinalCustomers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial and new customer counts, handles the case of customers leaving, and computes the final number of customers.

Calculate the net change in customers: subtract the number of customers who left from the number of new customers (\\( 14 - 15 \\)).\n5. Add the net change to the initial number of customers to find the final count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the final number of customers the waiter has based on the initial count, the number of customers who left, and the number of new customers. Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `remaining_customers`**: This rule will accept four parameters - `InitialCustomers`, `LeftCustomers`, `NewCustomers`, and `FinalCustomers`.\n2. **Calculate Net Change**: Inside the rule, compute the net change in customers by subtracting `LeftCustomers` from `NewCustomers`.\n3. **Final Count**: Determine the final number of customers by adding the net change to the initial count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the final number of customers the waiter has by providing the initial count and the changes.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of customers the waiter still has\nremaining_customers(InitialCustomers, LeftCustomers, NewCustomers, FinalCustomers) :-\n    NetChange is NewCustomers - LeftCustomers,\n    FinalCustomers is InitialCustomers + NetChange.\n\n% Example query to find out how many customers the waiter still has\n% Given initial customers as 12, customers who left as 15, and new customers as 14\n?- remaining_customers(12, 15, 14, FinalCustomers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial state and the changes, computing the final number of customers the waiter has.

We need to account for this overlap to avoid double-counting.\n4. **Calculation**: To find the total number of students suggesting bacon, we add the two categories of students and then subtract the overlap (students suggesting both) to avoid double-counting.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo tackle this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define rules to represent the relationships between the categories of students and their suggestions. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define Rules**:\n   - `suggest_both(X)` - Represents students who suggested both mashed potatoes and bacon (218 students).\n   - `suggest_bacon_only(X)` - Represents students who suggested adding only bacon (351 students).\n   - `total_bacon_suggestions(X)` - Represents the total number of students suggesting bacon, accounting for overlap.\n2. **Relationships and Arithmetic**:\n   - The number of students suggesting both can be directly assigned as 218.\n   - The number of students suggesting only bacon can be directly assigned as 351.\n   - To find the total bacon suggestions, we add the counts from the two categories and then subtract the overlap (students suggesting both) to avoid double-counting.\n3. **Query**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of students suggesting bacon.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rules\nsuggest_both(218).\nsuggest_bacon_only(351).\n\n% Rule to calculate the total number of bacon suggestions\ntotal_bacon_suggestions(X) :-\n    suggest_both(A),\n    suggest_bacon_only(B),\n    X is A + B.\n\n% Query to find the total number of students suggesting bacon\n?- total_bacon_suggestions(TotalBaconSuggestions).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the total number of students suggesting bacon.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves comparing the number of marbles Ed and Doug have, even after Ed loses some of his marbles. Initially, Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Ed then lost 17 of his marbles at the playground. To find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug after this loss, we need to subtract Ed's lost marbles from his initial advantage in marbles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Comparison**: Ed started with 29 more marbles than Doug.\n2. **Loss of Marbles**: Ed lost 17 of his marbles.\n3. **Updated Comparison**: To determine how many more marbles Ed has than Doug now, we subtract the lost marbles from Ed's initial advantage.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug, taking into account Ed's initial advantage and the number of marbles he lost. Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `marbles_comparison` that accepts four parameters: `InitialAdvantage`, `LostMarbles`, `EdMarbles`, and `DougMarbles`.\n2. **Calculate Ed's Marbles**: Inside the rule, calculate the number of marbles Ed has now by subtracting the `LostMarbles` from his initial advantage (`InitialAdvantage`).\n3. **Calculate Doug's Marbles**: Doug's number of marbles is not explicitly given, but it is understood that he has less than Ed.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug after losing some of his marbles. Provide the initial advantage and the number of lost marbles.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate and compare the number of marbles Ed and Doug have\nmarbles_comparison(InitialAdvantage, LostMarbles, EdMarbles, DougMarbles) :-\n    EdMarbles is InitialAdvantage - LostMarbles,\n    DougMarbles < EdMarbles.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug\n% Given initial advantage as 29 and lost marbles as 17\n?- marbles_comparison(29, 17, EdMarbles, DougMarbles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between Ed's and Doug's marble counts, considering Ed's initial advantage and his loss of marbles.

        "question": "Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies. How many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves comparing the number of salty cookies Paco ate to the number of sweet cookies he ate to find out how many more salty cookies he consumed. Initially, Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. After eating some, he had 15 sweet cookies left and 28 salty cookies left. We need to calculate the difference in the number of salty and sweet cookies consumed to determine how many more salty cookies Paco ate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of sweet cookies: 40 cookies.\n2. Identify the initial number of salty cookies: 25 cookies.\n3. Determine the number of sweet cookies Paco ate: Initial sweet cookies - remaining sweet cookies = 40 - 15 = 25.\n4. Determine the number of salty cookies Paco ate: Initial salty cookies - remaining salty cookies = 25 - 28. Note that the result is negative, indicating he ate fewer salty cookies than sweet cookies.\n5. To find out how many more salty cookies he ate, we need to calculate the absolute difference between the number of sweet cookies eaten and the number of salty cookies eaten.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the difference in the number of cookies eaten, taking into account the initial and remaining quantities of both sweet and salty cookies. Here's a plan for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `cookie_difference` that accepts the initial and remaining counts for both sweet and salty cookies.\n2. **Calculate Cookies Eaten**: Inside the rule, compute the number of sweet cookies eaten and the number of salty cookies eaten.\n3. **Find Difference**: Calculate the absolute difference between the number of sweet cookies eaten and salty cookies eaten to determine how many more salty cookies were consumed.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the difference in the number of salty and sweet cookies eaten by providing the initial and remaining counts for both types of cookies.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in eaten cookies\ncookie_difference(InitSweet, RemSweet, InitSalty, RemSalty) :-\n    SweetEaten is InitSweet - RemSweet,\n    SaltyEaten is InitSalty - RemSalty,\n    Difference is abs(SweetEaten - SaltyEaten).\n\n% Example query to find out how many more salty cookies Paco ate\n% Given initial and remaining counts for sweet and salty cookies\n?- cookie_difference(40, 15, 25, 28, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the difference in the number of salty and sweet cookies eaten, taking into account the initial and remaining quantities.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_nails` that accepts four parameters: `LargePlanks`, `NailsPerPlank`, `AdditionalNails`, and `TotalNails`.\n2. **Calculate Nails for Large Planks**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of nails needed for large planks by multiplying `LargePlanks` by `NailsPerPlank`.\n3. **Calculate Total Nails**: Add the nails required for large planks to the `AdditionalNails` to derive the `TotalNails`.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the total number of nails required by providing the number of large planks, nails per plank, and additional nails needed.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of nails John needs for the house wall\ntotal_nails(LargePlanks, NailsPerPlank, AdditionalNails, TotalNails) :-\n    TotalLargeNails is LargePlanks * NailsPerPlank,\n    TotalNails is TotalLargeNails + AdditionalNails.\n\n% Example query to find out how many nails John needs\n% Given large planks as 13, nails per plank as 17, and additional nails as 8\n?- total_nails(13, 17, 8, TotalNails).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

Compute the revenue from the Texas Tech game by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold during that game by the profit made per t-shirt.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that encapsulates the relationship between the profit per t-shirt, the number of t-shirts sold at each game, and the revenue generated. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Create a rule named `texas_tech_revenue` that accepts five parameters: `ProfitPerShirt`, `TotalShirtsSold`, `ArkansasShirtsSold`, `TexasTechShirtsSold`, and `Revenue`.\n2. Calculate the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game by subtracting `ArkansasShirtsSold` from `TotalShirtsSold`.\n3. Compute the `Revenue` by multiplying the `TexasTechShirtsSold` by the `ProfitPerShirt`.\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the `Revenue` from the Texas Tech game, given the profit per shirt, total shirts sold, and shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate revenue from the Texas Tech game\ntexas_tech_revenue(ProfitPerShirt, TotalShirtsSold, ArkansasShirtsSold, Revenue) :-\n    TexasTechShirtsSold is TotalShirtsSold - ArkansasShirtsSold,\n    Revenue is TexasTechShirtsSold * ProfitPerShirt.\n\n% Example query to find out the revenue from the Texas Tech game\n% Given profit per shirt as 78, total shirts sold as 186, and Arkansas shirts sold as 172\n?- texas_tech_revenue(78, 186, 172, Revenue).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the variables and computes the revenue generated from the Texas Tech game.

We need to find out how many ripe apples the tree had before Rachel picked 2 ripe apples. This involves understanding the change in the number of ripe apples from the initial state to the current state.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the current state: There are 7 apples on the tree, and 6 of them are ripe.\n2. Understand the change: Rachel picked 2 ripe apples, which means there were more ripe apples initially.\n3. Determine the initial state: Calculate the number of ripe apples the tree had before Rachel picked any.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will involve defining rules to represent the relationships between the number of apples on the tree, the number of ripe apples, and the actions taken by Rachel. Here's a plan for the code:\n\n1. Define a rule `initial_ripe_apples` with three variables: `TotalInitialApples`, `InitialRipeApples`, and `RipeApplesPicked`.\n2. Express the relationship that the total initial apples are the sum of initial ripe apples and initial unripe apples.\n3. Represent the action taken by Rachel: She picked `RipeApplesPicked` from the initial ripe apples.\n4. Calculate the total number of ripe apples remaining on the tree after Rachel's action.\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine how many cookies each guest received given the number of cookies prepared and the number of guests who attended. Brenda's mother made 18 cookies expecting 10 guests, but only 1 guest showed up. To find out how many cookies each guest received, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of guests who actually attended.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of cookies prepared: 18 cookies.\n2. Identify the number of expected guests: 10 guests.\n3. Determine the number of guests who actually attended: 1 guest (as 9 guests did not come).\n4. Calculate the number of cookies each guest received by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of guests who attended.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the total number of cookies, the expected number of guests, the actual number of guests, and the number of cookies each guest received. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `cookies_per_guest` that takes five variables: `TotalCookies`, `ExpectedGuests`, `ActualGuests`, `CookiesEach`, and `RemainingCookies`.\n2. Calculate the number of cookies each guest received by dividing `TotalCookies` by `ActualGuests`.\n3. The remaining cookies can be calculated by subtracting (`CookiesEach` * `ActualGuests`) from `TotalCookies`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `CookiesEach` given the total number of cookies and the number of guests who attended.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of cookies each guest received\ncookies_per_guest(TotalCookies, ExpectedGuests, ActualGuests, CookiesEach, RemainingCookies) :-\n    CookiesEach is TotalCookies // ActualGuests,\n    CookiesGiven is CookiesEach * ActualGuests,\n    RemainingCookies is TotalCookies - CookiesGiven.\n\n% Example query to find out how many cookies each guest received\n% Given total cookies as 18, expected guests as 10, and actual guests as 1\n?- cookies_per_guest(18, 10, 1, CookiesEach, RemainingCookies).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the number of cookies each guest received, as well as the number of remaining cookies.

        "question": "After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over a period of 57 days, given the number of visitors on two specific days. Initially, we are told that there were 188 visitors the previous day, and 557 visitors came on a particular day. To find the total number of visitors over 57 days, we need to consider the average number of visitors per day and then multiply it by the total number of days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of visitors on the previous day: 188 visitors.\n2. Identify the number of visitors on a particular day: 557 visitors.\n3. Calculate the total number of visitors on these two days: 188 + 557 = 745 visitors.\n4. Find the average number of visitors per day over the two days: 745 visitors / 2 days = 372.5 visitors per day.\n5. To determine the total number of visitors over 57 days, multiply the average daily visitors by the total number of days: 372.5 * 57.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo create SWI-Prolog code for this problem, we can define rules to calculate the average daily visitors and then the total visitors over the given period.

        "question": "Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 4 peaches. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about the number of peaches that Jake, Steven, and Jill have, and we need to determine how many more peaches Jill has compared to Jake. To solve this, we first need to understand the relationships between their respective numbers of peaches. Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, and Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. Given that Steven has 4 peaches, we can deduce the number of peaches for Jill and Jake and then calculate the difference.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, so if Steven has 4 peaches, Jill has \\( 4 - 11 \\) peaches.\n2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has \\( 4 - 12 \\) peaches.\n3. To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we can calculate the difference between Jill's peaches and Jake's peaches.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define rules that represent the relationships between the number of peaches each person has. We will then use these rules to calculate the final counts for Jill and Jake before finding the difference. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define rules**:\n   - `steven_peaches`: Represents that Steven has 11 more peaches than someone.\n   - `jake_peaches`: Represents that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than someone.\n2. **Calculate intermediate counts**:\n   - Use the rule `steven_peaches` with Steven's count of 4 to find Jill's count.\n   - Use the rule `jake_peaches` with Steven's count of 4 to find Jake's count.\n3. **Calculate the difference**:\n   - Define a rule `more_peaches` to calculate how many more peaches one person has compared to another.\n4. **Query using Prolog**:\n   - Write a query to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake using the defined rules.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for Steven's peaches\nsteven_peaches(Steven, Jill) :-\n    Steven is Jill + 11.\n\n% Define the rule for Jake's peaches\njake_peaches(Steven, Jake) :-\n    Steven is Jake + 12.\n\n% Define the rule to calculate how many more peaches one person has\nmore_peaches(Person1, Person2, Count) :-\n    Person1Peaches is Count more than Person2Peaches.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake\n% Given that Steven has 4 peaches\n?- steven_peaches(4, Jill),\n   jake_peaches(4, Jake),\n   more_peaches(Jill, Jake, Count).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and performs the necessary calculations to find out how many more peaches Jill has compared to Jake, given the information about Steven's peaches.

We know that she played with a total of 18 kids over a period of two days: Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, she played with 4 kids. To find out how many kids she played with on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Monday from the total.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Total Number of Kids**: Julia played tag with a total of 18 kids.\n2. **Monday's Count**: She played with 4 kids on Monday.\n3. **Tuesday's Count**: The number of kids she played with on Tuesday is the difference between the total and Monday's count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday based on the total count and Monday's count. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `tuesday_count`**: This rule will take three arguments - `TotalKids`, `MondayKids`, and `TuesdayKids`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Calculate `TuesdayKids` by subtracting `MondayKids` from `TotalKids`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday given the total count and Monday's count.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday\ntuesday_count(TotalKids, MondayKids, TuesdayKids) :-\n    TuesdayKids is TotalKids - MondayKids.\n\n% Example query to find out how many kids Julia played with on Tuesday\n% Given a total of 18 kids and 4 kids on Monday\n?- tuesday_count(18, 4, TuesdayKids).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the total count of kids and Monday's count, and it computes the number of kids for Tuesday's play.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `animals_not_hiding` that accepts four parameters: `TotalAnimals`, `HidingSnakes`, `HidingAlligators`, and `NotHidingAnimals`.\n2. **Calculate Total Hiding Animals**: Inside the rule, calculate the sum of `HidingSnakes` and `HidingAlligators` to find the total number of hiding animals.\n3. **Calculate Animals Not Hiding**: Subtract the total hiding animals from the `TotalAnimals` to derive the count of animals not hiding.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the number of animals not hiding by providing the total count and the numbers of hiding snakes and alligators.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of animals not hiding\nanimals_not_hiding(TotalAnimals, HidingSnakes, HidingAlligators, NotHidingAnimals) :-\n    TotalHiding is HidingSnakes + HidingAlligators,\n    NotHidingAnimals is TotalAnimals - TotalHiding.\n\n% Example query to find out how many animals were not hiding\n% Given total animals as 79, hiding snakes as 24, and hiding alligators as 51\n?- animals_not_hiding(79, 24, 51, NotHidingAnimals).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the given data and the number of animals not hiding.

We know that Steven has 16 peaches. The goal is to find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jill.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the relationships between the number of peaches each person has:\n\n1. **Steven's Peaches**: Steven has 16 peaches.\n2. **Jake's Peaches**: Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has \\( 16 - 9 \\) peaches.\n3. **Jill's Peaches**: Jill's number of peaches is unknown, but we know that Jake has 18 more peaches than she does.\n4. **Comparison**: To find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jill, we need to compare their respective counts.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo approach this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define rules that represent the relationships between the number of peaches each person has.

Now, she wants to know how the amounts of sugar and salt compare, specifically how many more cups of sugar she needs to add compared to salt.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Quantities**: Start by recognizing the initial quantities specified in the recipe: 6 cups of flour, 8 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt.\n2. **Update Flour Quantity**: Mary has already used 5 cups of flour, so we subtract this amount from the initial flour requirement (6 cups).\n3. **Compare Sugar and Salt**: Calculate the difference between the number of cups of sugar and the number of cups of salt needed. This will give us the relative quantity of sugar compared to salt.\n4. **Interpret the Difference**: If the difference is positive, it means Mary needs to add more sugar than salt. If it's negative, she needs to add more salt than sugar.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference in the number of cups between sugar and salt needed, taking into account the flour Mary has already used:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `sugar_salt_difference` that accepts parameters for the initial quantities of flour, sugar, and salt, as well as the amount of flour Mary has already used.\n2. **Calculate Flour Difference**: Inside the rule, subtract the amount of flour Mary has already used from the initial flour requirement.\n3. **Compute Sugar-Salt Difference**: Find the absolute difference between the number of cups of sugar and the number of cups of salt needed.\n4. **Interpret the Result**: Use conditional logic to interpret the result: if the difference is positive, Mary needs more sugar; if it's negative, she needs more salt.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to find out whether Mary needs to add more sugar or salt, providing the initial quantities and the amount of flour already used.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in cups between sugar and salt needed\nsugar_salt_difference(Flour, Sugar, Salt, FlourUsed, Difference) :-\n    RemainingFlour is Flour - FlourUsed,\n    Difference is abs(Sugar - Salt).\n\n% Example query to determine whether Mary needs to add more sugar or salt\n% Given initial quantities: 6 cups flour, 8 cups sugar, 7 cups salt, and Mary already used 5 cups flour\n?- sugar_salt_difference(6, 8, 7, 5, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial quantities and helps determine whether Mary needs to add more sugar or salt.

To find David's count, we add 58 to Zachary's count.\n3. **Total Push-ups**: To get the final answer, we sum up Zachary's count and David's count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the total number of push-ups performed by both individuals. Our Prolog code will be structured as follows:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `total_pushups` that accepts three parameters: `ZacharyPushups`, `DavidPushups`, and `TotalPushups`.\n2. **Calculate David's Count**: Within the rule, compute David's count by adding the given value of 58 to Zachary's count.\n3. **Calculate Total**: Add Zachary's and David's counts to obtain the total number of push-ups.\n4. **Query in Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying mechanism to find the total push-ups by providing the known count for Zachary.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of push-ups\ntotal_pushups(ZacharyPushups, DavidPushups, TotalPushups) :-\n    DavidPushups is ZacharyPushups + 58,\n    TotalPushups is ZacharyPushups + DavidPushups.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of push-ups done by Zachary and David together\n% Given Zachary's push-ups as 44\n?- total_pushups(44, DavidPushups, TotalPushups).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the counts of push-ups performed by Zachary and David, and it computes the total number of push-ups.

On her birthday, Gwen received $2 from her mom and $4 from her dad, resulting in a total gift of $6. Subsequently, she spent $3. To find out how much money she has remaining, we need to subtract her expenditure from the total amount she received.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1.

It also identifies the subject with more pages. The query at the end can be executed in a Prolog environment to get the answer.",

To find out how many more books he bought than sold, we need to calculate the difference between the number of books bought and sold.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up and manipulate equations that represent the given information:\n\n1. Let's represent the unknown number of books sold as 'x'.\n2. We know that after selling books, Paul had 71 - x books remaining.\n3. He then bought 38 new books, increasing his collection to 71 - x + 38.\n4. The current total of 116 books can be represented as 71 - x + 38 = 116.\n5. Solving for 'x', we find that the number of books sold is 33.\n6. Now, we can calculate how many more books he bought than sold: 38 - 33 = 5.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of books bought and sold based on the initial and final book counts. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `books_bought_sold_diff` that accepts five parameters: `InitialBooks`, `SoldBooks`, `BoughtBooks`, `FinalBooks`, and `Diff`.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Books**: Inside the rule, calculate the number of books remaining after selling by subtracting `SoldBooks` from `InitialBooks`.\n3. **Calculate Final Books**: Add the `BoughtBooks` to the remaining books to find the `FinalBooks`.\n4. **Establish Equality**: Set the `FinalBooks` equal to the calculated sum of remaining books and bought books.\n5. **Solve for Diff**: Compute the difference between `BoughtBooks` and `SoldBooks` to find the value of `Diff`.\n6. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the difference between books bought and sold by providing the initial and final book counts, along with the known number of books bought.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between books bought and sold\nbooks_bought_sold_diff(InitialBooks, SoldBooks, BoughtBooks, FinalBooks, Diff) :-\n    RemainingBooks is InitialBooks - SoldBooks,\n    FinalBooks is RemainingBooks + BoughtBooks,\n    Diff is BoughtBooks - SoldBooks.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold\n% Given initial books as 71, bought books as 38, and final books as 116\n?- books_bought_sold_diff(71, SoldBooks, 38, 116, Diff).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the difference between books bought and sold.

        "question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $ 51 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total revenue generated by the Razorback T-shirt shop during a game where they offered discounted T-shirts. Each T-shirt is usually sold for $51, but during the game, they provided a discount of $8 per T-shirt, and they sold 130 T-shirts. The task is to determine the total amount of money the shop made from selling these T-shirts at the discounted price.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Price**: Start with the regular price of each T-shirt, which is $51.\n2. **Discount**: During the game, they offered a discount of $8 per T-shirt.\n3. **Discounted Price**: Calculate the price of each T-shirt after applying the discount (\\$51 - $8).\n4. **Number of T-shirts Sold**: They sold 130 T-shirts.\n5. **Total Revenue**: Multiply the discounted price of one T-shirt by the number of T-shirts sold to find the total revenue generated.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total revenue based on the initial price, the discount, the number of T-shirts sold, and the final discounted price. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_revenue` that accepts five parameters: `RegularPrice`, `Discount`, `DiscountedPrice`, `NumberOfShirtsSold`, and `TotalRevenue`.\n2. **Calculate Discounted Price**: Inside the rule, calculate the discounted price of each T-shirt by subtracting the discount from the regular price.\n3. **Calculate Total Revenue**: Multiply the discounted price by the number of T-shirts sold to obtain the total revenue.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the total revenue by providing the initial conditions (regular price, discount, and number of T-shirts sold).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total revenue from selling discounted t-shirts\ntotal_revenue(RegularPrice, Discount, DiscountedPrice, NumberOfShirtsSold, TotalRevenue) :-\n    DiscountedPrice is RegularPrice - Discount,\n    TotalRevenue is DiscountedPrice * NumberOfShirtsSold.\n\n% Example query to find out the total revenue from selling the t-shirts\n% Given regular price as $51, discount as $8, and number of shirts sold as 130\n?- total_revenue(51, 8, DiscountedPrice, 130, TotalRevenue).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the total revenue generated.

Each pack of DVDs costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 per pack. We want to find out how many packs can be bought with $93. To solve this, we need to calculate the final cost per pack after applying the discount and then determine how many packs the given amount of money can afford.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Cost per Pack**: The original price of each pack is $107.\n2. **Discount per Pack**: There is a discount of $106 applied to each pack.\n3. **Final Cost per Pack**: Calculate the final cost per pack by subtracting the discount from the initial cost.\n4. **Given Budget**: We have $93 to spend.\n5. **Calculate Number of Packs**: Divide the given budget by the final cost per pack to find out how many packs can be purchased.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of packs that can be bought with the given budget.

Here's a structured plan for the code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_earnings` that takes three parameters: `FirstPeriodEarnings`, `SecondPeriodEarnings`, and `TotalEarnings`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `TotalEarnings` is the sum of `FirstPeriodEarnings` and `SecondPeriodEarnings`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find `TotalEarnings` by providing the earnings from the two periods.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total earnings of the ring toss game\ntotal_earnings(FirstPeriodEarnings, SecondPeriodEarnings, TotalEarnings) :-\n    TotalEarnings is FirstPeriodEarnings + SecondPeriodEarnings.\n\n% Example query to find out the total amount of money made by the ring toss game\n% Given earnings in the first period as $382 and in the second period as $374\n?- total_earnings(382, 374, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the earnings in the two periods and computes the total earnings.

To find out how many more people can join, we need to calculate the remaining capacity.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can perform the following arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Total Capacity**: Multiply the number of seats by the capacity of each seat to find the total capacity of the Ferris wheel (6 seats * 14 people per seat).\n2. **Current Occupancy**: We are given that there are currently 16 people on the wheel.\n3. **Remaining Capacity**: To find out how many more people can join, subtract the current occupancy from the total capacity (total capacity - current occupancy).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the remaining capacity based on the total capacity of the Ferris wheel and the current number of people. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `remaining_capacity` that takes three parameters: `TotalCapacity`, `CurrentOccupancy`, and `RemainingCapacity`.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Capacity**: Inside the rule, subtract the `CurrentOccupancy` from the `TotalCapacity` to find how many more people can join.\n3. **Use Prolog's Querying**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the remaining capacity by providing the total capacity and current occupancy.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining capacity of the Ferris wheel\nremaining_capacity(TotalCapacity, CurrentOccupancy, RemainingCapacity) :-\n    RemainingCapacity is TotalCapacity - CurrentOccupancy.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more people can join the Ferris wheel\n% Given total capacity as (6 seats * 14 people per seat) and current occupancy of 16 people\n?- remaining_capacity((6 * 14), 16, RemainingCapacity).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the total capacity, current occupancy, and remaining capacity.

After the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left.

Identify the initial number of pens Paul had: 106 pens.\n2. Identify the number of pens Paul had left after the garage sale: 14 pens.\n3. Calculate the number of pens sold by subtracting the final count from the initial count: \\( 106 - 14 \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of pens sold based on the initial and final counts. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `pens_sold` that takes three parameters: `InitialPens`, `FinalPens`, and `SoldPens`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `SoldPens` is the difference between `InitialPens` and `FinalPens`.\n3.

David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary, but we don't know how many crunches he did. To find out the number of crunches David performed, we need to consider the difference in their push-up counts and the potential difference in their crunches.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the information provided about Zachary's and David's exercises:\n\n1. **Push-ups**: David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can calculate the total number of push-ups David did by adding 29 to Zachary's count.\n2. **Crunches**: We know that David did 13 fewer crunches than Zachary. This means we can calculate the number of crunches David did by subtracting 13 from Zachary's count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define rules to calculate the number of push-ups and crunches for David based on the given information.

Since Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up an equation to find out how many cups of flour she has already added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n- The recipe requires 3 cups of sugar.\n- The recipe requires 10 cups of flour.\n- Mary needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, which means the remaining cups of flour is 5 cups more than the remaining cups of sugar.\n\nWe can represent this relationship as an equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Remaining Flour} = \\text{Remaining Sugar} + 5 \\]\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will involve defining rules to capture the relationships between the required amounts of sugar and flour, as well as the remaining amounts.

Define constants for the required amounts of sugar (`required_sugar`) and flour (`required_flour`):\n   ```prolog\n   required_sugar(3).\n   required_flour(10).\n   ```\n2.

Define a rule `calculate_added_flour` to compute the number of cups of flour Mary already added:\n   ```prolog\n   calculate_added_flour(AddedFlour) :-\n       required_sugar(RequiredSugar),\n       required_flour(RequiredFlour),\n       AddedFlour is RequiredFlour - RemainingFlour,\n       remaining_relationship(RequiredSugar, RemainingFlour).\n   ```\n4.

Our plan includes the following steps:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `remaining_blocks` that accepts four parameters: `TotalBlocks`, `BlocksForTower`, `BlocksForHouse`, and `Remaining`.\n2. **Calculate Blocks Used**: Within the rule, calculate the total number of blocks used by summing `BlocksForTower` and `BlocksForHouse`.\n3. **Compute Remaining Blocks**: Subtract the total blocks used from the `TotalBlocks` to determine the `Remaining` blocks.\n4. **Query in Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to find the value of `Remaining` blocks by providing the initial total and the blocks used for the tower and the house.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining number of blocks\nremaining_blocks(TotalBlocks, BlocksForTower, BlocksForHouse, Remaining) :-\n    TotalUsed is BlocksForTower + BlocksForHouse,\n    Remaining is TotalBlocks - TotalUsed.\n\n% Example query to find out how many blocks Randy has left\n% Given total blocks as 79, blocks used for tower as 14, and blocks used for house as 11\n?- remaining_blocks(79, 14, 11, Remaining).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial total blocks, the blocks used for the tower and house, and the remaining blocks. Executing the query will provide the answer to how many blocks Randy has left.",

Ryan spends 5 hours every day on learning Chinese.\n2. He spends some additional hours on learning English.\n3. The number of hours he spends on English is 2 hours more than the number of hours he spends on Chinese.\n\nTo find the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English, we need to set up an equation:\n- Let 'x' be the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English.\n- Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese.\n- He spends 2 hours more on English than Chinese: x = 5 hours + 2 hours.\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x' to find the number of hours he spends on learning English.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English based on the given conditions.

        "question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMary is in the process of baking a cake, and she needs to manage the quantities of flour and sugar. The cake recipe requires a specific amount of each ingredient: 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. However, she has already used 4 cups of flour. Now, she wants to know how the amounts of sugar and flour she still needs to add compare. Specifically, she wants to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add compared to the cups of flour.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. **Remaining Flour**: First, we need to determine how much flour Mary still needs to add. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount of flour she has already used (4 cups) from the total amount of flour required (9 cups).\n2. **Sugar Needed**: Next, we find out how much sugar Mary needs to add by subtracting the remaining flour (from step 1) from the total amount of sugar required (11 cups).\n3. **Comparison**: Finally, we compare the amount of sugar needed with the amount of flour needed to find the difference. This difference will tell us how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add compared to flour.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define rules that perform these calculations and comparisons. Here's a structured plan:\n1. **Define Rules**:\n   - `remaining_flour(UsedFlour, TotalFlour, RemainingFlour)` - This rule calculates the remaining flour needed by subtracting the used flour from the total flour required.\n   - `sugar_needed(RemainingFlour, TotalSugar, SugarNeeded)` - This rule calculates the amount of sugar Mary needs to add, taking into account the remaining flour.\n   - `compare_ingredients(SugarNeeded, RemainingFlour, Difference)` - This rule compares the amount of sugar needed with the remaining flour to find the difference.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to perform subtraction for the `remaining_flour` and `sugar_needed` rules.\n   - For the `compare_ingredients` rule, subtract `RemainingFlour` from `SugarNeeded` to get the `Difference`.\n3. **Query**:\n   - Write a query that uses these rules to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add compared to flour. Provide the initial conditions, such as the used flour, total flour, and total sugar.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Rule to calculate the remaining flour needed\nremaining_flour(UsedFlour, TotalFlour, RemainingFlour) :-\n    RemainingFlour is TotalFlour - UsedFlour.\n\n% Rule to calculate the amount of sugar Mary needs to add\nsugar_needed(RemainingFlour, TotalSugar, SugarNeeded) :-\n    SugarNeeded is TotalSugar - RemainingFlour.\n\n% Rule to compare the amount of sugar needed with the remaining flour\ncompare_ingredients(SugarNeeded, RemainingFlour, Difference) :-\n    Difference is SugarNeeded - RemainingFlour.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add\n% Provide initial conditions: used flour, total flour, and total sugar\n?- remaining_flour(4, 9, RemainingFlour),\n   sugar_needed(RemainingFlour, 11, SugarNeeded),\n   compare_ingredients(SugarNeeded, RemainingFlour, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a set of rules to perform the required calculations and comparisons.

The task is to determine how much more expensive a T-shirt is compared to a jersey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. **Profit per T-shirt**: Determine the total profit made from selling one T-shirt, which is $240.\n2. **Profit per Jersey**: Calculate the total profit made from selling one jersey, which is $210.\n3. **Price Difference**: Find the difference between the profit made from one T-shirt and one jersey to determine how much more expensive the T-shirt is.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define rules to calculate the profit per item and then compute the price difference.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Daily Chinese Hours**: Identify the number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese each day, which is given as 4 hours.\n2. **Number of Days**: Determine the total number of days Ryan follows this routine, which is specified as 6 days.\n3. **Total Chinese Hours**: Calculate the total number of hours spent on learning Chinese by multiplying the daily hours by the number of days.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that encapsulates the relationship between Ryan's daily language learning routine and the total time spent on learning Chinese over a certain number of days. Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `total_learning_hours` that accepts three parameters: `DailyChineseHours`, `NumberOfDays`, and `TotalChineseHours`.\n2. **Calculate Total Hours**: Inside the rule, compute the total number of hours spent on learning Chinese by multiplying `DailyChineseHours` by `NumberOfDays`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to determine `TotalChineseHours` by providing the daily hours spent on learning Chinese and the number of days Ryan follows this routine.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of hours spent on learning Chinese\ntotal_learning_hours(DailyChineseHours, NumberOfDays, TotalChineseHours) :-\n    TotalChineseHours is DailyChineseHours * NumberOfDays.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese\n% Given daily Chinese hours as 4 and number of days as 6\n?- total_learning_hours(4, 6, TotalChineseHours).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between Ryan's daily language learning routine and the total time spent on learning Chinese.

Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `Difference` is the result of subtracting `AfternoonEmails` from `MorningEmails`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find out the value of `Difference` by providing the known values of `MorningEmails` and `AfternoonEmails`.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in emails received between morning and afternoon\nemails_difference(MorningEmails, AfternoonEmails, Difference) :-\n    Difference is MorningEmails - AfternoonEmails.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning\n% Given morning emails as 10 and afternoon emails as 7\n?- emails_difference(10, 7, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the difference in the number of emails received between the morning and afternoon.

Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `roses_in_garden`**: This rule will take four arguments - `InitialVaseRoses`, `TotalGardenRoses`, `FinalVaseRoses`, and `RemainingGardenRoses`.\n2. **Arithmetic operations**: \n    - Calculate the number of roses cut by finding the difference between `FinalVaseRoses` and `InitialVaseRoses`.\n    - Determine `RemainingGardenRoses` by subtracting the number of roses cut from `TotalGardenRoses`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of roses remaining in the garden given the initial counts and the final count in the vase.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of roses remaining in the flower garden\nroses_in_garden(InitialVaseRoses, TotalGardenRoses, FinalVaseRoses, RemainingGardenRoses) :-\n    RosesCut is FinalVaseRoses - InitialVaseRoses,\n    RemainingGardenRoses is TotalGardenRoses - RosesCut.\n\n% Example query to find out how many roses are left in the flower garden\n% Given initial vase roses as 13, total garden roses as 12, and final vase roses as 21\n?- roses_in_garden(13, 12, 21, RemainingGardenRoses).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial and final counts of roses in the vase and the total roses in the garden.

Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Rules for Push-ups and Crunches**: Create two rules, `push_ups(Person, Count)` and `crunches(Person, Count)`, where `Person` is either 'Zachary' or 'David', and `Count` is the corresponding number of push-ups or crunches.\n2. **David's Performance Relative to Zachary**: Define rules to calculate David's performance based on his relation to Zachary's performance.\n3. **Calculate Crunches Difference**: Create a rule `more_crunches_than_push_ups(Count)` to compute how many more crunches Zachary did compared to push-ups.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the value of `Count` in the `more_crunches_than_push_ups` rule.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Rule for Zachary's push-ups\npush_ups(zachary, 5).\n\n% Rule for Zachary's crunches\ncrunches(zachary, 17).\n\n% Rule for David's push-ups relative to Zachary\npush_ups(david, Count) :-\n    push_ups(zachary, ZacharyPushUps),\n    Count is ZacharyPushUps + 27.\n\n% Rule for David's crunches relative to Zachary\ncrunches(david, Count) :-\n    crunches(zachary, ZacharyCrunches),\n    Count is ZacharyCrunches - 7.\n\n% Rule to calculate how many more crunches Zachary did than push-ups\nmore_crunches_than_push_ups(Count) :-\n    crunches(zachary, Crunches),\n    push_ups(zachary, PushUps),\n    Count is Crunches - PushUps.\n\n% Query to find out how many more crunches Zachary did than push-ups\n?- more_crunches_than_push_ups(Count).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the performance of Zachary and David for push-ups and crunches, and then computes how many more crunches Zachary did compared to push-ups. The query at the end will provide the answer when executed in a Prolog environment.",

To find the answer, we need to divide the total number of junk mails by the number of junk mails given to each house.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. Identify the total number of junk mails the mailman has to deliver to each block: 14 pieces.\n2. Identify the number of junk mails given to each house: 2 pieces.\n3. Calculate the number of houses in each block by dividing the total number of junk mails by the number of junk mails given to each house: \\( 14 \\div 2 \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of houses in a block based on the total number of junk mails and the number of junk mails given to each house. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `houses_in_block` that takes three variables: `TotalJunkMails`, `JunkMailPerHouse`, and `NumberOfHouses`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `NumberOfHouses` is the result of dividing `TotalJunkMails` by `JunkMailPerHouse`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `NumberOfHouses` given the total number of junk mails and the number of junk mails per house.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of houses in a block\nhouses_in_block(TotalJunkMails, JunkMailPerHouse, NumberOfHouses) :-\n    NumberOfHouses is TotalJunkMails // JunkMailPerHouse.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of houses in a block\n% Given total junk mails as 14 and 2 junk mails given to each house\n?- houses_in_block(14, 2, NumberOfHouses).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the number of houses in a block based on the given total number of junk mails and the number of junk mails delivered to each house.

Jill has 12 peaches.\n2. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, so we add 15 to Jill's count to find Steven's total.\n3.

The goal is to find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped compared to the mouse.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1.

Identify the initial number of storks: 6 storks.\n2. Identify the initial number of birds: 2 birds.\n3. Calculate the total number of birds after 3 more birds join: \\( 2 + 3 \\).\n4. Find the difference between the total number of storks and the total number of birds to determine how many more storks are on the fence.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of storks and birds on the fence. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `storks_vs_birds`**: This rule will take four arguments - `InitialStorks`, `InitialBirds`, `AdditionalBirds`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate the total number of birds**: Add `AdditionalBirds` to the `InitialBirds`.\n3. **Compute the difference**: Subtract the total number of birds from the number of storks (`InitialStorks`) to find `Difference`.\n4. **Query using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out how many more storks are on the fence given the initial counts and the additional birds.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between the number of storks and birds\nstorks_vs_birds(InitialStorks, InitialBirds, AdditionalBirds, Difference) :-\n    TotalBirds is InitialBirds + AdditionalBirds,\n    Difference is InitialStorks - TotalBirds.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more storks than birds are on the fence\n% Given initial storks as 6, initial birds as 2, and additional birds as 3\n?- storks_vs_birds(6, 2, 3, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the counts of storks and birds and computes the difference.

Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `ferris_wheel_seats`**: This rule will take three parameters - `SeatCapacity`, `TotalRiders`, and `NumberOfSeats`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the number of seats. Divide `TotalRiders` by `SeatCapacity` to find `NumberOfSeats`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that utilizes this rule to determine the number of seats on the Ferris wheel given the capacity per seat and the total number of riders.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of seats on the Ferris wheel\nferris_wheel_seats(SeatCapacity, TotalRiders, NumberOfSeats) :-\n    NumberOfSeats is TotalRiders // SeatCapacity.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of seats on the Ferris wheel\n% Given seat capacity as 9 and total riders as 18\n?- ferris_wheel_seats(9, 18, NumberOfSeats).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the capacity per seat and the total number of riders to compute the number of seats on the Ferris wheel.

The grasshopper jumped 39 inches, and it is given that the grasshopper's jump was 19 inches farther than the frog's jump. Additionally, the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog. To find the distance jumped by the mouse, we need to consider the relationships between these jumps.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve for the mouse's jump distance, we can set up and manipulate equations based on the given information:\n\n1. Let F represent the frog's jump distance.\n2. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches more than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump (G) can be represented as \\( G = F + 19 \\).\n3. The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump (M) can be represented as \\( M = F - 12 \\).\n4. Now, we have three equations:\n   - \\( F + 19 = 39 \\)\n   - \\( M = F - 12 \\)\n5.

        "question": "There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets, how many green peaches are in each basket?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe are given that there are two baskets of peaches, and each basket contains the same number of peaches. In total, there are 12 peaches across both baskets. Out of these, 8 peaches are specifically identified as red (4 in each basket). The task is to determine the number of green peaches in each basket.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up and solve a simple equation:\n\n1. **Total Peaches**: We know there are 12 peaches in total.\n2. **Red Peaches**: There are 8 red peaches in total, which is 4 in each basket.\n3. **Green Peaches**: The unknown quantity we want to find. Let's represent this as 'G'.\n4. **Equation Setup**: In each basket, the total number of peaches is 4 red + G green peaches.\n5. **Solving for Green Peaches**: Since both baskets have the same number of peaches, we can set up the equation as: \n    - (4 red + G green) + (4 red + G green) = 12 total peaches\n6. **Solving**: Simplifying the equation, we get: \n     - 8 red + 2G green = 12\n7. **Isolating G**: To find the number of green peaches in each basket, we isolate G:\n     - 2G = 12 - 8\n     - 2G = 4\n     - G = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 green peaches in each basket.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of green peaches in each basket based on the given constraints. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `green_peaches_in_basket` that accepts three parameters: `RedPeaches`, `TotalPeaches`, and `GreenPeaches`.\n2. **Calculate Green Peaches**: Inside the rule, calculate the number of green peaches in one basket by subtracting the number of red peaches from the total peaches, and then divide by 2, as each basket has the same number of peaches.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the number of green peaches in each basket by providing the total number of peaches and the number of red peaches.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of green peaches in each basket\ngreen_peaches_in_basket(RedPeaches, TotalPeaches, GreenPeaches) :-\n    GreenPeaches is (TotalPeaches - RedPeaches) // 2.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of green peaches in each basket\n% Given total peaches as 12 and red peaches as 8 (4 in each basket)\n?- green_peaches_in_basket(8, 12, GreenPeaches).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the given constraints and the unknown quantity (green peaches).

She has already put 4 cups of sugar into the mixture, but the recipe calls for a total of 7 cups of sugar. To find out how many additional cups of sugar are required, we need to perform a simple subtraction calculation.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved with basic arithmetic:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of sugar required by the recipe: 7 cups.\n2. Recognize the amount of sugar Mary has already used: 4 cups.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount of sugar needed: Subtract the amount of sugar already used from the total required amount.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the additional sugar needed based on the total required sugar and the amount already used. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `sugar_needed`**: Create a rule with three parameters - `TotalSugar`, `UsedSugar`, and `NeededSugar`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Calculate `NeededSugar` by subtracting `UsedSugar` from `TotalSugar`.\n3. **Query Using SWI-Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out how much more sugar Mary needs to add by providing the total required sugar and the amount she has already used.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the additional sugar needed\nsugar_needed(TotalSugar, UsedSugar, NeededSugar) :-\n    NeededSugar is TotalSugar - UsedSugar.\n\n% Example query to find out how much more sugar Mary needs to add\n% Given total required sugar as 7 cups and already used sugar as 4 cups\n?- sugar_needed(7, 4, NeededSugar).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the total required sugar, the amount already used, and the additional sugar needed.

The goal is to determine how far the frog jumped.
