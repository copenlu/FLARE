After planting, the total number of trees increased to 21. The difference between the final and initial number of trees will give us the number of trees planted on that day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Initial number of trees**: 15 trees.\n2. **Final number of trees after planting**: 21 trees.\n3. **Calculation**: The number of trees planted is the difference between the final number of trees and the initial number of trees.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of trees planted based on the initial and final counts. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `plant_trees`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialTrees`, `FinalTrees`, and `PlantedTrees`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the difference between `FinalTrees` and `InitialTrees`, which gives `PlantedTrees`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of trees planted given the initial and final counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of trees planted\nplant_trees(InitialTrees, FinalTrees, PlantedTrees) :-\n    PlantedTrees is FinalTrees - InitialTrees.\n\n% Example query to find out how many trees were planted today\n% Given initial trees as 15 and final trees as 21\n?- plant_trees(15, 21, PlantedTrees).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the initial and final tree counts and computes the number of trees planted.

Identify the initial number of children on the bus: 36 children.\n2. Identify the number of children who got off the bus: 68 children.\n3. Identify the total number of children on the bus after some got off and some got on: 12 children.\n4. Calculate the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who got on.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of children who got off the bus and the number of children who got on. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `children_difference` that takes three parameters: `InitialChildren`, `ChildrenOff`, and `ChildrenOn`.\n2. Calculate the total number of children who got off the bus by subtracting the final count from the initial count.\n3. Calculate the total number of children who got on the bus by subtracting the initial count from the final count.\n4. Calculate the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who got on.\n5. Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the difference between the two counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between children who got off and got on the bus\nchildren_difference(InitialChildren, ChildrenOff, ChildrenOn, Difference) :-\n    TotalOff is InitialChildren - ChildrenOn,\n    TotalOn is ChildrenOn - InitialChildren,\n    Difference is TotalOff - TotalOn.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more children got off the bus than those who got on\n% Given initial children as 36, children off as 68, and children on as 12\n?- children_difference(36, 68, 12, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `cost_per_tshirt` that takes two parameters: `TotalRevenue` and `NumTshirts`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: Cost per t-shirt is the total revenue divided by the number of t-shirts sold.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for the cost per t-shirt given the total revenue and the number of t-shirts sold.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the cost per t-shirt\ncost_per_tshirt(TotalRevenue, NumTshirts, CostPerTshirt) :-\n    CostPerTshirt is TotalRevenue / NumTshirts.\n\n% Example query to find out the cost of each t-shirt\n% Given total revenue as $51 and number of t-shirts sold as 3\n?- cost_per_tshirt(51, 3, CostPerTshirt).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the total revenue, the number of t-shirts sold, and the cost per t-shirt.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `more_birds_than_storks`**: This rule will take four parameters - `InitialBirds`, `AdditionalBirds`, `AdditionalStorks`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate Total Count**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of birds and storks on the fence.\n3. **Calculate Difference**: Find the difference between the number of birds and storks to determine how many more birds are there than storks.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the difference given the initial conditions and additional birds and storks.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between the number of birds and storks on the fence\nmore_birds_than_storks(InitialBirds, AdditionalBirds, AdditionalStorks, Difference) :-\n    TotalBirds is InitialBirds + AdditionalBirds,\n    TotalStorks is AdditionalStorks,\n    Difference is TotalBirds - TotalStorks.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence\n% Given initial birds as 2, additional birds as 5, and additional storks as 4\n?- more_birds_than_storks(2, 5, 4, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

The task is to calculate how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of bottle caps found at the park: 30 bottle caps.\n2. Identify the initial number of wrappers found at the park: 14 wrappers.\n3.

Lewis earns $491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest and has to pay $216 in rent each week. The final amount of money he will have can be determined by subtracting the total rent paid from the total earnings over the harvest period.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify Lewis's weekly earnings: $491.\n2. Identify the number of weeks during the harvest season: 1181 weeks.\n3. Identify the weekly rent payment: $216.\n4.

Calculate the total number of bottles by adding the number of regular soda bottles, diet soda bottles, and apples.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total number of bottles in the grocery store. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_bottles` that takes three variables: `RegularSoda`, `DietSoda`, `Apples`, and `TotalBottles`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `TotalBottles` is the sum of `RegularSoda`, `DietSoda`, and `Apples`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `TotalBottles` given the counts of regular soda bottles, diet soda bottles, and apples.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of bottles in the grocery store\ntotal_bottles(RegularSoda, DietSoda, Apples, TotalBottles) :-\n    TotalBottles is RegularSoda + DietSoda + Apples.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of bottles in the grocery store\n% Given regular soda bottles as 30, diet soda bottles as 8, and apples as 41\n?- total_bottles(30, 8, 41, TotalBottles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the total number of bottles in the grocery store based on the given counts of regular soda bottles, diet soda bottles, and apples.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task is to determine how much farther a group needs to travel to reach the end of a cave. The cave is 1218 feet deep, and the group is currently at a depth of 849 feet. Given that they are traveling at a speed of 17 feet, we can calculate the remaining distance they need to cover to reach the end of the cave.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. Identify the total depth of the cave: 1218 feet.\n2. Identify the current depth of the group: 849 feet.\n3. Calculate the remaining distance to reach the end of the cave: Total depth - Current depth.\n4. Given the speed of travel (17 feet), calculate the time it will take to cover the remaining distance.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the remaining distance the group needs to travel to reach the end of the cave. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `remaining_distance`**: This rule will take three arguments - `TotalDepth`, `CurrentDepth`, and `Speed`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the remaining distance as the difference between `TotalDepth` and `CurrentDepth`.\n3. **Calculate time**: Optionally, calculate the time it will take to cover the remaining distance by dividing the remaining distance by the speed.\n4. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the remaining distance given the total depth, current depth, and speed.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining distance to reach the end of the cave\nremaining_distance(TotalDepth, CurrentDepth, Speed, RemainingDistance) :-\n    RemainingDistance is TotalDepth - CurrentDepth.\n\n% Example query to find out how much farther until they reach the end of the cave\n% Given total depth as 1218 feet, current depth as 849 feet, and speed as 17 feet\n?- remaining_distance(1218, 849, 17, RemainingDistance).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a rule that calculates the remaining distance the group needs to travel based on the given depths and speed.

Initially, Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes. To find out how many crackers each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of crackers Matthew had: 22 crackers.\n2. Identify the total number of friends: 11 friends.\n3. Calculate the total number of crackers eaten by dividing the initial number of crackers by the number of friends: \\( \\frac{22}{11} \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial number of crackers, the number of friends, and the number of crackers each person ate.

Identify the initial number of pastries made by Baker: 56 pastries.\n2. Identify the initial number of cakes made by Baker: 124 cakes.\n3. Determine the number of cakes sold: 104 cakes.\n4. Determine the number of pastries sold: 29 pastries.\n5. Calculate the total number of pastries Baker would still have by subtracting the pastries sold from the initial count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of pastries Baker would still have based on the initial counts and the number of pastries and cakes sold. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_pastries` that takes four parameters: `InitialPastries`, `InitialCakes`, `SoldCakes`, `SoldPastries`, and `RemainingPastries`.\n2. Calculate the total pastries sold by adding the number of pastries and cakes sold.\n3. Subtract the total pastries sold from the initial count of pastries to find the remaining pastries.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to determine the number of pastries Baker would still have.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of pastries Baker would still have\nremaining_pastries(InitialPastries, InitialCakes, SoldCakes, SoldPastries, RemainingPastries) :-\n    TotalSoldPastries is SoldCakes + SoldPastries,\n    RemainingPastries is InitialPastries - TotalSoldPastries.\n\n% Example query to find out how many pastries Baker would still have\n% Given initial pastries as 56, initial cakes as 124, sold cakes as 104, and sold pastries as 29\n?- remaining_pastries(56, 124, 104, 29, RemainingPastries).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the number of pastries Baker would still have based on the given initial counts and the number of pastries and cakes sold.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_cakes` that takes three parameters: `InitialCakes`, `CakesSold`, and `CakesAdded`, and calculates the final count.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Cakes**: Subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial count to find the remaining cakes.\n3. **Calculate Final Count**: Add the remaining cakes to the number of cakes added to determine the final count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the final number of cakes based on the provided data.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of cakes the baker would have\ntotal_cakes(InitialCakes, CakesSold, CakesAdded, FinalCakes) :-\n    RemainingCakes is InitialCakes - CakesSold,\n    FinalCakes is RemainingCakes + CakesAdded.\n\n% Query to find out how many cakes the baker would still have\n% Given initial cakes as 110, cakes sold as 75, and cakes added as 76\n?- total_cakes(110, 75, 76, FinalCakes).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task involves determining the size of each group when organizing Steven's skittles and erasers into a certain number of groups. Steven has 4502 skittles and 4276 erasers, which need to be divided into 154 groups. To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of items by the number of groups.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of skittles: 4502 skittles.\n2. Identify the total number of erasers: 4276 erasers.\n3. Determine the total number of items: Sum of skittles and erasers.\n4.

        "question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Mary is baking a cake and needs to determine how many more cups of sugar she needs to add to meet the recipe requirements. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar, and she has already added 4 cups. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we need to calculate the difference between the total required sugar and the sugar already added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by following these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of sugar required for the recipe: 7 cups.\n2. Determine the amount of sugar Mary has already added: 4 cups.\n3. Calculate the additional sugar needed by subtracting the amount already added from the total required sugar: \\(7 - 4\\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the additional cups of sugar needed based on the amount already added and the total required. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `additional_sugar_needed` that takes three parameters: `TotalSugarRequired`, `SugarAlreadyAdded`, and `AdditionalSugarNeeded`.\n2. Express the relationship between these parameters using arithmetic operations: the additional sugar needed is the difference between the total required sugar and the sugar already added.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `AdditionalSugarNeeded` given the total sugar required and the amount already added.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the additional cups of sugar needed\nadditional_sugar_needed(TotalSugarRequired, SugarAlreadyAdded, AdditionalSugarNeeded) :-\n    AdditionalSugarNeeded is TotalSugarRequired - SugarAlreadyAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add\n% Given total sugar required as 7 cups and sugar already added as 4 cups\n?- additional_sugar_needed(7, 4, AdditionalSugarNeeded).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the total sugar required, the sugar already added, and the additional sugar needed.
