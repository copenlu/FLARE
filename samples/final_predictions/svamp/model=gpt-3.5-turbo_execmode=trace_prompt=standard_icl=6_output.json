To find out how much money she has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bagels and then subtract this amount from her initial money.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount of money Olivia has: $23.\n2. Identify the number of bagels purchased: 5 bagels.\n3. Identify the cost of each bagel: $3 per bagel.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the bagels: \\( 5 \\times 3 \\).\n5. Subtract the total cost of the bagels from Olivia's initial amount of money to find out how much money she has left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial amount of money, the number of bagels purchased, the cost per bagel, and the remaining amount of money. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_remaining_money` that takes four variables: `InitialMoney`, `BagelsPurchased`, `CostPerBagel`, and `RemainingMoney`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total cost of the bagels is the product of `BagelsPurchased` and `CostPerBagel`.\n3. The remaining amount of money is the difference between the initial amount of money and the total cost of the bagels.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `RemainingMoney` given the initial amount of money, the number of bagels purchased, and the cost per bagel.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining amount of money after buying bagels\ncalculate_remaining_money(InitialMoney, BagelsPurchased, CostPerBagel, RemainingMoney) :-\n    TotalCost is BagelsPurchased * CostPerBagel,\n    RemainingMoney is InitialMoney - TotalCost.\n\n% Example query to find out how much money Olivia has left\n% Given initial money as 23, bagels purchased as 5, and cost per bagel as 3\n?- calculate_remaining_money(23, 5, 3, RemainingMoney).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the remaining amount of money based on the given initial amount, the number of bagels purchased, and the cost per bagel.

Identify the initial number of children on the bus: 28 children.\n2. Identify the number of children who got on the bus at the stop: 82 children.\n3. Identify the final count of children on the bus: 30 children.\n4. Calculate the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who got off to find out how many more children got on the bus.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who got off. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `more_children_on_bus` that takes three parameters: `InitialChildren`, `ChildrenGotOn`, and `FinalChildren`.\n2. **Calculate Difference**: Inside the rule, calculate the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number of children who were initially on the bus.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine how many more children got on the bus than those who got off by providing the initial conditions and the final count.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in the number of children on the bus\nmore_children_on_bus(InitialChildren, ChildrenGotOn, MoreChildren) :-\n    MoreChildren is ChildrenGotOn - InitialChildren.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more children got on the bus than those who got off\n% Given initial children as 28, children who got on as 82, and final children as 30\n?- more_children_on_bus(28, 82, MoreChildren).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome. By executing the query, Prolog will compute how many more children got on the bus than those who got off based on the provided data.",

Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the palace on a particular day, while there were 600 visitors the previous day. The task is to calculate how many more visitors visited the palace on the current day compared to the previous day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by performing a simple arithmetic operation:\n\n1. Identify the number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the current day: 661 visitors.\n2. Identify the number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the previous day: 600 visitors.\n3.

Identify Fred's initial amount: 19 dollars.\n2. Identify Fred's current amount: 40 dollars.\n3. Calculate the difference between Fred's initial and current amounts to determine how much he earned over the weekend: \\( 40 - 19 \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the amount of money Fred earned over the weekend based on the given information. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `earnings_over_weekend` that takes three variables: `InitialAmountFred`, `CurrentAmountFred`, and `EarningsFred`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `EarningsFred` is the difference between `CurrentAmountFred` and `InitialAmountFred`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `EarningsFred` given Fred's initial and current amounts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate Fred's earnings over the weekend\nearnings_over_weekend(InitialAmountFred, CurrentAmountFred, EarningsFred) :-\n    EarningsFred is CurrentAmountFred - InitialAmountFred.\n\n% Example query to find out how much money Fred earned over the weekend\n% Given initial amount for Fred as 19 dollars and current amount as 40 dollars\n?- earnings_over_weekend(19, 40, EarningsFred).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship and computes the amount of money Fred earned over the weekend based on the provided initial and current amounts.

Calculate the number of packages by dividing the total number of t-shirts by the number of t-shirts in each package.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that captures the relationship between the total number of t-shirts, the number of t-shirts in each package, and the number of packages. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_packages` that takes three variables: `TotalTshirts`, `TshirtsPerPackage`, and `TotalPackages`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total number of packages is the total number of t-shirts divided by the number of t-shirts in each package.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `TotalPackages` given the total number of t-shirts and the number of t-shirts in each package.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of packages of white t-shirts\ncalculate_packages(TotalTshirts, TshirtsPerPackage, TotalPackages) :-\n    TotalPackages is TotalTshirts // TshirtsPerPackage.\n\n% Example query to find out how many packages mom will have\n% Given total white t-shirts as 66 and t-shirts per package as 3\n?- calculate_packages(66, 3, TotalPackages).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship and computes the number of packages of white t-shirts based on the given total count and the number of t-shirts in each package.

Frank initially had 16 pieces of candy, and he distributed them equally into two bags. To find out how many pieces of candy are in each bag, we need to divide the total number of candies by the number of bags.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by following these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of pieces of candy Frank had: 16 pieces.\n2. Identify the number of bags the candies were divided into: 2 bags.\n3. Divide the total number of candies by the number of bags to find out how many pieces of candy are in each bag: \\( \\frac{16}{2} \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of pieces of candy in each bag based on the total number of candies and the number of bags.

Luke gained 3 points in each round of the game, and his total score was 78 points. To find out how many rounds he played, we need to divide the total score by the points gained in each round.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by following these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of points Luke scored in the trivia game: 78 points.\n2. Identify the number of points Luke gained in each round: 3 points.\n3. Calculate the number of rounds played by dividing the total score by the points gained in each round: \\( \\frac{78}{3} \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of rounds based on the total score and points gained per round.

Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_sweet_cookies` that takes three variables: `InitialSweetCookies`, `EatenSweetCookies`, and `RemainingSweetCookies`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the remaining sweet cookies are the initial count minus the number eaten.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `RemainingSweetCookies` given the initial number of sweet cookies and the number eaten.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining number of sweet cookies\nremaining_sweet_cookies(InitialSweetCookies, EatenSweetCookies, RemainingSweetCookies) :-\n    RemainingSweetCookies is InitialSweetCookies - EatenSweetCookies.\n\n% Query to find out how many sweet cookies Paco has left\n% Given initial sweet cookies as 22 and sweet cookies eaten as 15\n?- remaining_sweet_cookies(22, 15, RemainingSweetCookies).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial number of sweet cookies and the number eaten to compute the remaining sweet cookies.

To find the remaining number of bird families, we need to subtract the families that flew away and add the new families that arrived.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Initial number of bird families**: 49 families.\n2. **Number of bird families that flew away**: 59 families.\n3. **Number of new bird families that arrived**: 24 families.\n4. **Total change in bird families**: Subtract the families that flew away and add the new families that arrived.\n5. **Remaining bird families**: Subtract the total change from the initial number of families.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of bird families left near the mountain based on the given information.

Initially, Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad and an additional 2 dollars from her mom. If she spent 6 dollars, we need to calculate the difference between the amount received from her dad and mom to find out how much more she received from her dad.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. Identify the amount Gwen received from her dad: 5 dollars.\n2. Identify the amount Gwen received from her mom: 2 dollars.\n3. Calculate the total amount received from both parents: \\(5 + 2\\).\n4.

Each bus cannot have more than 36 people. We need to calculate the total number of people on the bus after the additional passengers board, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum capacity of 36 people.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of people on the bus: 12 people.\n2. Identify the number of people who got on the bus at the next stop: 4 people.\n3. Calculate the total number of people on the bus after the new passengers board: \\(12 + 4\\).\n4. Check if the total number exceeds the maximum capacity of 36 people.\n5. If the total number exceeds 36, set the total number to 36.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a rule that calculates the total number of people on the bus while considering the maximum capacity.

Add a condition to check if `TotalPeople` exceeds the maximum capacity of 36 people and adjust it if necessary.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `TotalPeople` given the initial number of people and the number of new passengers.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of people on the bus\ntotal_people_on_bus(InitialPeople, NewPeople, TotalPeople) :-\n    TempTotal is InitialPeople + NewPeople,\n    (TempTotal > 36 -> TotalPeople = 36 ; TotalPeople = TempTotal).\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of people on the bus\n% Given initial people as 12 and new people as 4\n?- total_people_on_bus(12, 4, TotalPeople).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the total number of people on the bus, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum capacity of 36 people.

By understanding the initial count, the remaining count, and the number of friends, we can calculate the number of crackers Matthew shared with each friend.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Matthew started with 31 crackers.\n2. **Remaining Count**: After sharing with his friends, he has 23 crackers left.\n3. **Number of Friends**: Matthew shared equally with 5 friends.\n4. **Total Crackers Shared**: The total number of crackers shared is the difference between the initial count and the remaining count.\n5. **Crackers Shared per Friend**: Divide the total shared crackers by the number of friends to find out how many crackers each friend received.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of crackers shared with each friend based on the initial count, the remaining count, and the number of friends. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `crackers_shared_per_friend` that accepts three parameters: `InitialCrackers`, `RemainingCrackers`, and `NumFriends`.\n2. **Calculate Total Shared**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of crackers shared as the difference between the initial count and the remaining count.\n3. **Calculate Shared per Friend**: Divide the total shared crackers by the number of friends to determine the number of crackers each friend received.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend by providing the initial and remaining counts, and the number of friends.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of crackers shared per friend\ncrackers_shared_per_friend(InitialCrackers, RemainingCrackers, NumFriends, CrackersPerFriend) :-\n    TotalShared is InitialCrackers - RemainingCrackers,\n    CrackersPerFriend is TotalShared / NumFriends.\n\n% Example query to find out how many crackers Matthew gave to each friend\n% Given initial crackers as 31, remaining crackers as 23, and number of friends as 5\n?- crackers_shared_per_friend(31, 23, 5, CrackersPerFriend).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial and remaining counts, and the number of friends, to calculate the number of crackers shared with each friend.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task is to determine the number of crackers Matthew gave to each of his 3 friends. Initially, Matthew had 24 crackers. After giving an equal number of crackers to each friend, he was left with 17 crackers. The number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend can be calculated by finding the difference between the initial count and the count he had left.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of crackers Matthew had: 24 crackers.\n2. Identify the number of crackers Matthew had left after giving to his friends: 17 crackers.\n3. Calculate the total number of crackers given to his friends by finding the difference between the initial count and the count he had left: \\(24 - 17\\).\n4. Since the crackers were given equally to 3 friends, we need to divide the total number of crackers given by 3 to find out how many crackers each friend received.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of crackers given to each friend based on the initial and final counts. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `give_crackers`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialCrackers`, `FinalCrackers`, and `GivenCrackers`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the difference between `InitialCrackers` and `FinalCrackers`, which gives `GivenCrackers`.\n3. **Divide the total crackers given by 3**: Since the crackers were given equally to 3 friends, divide `GivenCrackers` by 3 to find out how many crackers each friend received.\n4. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of crackers given to each friend given the initial and final counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of crackers given to each friend\ngive_crackers(InitialCrackers, FinalCrackers, GivenCrackers) :-\n    GivenCrackers is InitialCrackers - FinalCrackers.\n\n% Define a rule to calculate the number of crackers each friend received\ncrackers_per_friend(InitialCrackers, FinalCrackers, CrackersPerFriend) :-\n    give_crackers(InitialCrackers, FinalCrackers, GivenCrackers),\n    CrackersPerFriend is GivenCrackers / 3.\n\n% Example query to find out how many crackers each friend received\n% Given initial crackers as 24 and final crackers as 17\n?- crackers_per_friend(24, 17, CrackersPerFriend).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a relationship between the initial and final cracker counts and calculates the number of crackers each friend received.
