After planting, the total number of trees increased to 21. The difference between the final and initial number of trees will give us the number of trees planted on that day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Initial number of trees**: 15 trees.\n2. **Final number of trees after planting**: 21 trees.\n3. **Calculation**: The number of trees planted is the difference between the final number of trees and the initial number of trees.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of trees planted based on the initial and final counts. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `plant_trees`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialTrees`, `FinalTrees`, and `PlantedTrees`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the difference between `FinalTrees` and `InitialTrees`, which gives `PlantedTrees`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of trees planted given the initial and final counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of trees planted\nplant_trees(InitialTrees, FinalTrees, PlantedTrees) :-\n    PlantedTrees is FinalTrees - InitialTrees.\n\n% Example query to find out how many trees were planted today\n% Given initial trees as 15 and final trees as 21\n?- plant_trees(15, 21, PlantedTrees).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the initial and final tree counts and computes the number of trees planted. The query provided will execute in a Prolog environment to yield the number of trees planted based on the given data."

We are given the information that Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. This means that the number of cups of flour she has already put in is related to the number of cups of sugar she will use.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up and solve a system of equations based on the given information:\n\n1. Let's represent the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in as 'F'.\n2. The number of cups of sugar she will use is 2 cups less than the number of cups of flour, so it can be represented as 'F - 2'.\n3. We know that the total amount of flour required is 11 cups, and this can be expressed as: F + (F - 2) = 11.\n4. Solving this equation, we can find the value of 'F', which represents the number of cups of flour Mary has already used.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining rules and relationships to model the given constraints.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we need to determine how much farther the mouse jumped compared to the grasshopper in a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches, and the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper. The mouse's jump is described as 16 inches less than the frog's jump. To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference in their jumping distances.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. Identify the grasshopper's jump: 14 inches.\n2. Calculate the frog's jump: It is 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 37 to 14.\n3. Determine the mouse's jump: It is 16 inches less than the frog's jump, so we subtract 16 from the frog's jump.\n4. Finally, find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper by subtracting the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining rules to calculate the jumping distances for each participant and then computing the final difference. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define Rules**:\n   - `frog_jump`: This rule calculates the frog's jump by adding 37 inches to the grasshopper's jump.\n   - `mouse_jump`: This rule calculates the mouse's jump by subtracting 16 inches from the frog's jump.\n   - `compare_jumps`: This rule calculates the difference between the mouse's and grasshopper's jumps.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) for addition and subtraction to calculate the jumps and differences.\n3. **Query**:\n   - Write a query that uses these rules to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rules for each participant's jump\nfrog_jump(GrasshopperJump, FrogJump) :-\n    FrogJump is GrasshopperJump + 37.\n\nmouse_jump(FrogJump, MouseJump) :-\n    MouseJump is FrogJump - 16.\n\n% Rule to compare the mouse's and grasshopper's jumps\ncompare_jumps(GrasshopperJump, MouseJump, Difference) :-\n    frog_jump(GrasshopperJump, FrogJump),\n    mouse_jump(FrogJump, MouseJump),\n    Difference is MouseJump - GrasshopperJump.\n\n% Example query to find out how much farther the mouse jumped\n?- compare_jumps(14, MouseJump, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships between the jumps of the grasshopper, frog, and mouse.

We need to calculate the total population of kids in Lawrence County.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of kids from Lawrence County who stayed home: 644,997.\n2. Identify the number of kids from Lawrence County who went to camp: 893,835.\n3. Recognize that the sum of these two numbers gives us the total population of kids in Lawrence County.\n4. Calculate the total population of kids in Lawrence County by adding the two numbers identified in steps 1 and 2.\n5. The number of kids from outside the county who attended the camp is additional information that doesn't directly influence the calculation of the total population of Lawrence County.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo approach this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total population of kids in Lawrence County based on the given information. Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `lawrence_county_kids` that accepts three parameters: `StayedHome`, `WentToCamp`, and `TotalKids`.\n2. **Calculate Total Population**: Inside the rule, calculate the total population of kids in Lawrence County by summing `StayedHome` and `WentToCamp`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of kids in Lawrence County. Provide the numbers of kids who stayed home and went to camp as input.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of kids in Lawrence County\nlawrence_county_kids(StayedHome, WentToCamp, TotalKids) :-\n    TotalKids is StayedHome + WentToCamp.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of kids in Lawrence County\n% Given the number of kids who stayed home and those who went to camp\n?- lawrence_county_kids(644997, 893835, TotalKids).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a straightforward relationship between the number of kids who stayed home and those who went to camp, and it computes the total population of kids in Lawrence County.

To find out how many more apps he deleted than he added, we need to calculate the difference between the number of apps added and the number of apps deleted.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of apps Dave had: 15 apps.\n2. Identify the number of new apps Dave added: 71 apps.\n3. Identify the number of apps Dave had left after deleting some: 14 apps.\n4. Calculate the number of apps Dave deleted: Final apps (14) minus initial apps (15) gives -1. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of deleting apps, so we assume he had 14 apps left after deleting some from the 86 apps (15 + 71) he had.\n5. Find the number of apps Dave deleted: Total apps (initial + added) minus final apps, or \\( (15 + 71) - 14 \\).\n6.

Define a rule `app_difference` that takes five variables: `InitialApps`, `AddedApps`, `FinalApps`, `DeletedApps`, and `Difference`.\n2. Calculate the total number of apps Dave had before deletion: `TotalApps` is the sum of `InitialApps` and `AddedApps`.\n3. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `DeletedApps` is the difference between `TotalApps` and `FinalApps`.\n4. The `Difference` is then calculated by subtracting `AddedApps` from `DeletedApps`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `Difference` given the initial number of apps, the number of apps added, and the final number of apps.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between added and deleted apps\napp_difference(InitialApps, AddedApps, FinalApps, DeletedApps, Difference) :-\n    TotalApps is InitialApps + AddedApps,\n    DeletedApps is TotalApps - FinalApps,\n    Difference is DeletedApps - AddedApps.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more apps Dave deleted than he added\n% Given initial apps as 15, added apps as 71, and final apps as 14\n?- app_difference(15, 71, 14, DeletedApps, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the difference between the number of apps added and deleted, taking into account the initial and final app counts.

It is found by subtracting `UsedSugar` from `RecipeSugar`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that employs this rule to determine the needed amount of sugar, given the recipe's requirements and Mary's progress.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the additional sugar needed\nadditional_sugar(RecipeSugar, UsedSugar, NeededSugar) :-\n    NeededSugar is RecipeSugar - UsedSugar.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary should add\n% Given the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and she has already used 10 cups\n?- additional_sugar(11, 10, NeededSugar).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the recipe's requirements and Mary's progress.

The Razorback t-shirt shop earns $106 for each t-shirt sold. By using the provided information, we can set up an equation to find the unknown number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the given values:\n   - Revenue per t-shirt: $106\n   - Total number of t-shirts sold during both games: 242\n   - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game: 115\n2. Set up the equation:\n   - Let the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game be represented by the variable 'x'.\n   - The total revenue from the Texas Tech game can be calculated as: $106 * x.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from both games:\n   - Add the revenue from the Arkansas game ($106 * 115) to the revenue from the Texas Tech game ($106 * x).\n4. Set up the equation based on the total revenue:\n   - The total revenue from both games should equal the total number of t-shirts sold times $106.\n   - Equation: ($106 * 115) + ($106 * x) = $106 * 242\n5.

Calculate the difference by subtracting the number of hours spent on Spanish from the number of hours spent on English.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference in hours between the two activities. Our plan includes the following steps:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `time_difference`**: Create a rule that takes three parameters - `EnglishHours`, `SpanishHours`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate Difference**: Inside the rule, use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to compute the difference between `EnglishHours` and `SpanishHours`, assigning the result to `Difference`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that utilizes this rule to find out the difference in hours Ryan spends on learning English compared to Spanish, given the respective hourly dedications.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in hours\ntime_difference(EnglishHours, SpanishHours, Difference) :-\n    Difference is EnglishHours - SpanishHours.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more hours Ryan spends on learning English\n% Given hours spent on English as 7 and hours spent on Spanish as 4\n?- time_difference(7, 4, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a straightforward relationship between Ryan's study hours for English and Spanish, and it computes the difference in hours. The provided query will yield the answer when executed in a Prolog environment.",

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `total_bananas`**: This rule will take three parameters - `GroupSize`, `NumberOfGroups`, and `TotalBananas`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Inside the rule, we will use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the total number of bananas by multiplying `GroupSize` and `NumberOfGroups`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find the total number of bananas in Philip's collection by providing the group size and the number of groups.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of bananas in Philip's collection\ntotal_bananas(GroupSize, NumberOfGroups, TotalBananas) :-\n    TotalBananas is GroupSize * NumberOfGroups.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of bananas in Philip's collection\n% Given group size as 187 and number of groups as 140\n?- total_bananas(187, 140, TotalBananas).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the group size, the number of groups, and the total number of bananas.

Calculate the total number of nails needed for all large planks: \\( 12 \\times 15 \\).\n4. Identify the number of small planks: 10 planks.\n5. Identify the number of nails needed for each small plank: 5 nails.\n6. Calculate the total number of nails needed for all small planks: \\( 10 \\times 5 \\).\n7. Add the total number of nails needed for large and small planks to find the overall requirement for the house walls.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the number of planks, the number of nails required for each type of plank, and the total number of nails needed. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_nails` that takes four variables: `LargePlanks`, `SmallPlanks`, `NailsPerLargePlank`, and `TotalNails`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: calculate the total number of nails needed for large planks and small planks separately.\n3. Sum up the total nails needed for both types of planks to find the overall requirement.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `TotalNails` given the number of large and small planks and the nails required for each type.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of nails needed for the house walls\ntotal_nails(LargePlanks, SmallPlanks, NailsPerLargePlank, NailsPerSmallPlank, TotalNails) :-\n    TotalLargeNails is LargePlanks * NailsPerLargePlank,\n    TotalSmallNails is SmallPlanks * NailsPerSmallPlank,\n    TotalNails is TotalLargeNails + TotalSmallNails.\n\n% Example query to find out how many nails John needs for the house walls\n% Given large planks as 12, small planks as 10, nails per large plank as 15, and nails per small plank as 5\n?- total_nails(12, 10, 15, 5, TotalNails).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the total number of nails required based on the given number of large and small planks and the nails needed for each type.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `price_difference` that takes two parameters: `TshirtProfit` and `JerseyProfit`.\n2. **Calculate Difference**: Inside the rule, directly calculate the difference between `TshirtProfit` and `JerseyProfit`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the price difference by providing the profit margins for t-shirts and jerseys.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the price difference between a t-shirt and a jersey\nprice_difference(TshirtProfit, JerseyProfit, Difference) :-\n    Difference is TshirtProfit - JerseyProfit.\n\n% Example query to find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey\n% Given profit per t-shirt as $192 and profit per jersey as $34\n?- price_difference(192, 34, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet directly computes the price difference by subtracting the profit of a jersey from the profit of a t-shirt.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThis problem involves calculating the amount of money Edward had before he spent $17 and received $10 from his friend. We know that Edward now has $7, and we need to determine his initial amount. To find this out, we can set up an equation where the initial amount, the spending, and the received amount relate to the current amount.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following arithmetic steps:\n\n1. **Given Information**: Edward spent $17 and received $10, and now he has $7.\n2. **Equation Setup**: Let's represent the unknown initial amount as 'I'. We can set up the equation: I - 17 + 10 = 7.\n3. **Solving**: Simplifying the equation, we get: I - 7 = 7. Combining like terms, we get: I = 14.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo create a SWI-Prolog code for this problem, we will define a rule that calculates the initial amount Edward had based on the given information. Here's how we can structure the code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `initial_amount` that takes two parameters: `SpentAmount` and `ReceivedAmount`. The rule will calculate the initial amount Edward had.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Within the rule, use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the initial amount. Subtract the spent amount from the sum of the received amount and the current amount.\n3. **Query**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out the initial amount Edward had, given the values of money he spent and received.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial amount Edward had\ninitial_amount(SpentAmount, ReceivedAmount, InitialAmount) :-\n    InitialAmount is ReceivedAmount + SpentAmount - 7.\n\n% Example query to find out how much Edward had before spending\n% Given that he spent $17 and received $10\n?- initial_amount(17, 10, InitialAmount).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a straightforward relationship between the values provided and calculates the initial amount Edward had.

The cake recipe requires a specific number of cups of sugar and flour: 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. However, she has already added 11 cups of flour. To determine how many more cups of sugar she needs in comparison to flour, we need to calculate the difference between the required and already added amounts for both ingredients.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a few simple arithmetic calculations:\n\n1.

Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `lost_given_crayons`**: This rule will take two arguments - `InitialCrayons` (the unknown initial quantity) and `RemainingCrayons` (the final quantity).\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the total number of crayons lost or given away by subtracting `RemainingCrayons` from `InitialCrayons`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query to find the value of `InitialCrayons` that satisfies the condition of having 492 crayons remaining after giving away 52 and losing 535.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of crayons lost or given away\nlost_given_crayons(InitialCrayons, RemainingCrayons) :-\n    LostGiven is InitialCrayons - RemainingCrayons.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of crayons lost or given away\n% Given remaining crayons as 492\n?- lost_given_crayons(InitialCrayons, 492), InitialCrayons >= 492, label(InitialCrayons).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule to calculate the number of crayons lost or given away. The query provided will find the value of `InitialCrayons` that satisfies the condition, ensuring it's greater than or equal to 492 (since we can't start with a negative number of crayons).

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `doug_lost_marbles`**: This rule will take four arguments - `InitialEdMarbles`, `InitialDougMarbles`, `FinalEdMarbles`, and `LostMarbles`.\n2. **Initial Difference**: Calculate the initial difference in marble counts between Ed and Doug as `InitialEdMarbles` minus `InitialDougMarbles`.\n3. **Final Difference**: Compute the final difference in marble counts after Doug's loss as `FinalEdMarbles` minus the unknown `FinalDougMarbles`.\n4. **Calculate Lost Marbles**: To find the number of marbles Doug lost, subtract the initial difference from the final difference.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to determine the number of marbles Doug lost, given the initial and final differences in marble counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of marbles Doug lost\ndoug_lost_marbles(InitialEdMarbles, InitialDougMarbles, FinalEdMarbles, LostMarbles) :-\n    % Calculate the initial difference in marble counts\n    InitialDifference is InitialEdMarbles - InitialDougMarbles,\n    % Calculate the final difference in marble counts\n    FinalDifference is FinalEdMarbles - (InitialDougMarbles - LostMarbles),\n    % Calculate the number of marbles Doug lost\n    LostMarbles is FinalDifference - InitialDifference.\n\n% Example query to find out how many marbles Doug lost\n% Given initial marble counts: Ed had 2 more than Doug\n% Final state: Ed has 19 more than Doug\n?- doug_lost_marbles(InitialEd, InitialDoug, FinalEd, Lost).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the number of marbles Doug lost.

The task is to find out his total earnings and then calculate how much money he will have left after paying rent for all those weeks.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using the following steps:\n\n1. **Total Earnings**: Calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the harvest season.\n2. **Total Rent Expenses**: Determine the total amount of money Lewis spends on rent during the same period by multiplying his weekly rent by the number of weeks.\n3. **Savings**: To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, subtract his total rent expenses from his total earnings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates Lewis's savings based on his earnings, the duration of the harvest season, and his weekly rent expenses. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `harvest_savings` that accepts four parameters: `WeeklyEarnings`, `Weeks`, `WeeklyRent`, and `TotalSavings`.\n2. **Calculate Total Earnings**: Inside the rule, calculate Lewis's total earnings during the harvest season by multiplying `WeeklyEarnings` by `Weeks`.\n3. **Calculate Total Rent Expenses**: Compute the total amount Lewis spends on rent by multiplying `WeeklyRent` by `Weeks`.\n4. **Calculate Savings**: Determine Lewis's savings by subtracting the total rent expenses from his total earnings.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out Lewis's savings during the harvest season based on the given data.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate Lewis's savings during the harvest season\nharvest_savings(WeeklyEarnings, Weeks, WeeklyRent, TotalSavings) :-\n    TotalEarnings is WeeklyEarnings * Weeks,\n    TotalRent is WeeklyRent * Weeks,\n    TotalSavings is TotalEarnings - TotalRent.\n\n% Example query to find out Lewis's savings at the end of the harvest season\n% Given weekly earnings as $491, weeks as 1181, and weekly rent as $216\n?- harvest_savings(491, 1181, 216, TotalSavings).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between Lewis's earnings, the duration of the harvest season, his rent expenses, and his savings.

Calculate the difference between the initial and final number of books to find out how many books were sold in the garage sale.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of books sold based on the initial and final counts. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `books_sold` that takes three parameters - `InitialBooks`, `FinalBooks`, and `BooksSold`.\n2. **Calculate Books Sold**: Inside the rule, use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate `BooksSold` as the difference between `InitialBooks` and `FinalBooks`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that utilizes this rule to find out the number of books sold. Provide the initial and final book counts as input.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of books sold\nbooks_sold(InitialBooks, FinalBooks, BooksSold) :-\n    BooksSold is InitialBooks - FinalBooks.\n\n% Example query to find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale\n% Given initial books as 108 and final books as 66\n?- books_sold(108, 66, BooksSold).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a straightforward relationship between the initial and final book counts, allowing us to compute the number of books sold.

Robin possesses 41 gum pieces in total, along with 6 extra individual pieces. To find out the quantity of packages, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each package and then account for the additional pieces.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using the following arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of gum pieces Robin has: 41 pieces.\n2. Determine the number of pieces in each package: 7 pieces per package.\n3.

The grasshopper jumped 25 inches, and the frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper. To find out how far the mouse jumped, which is 26 inches less than the frog's jump, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve for the mouse's jumping distance, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1.

The cave is 1218 feet deep, and the adventurers are currently at a depth of 849 feet. They are traveling at a speed of 17 feet per unit of measurement (presumably time). To find out how much farther they need to go, we need to calculate the difference between the total depth of the cave and their current depth, and then consider their speed.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using simple arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. Identify the total depth of the cave: 1218 feet.\n2. Identify the current depth of the adventurers: 849 feet.\n3.

We are given the total population of kids in the county and the number of kids who stay home during the break. To find out how many kids go to camp, we need to subtract the number of kids staying home from the total population.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using simple arithmetic operations:\n\n1. Identify the total population of kids in Lawrence County: 313,473 kids.\n2. Identify the number of kids who stay home during the summer break: 274,865 kids.\n3. Calculate the number of kids who go to camp by subtracting the number of kids who stay home from the total population.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that relates the total population, the number of kids staying home, and the number of kids going to camp.

        "question": "Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 18 bird families living near the mountain. If 38 bird families flew away to africa and 80 bird families flew away to asia, how many bird families flew away for the winter?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total number of bird families that migrated to warmer regions for the winter. Initially, there were 18 bird families living near the mountain. Two migrations occurred: one to Africa, involving 38 bird families, and another to Asia, involving 80 bird families. To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we need to sum up the counts from these two migrations.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we perform a straightforward arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Initial Bird Families**: There were 18 bird families near the mountain initially.\n2. **Migration to Africa**: 38 bird families flew away to Africa.\n3. **Migration to Asia**: 80 bird families flew away to Asia.\n4. **Total Bird Families Migrated**: To find the total number of bird families that migrated for the winter, we sum up the counts from the migrations to Africa and Asia.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total number of bird families that migrated based on the initial count and the counts from the two migrations. Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `total_migrated_birds` that accepts four parameters: `InitialBirds`, `AfricaBirds`, `AsiaBirds`, and `TotalMigratedBirds`.\n2. **Calculate Total Migrated Birds**: Inside the rule, directly sum up the counts from the migrations to Africa and Asia to derive the `TotalMigratedBirds`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of bird families that migrated for the winter. Provide the initial count and the counts from the migrations to Africa and Asia.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of bird families that migrated for the winter\ntotal_migrated_birds(InitialBirds, AfricaBirds, AsiaBirds, TotalMigratedBirds) :-\n    TotalMigratedBirds is AfricaBirds + AsiaBirds + InitialBirds.\n\n% Example query to find out how many bird families flew away for the winter\n% Given initial bird families as 18, bird families migrated to Africa as 38, and bird families migrated to Asia as 80\n?- total_migrated_birds(18, 38, 80, TotalMigratedBirds).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the total number of bird families that migrated.

The school has 67 classrooms, and each classroom accommodates 66 students. To ensure that all students can travel on the field trip, the school buses must be utilized efficiently. The challenge is to calculate the minimum number of buses needed, considering that each bus has a capacity of 6 seats.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Total Students**: First, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom.\n2. **Bus Capacity**: Each school bus has a capacity of 6 seats.\n3. **Calculate Number of Buses**: To find the minimum number of buses required, we need to divide the total number of students by the bus capacity. However, if the total number of students is not divisible by the bus capacity, we will need to account for any remaining students by adding an extra bus.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the minimum number of buses needed based on the total number of students and the bus capacity. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `calculate_buses` that accepts three parameters: `Classrooms`, `StudentsPerClassroom`, and `BusCapacity`.\n2. **Calculate Total Students**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of students in the school by multiplying `Classrooms` and `StudentsPerClassroom`.\n3. **Determine Number of Buses**: Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the minimum number of buses required by dividing the total number of students by the bus capacity. If there is a remainder, add 1 to ensure all students can be accommodated.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the minimum number of buses needed by providing the initial conditions (number of classrooms, students per classroom, and bus capacity).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the minimum number of buses needed for the field trip\ncalculate_buses(Classrooms, StudentsPerClassroom, BusCapacity, MinBuses) :-\n    TotalStudents is Classrooms * StudentsPerClassroom,\n    MinBuses is (TotalStudents // BusCapacity) + (TotalStudents mod BusCapacity > 0).\n\n% Example query to find out how many buses are needed for the field trip\n% Given 67 classrooms, 66 students per classroom, and a bus capacity of 6\n?- calculate_buses(67, 66, 6, MinBuses).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the minimum number of buses required.

To find the initial number of wrappers, subtract the newly found wrappers from the current total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the initial number of wrappers based on the current count and the number of new wrappers found. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `initial_wrappers` that takes three variables: `CurrentWrappers`, `NewWrappers`, and `InitialWrappers`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: The initial number of wrappers is the difference between the current count and the new wrappers found.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `InitialWrappers` given the current number of wrappers and the new wrappers found.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial number of wrappers Danny had\ninitial_wrappers(CurrentWrappers, NewWrappers, InitialWrappers) :-\n    InitialWrappers is CurrentWrappers - NewWrappers.\n\n% Example query to find out how many wrappers Danny had at first\n% Given current wrappers as 68 and new wrappers found as 66\n?- initial_wrappers(68, 66, InitialWrappers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the current and new wrapper counts to determine the initial number of wrappers.

Initially, Nell had 38 Ace cards and 239 baseball cards. Now, she has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many more Ace cards she has compared to baseball cards, we need to calculate the difference between the final counts of these two types of cards.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of Ace cards: 38.\n2. Identify the initial number of baseball cards: 239.\n3. Calculate the final number of Ace cards: 376.\n4.

Now, the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples remaining, and we know that Rachel picked 6 ripe apples.

Define a rule `compare_bird_families` that takes five variables: `InitialBirdFamilies`, `AfricaBirdFamilies`, `AsiaBirdFamilies`, `Difference`, and `ComparisonResult`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `Difference` is the result of subtracting `AsiaBirdFamilies` from `AfricaBirdFamilies`.\n3. Use conditional logic to determine the `ComparisonResult`: if `Difference` is greater than 0, then more bird families flew to Africa; if `Difference` is less than 0, then more families flew to Asia; if `Difference` is 0, then the same number flew to both destinations.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `ComparisonResult` given the initial bird families, the number of families that flew to Africa, and the number of families that flew to Asia.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to compare the number of bird families flying to Africa and Asia\ncompare_bird_families(InitialBirdFamilies, AfricaBirdFamilies, AsiaBirdFamilies, Difference, ComparisonResult) :-\n    Difference is AfricaBirdFamilies - AsiaBirdFamilies,\n    (Difference > 0 -> ComparisonResult = \"More families flew to Africa\";\n     Difference < 0 -> ComparisonResult = \"More families flew to Asia\";\n     Difference = 0 -> ComparisonResult = \"Equal number flew to both destinations\").\n\n% Example query to find out the comparison result\n% Given initial bird families as 8, families flew to Africa as 42, and families flew to Asia as 31\n?- compare_bird_families(8, 42, 31, Difference, ComparisonResult).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and compares the number of bird families flying to Africa and Asia.

        "question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, how many more cups of flour does she need to add?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves determining the additional amount of flour Mary needs to add to her cake batter. She has already put in an unknown number of cups of flour, and the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. The constraint given is that she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. We need to set up an equation to find out how many cups of flour she has already added and then calculate how many more cups she needs to add.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Known Quantities**:\n   - Flour required by the recipe: 6 cups.\n   - Sugar required by the recipe: 13 cups.\n   - Constraint: Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.\n2. **Unknown Quantity**:\n   - The number of cups of flour Mary has already added.\n3. **Equation Setup**:\n   - Let's assume Mary has already added 'x' cups of flour.\n   - According to the constraint, the number of cups of sugar added would be (x - 8) cups.\n   - Now, we can set up an equation:\n     ```\n     x + (x - 8) = 6\n     ```\n     This equation represents the total number of cups of flour Mary has added and the number of cups of sugar she has added, which should equal the total required by the recipe.\n4. **Solving for 'x'**:\n   - Solving the equation, we find:\n     ```\n     x + x - 8 = 6\n     2x - 8 = 6\n     2x = 6 + 8\n     2x = 14\n     x = 7\n     ```\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Mary has already added 7 cups of flour.\n   - To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we subtract the number of cups she has added from the total required:\n     ```\n     Cups of flour needed = 6 - 7 = -1\n     ```\n     So, she needs to add 1 less cup of flour, which means she has already added enough flour.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of cups of flour Mary has already added based on the given constraints. Then, we can determine if she needs to add more or has added enough. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `flour_cups`**: This rule will take two arguments - `FlourAdded` and `SugarAdded`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Calculate the number of cups of sugar added based on the constraint: `SugarAdded is FlourAdded - 8`.\n   - Set up the equation to find `FlourAdded`: `(FlourAdded + SugarAdded) = 6`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**:\n   - Write a query to find `FlourAdded` given the constraint and the total required by the recipe.\n   - Additionally, calculate if she needs to add more or has added enough.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of cups of flour Mary has added\nflour_cups(FlourAdded, SugarAdded) :-\n    SugarAdded is FlourAdded - 8,\n    FlourAdded + SugarAdded = 6.\n\n% Example query to find out how many cups of flour Mary has already added\n% and if she needs to add more or has added enough\n?- flour_cups(FlourAdded, SugarAdded).\n\n% Query to determine if she needs to add more or has added enough\n?- flour_cups(FlourAdded, SugarAdded),\n    (FlourAdded >= 6 -> write(\"Mary has added enough flour.\") ; write(\"Mary needs to add more flour.\")).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and constraints, and it will help determine how many cups of flour Mary has added and whether she needs to add more or has added enough.

Then, 44 more girls joined the school. To find out the new total number of girls, we need to simply add the number of new girls to the initial count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using basic arithmetic operations:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of girls in the school: 902 girls.\n2. Identify the number of new girls who joined: 44 girls.\n3. Add the number of new girls to the initial count to determine the updated total number of girls.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the new total number of girls by adding the initial count and the number of new girls. Here's a structured plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_girls` that takes three parameters: `InitialGirls`, `NewGirls`, and `FinalGirls`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `FinalGirls` is the sum of `InitialGirls` and `NewGirls`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find `FinalGirls` given the initial number of girls and the number of new girls.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of girls in the school\ntotal_girls(InitialGirls, NewGirls, FinalGirls) :-\n    FinalGirls is InitialGirls + NewGirls.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of girls in the school now\n% Given initial girls as 902 and new girls as 44\n?- total_girls(902, 44, FinalGirls).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial count of girls, the number of new girls, and the final total.

We are given that Jesse's room is 7 feet long, and she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet. To find the width of the room, we need to calculate it based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using the concept of area. Here are the steps to find the solution:\n\n1. Understand the Given Information: We know the length of Jesse's room (7 feet) and the required carpet size (14 square feet).\n2. Calculate the Width: To find the width of the room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: \n   - Length \u00d7 Width = Area\n3. Rearrange the Formula: We can rearrange the formula to solve for the width: \n   - Width = Area / Length\n4. Plug in the Values: \n   - Width = 14 square feet / 7 feet\n5. Calculate the Width: Perform the calculation to find the width of Jesse's room.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the width of the room based on the length and the required carpet size.

This rule will be true if `RemainingBooks` is greater than `RemainingMovies`.\n4. **Query**:\n   - Write a query to find out how many more books there are than movies by providing the initial quantities and actions taken.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the remaining number of books\nremaining_books(TotalBooks, BooksRead, RemainingBooks) :-\n    RemainingBooks is TotalBooks - BooksRead.\n\n% Calculate the remaining number of movies\nremaining_movies(TotalMovies, MoviesWatched, RemainingMovies) :-\n    RemainingMovies is TotalMovies - MoviesWatched.\n\n% Compare the remaining books and movies\nmore_books_than_movies(RemainingBooks, RemainingMovies) :-\n    RemainingBooks > RemainingMovies.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more books there are than movies\n% Given total books, total movies, books read, and movies watched\n?- remaining_books(15, 11, RemainingBooks),\n   remaining_movies(14, 40, RemainingMovies),\n   more_books_than_movies(RemainingBooks, RemainingMovies).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships between the quantities and uses arithmetic operations to calculate the remaining books and movies. The final query will determine if there are more books than movies in the 'Crazy Silly School' series.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of green peaches in each basket given that there are a total of 12 peaches across two baskets, and each basket contains 4 red peaches. To solve this, we need to determine how many peaches in each basket are not red, i.e., they are green. This will help us find out the number of green peaches in each basket.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1. **Total Peaches**: There are a total of 12 peaches across the two baskets.\n2. **Red Peaches**: Each basket contains 4 red peaches, so the total number of red peaches is \\( 2 \\times 4 \\) = 8 red peaches.\n3. **Green Peaches**: The remaining peaches are green. To find the number of green peaches in each basket, we subtract the number of red peaches from half of the total peaches (since there are two baskets).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of green peaches in each basket based on the given constraints. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `green_peaches_per_basket` that takes three parameters: `TotalPeaches`, `RedPeachesPerBasket`, and `GreenPeachesPerBasket`.\n2. **Calculate Total Red Peaches**: Multiply the number of `RedPeachesPerBasket` by the number of baskets to get the total number of red peaches.\n3. **Calculate Green Peaches per Basket**: Subtract the total number of red peaches from half of the `TotalPeaches` to find the number of green peaches in each basket.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the number of green peaches per basket given the total number of peaches and the number of red peaches per basket.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of green peaches in each basket\ngreen_peaches_per_basket(TotalPeaches, RedPeachesPerBasket, GreenPeachesPerBasket) :-\n    TotalRedPeaches is RedPeachesPerBasket * 2,\n    GreenPeachesPerBasket is (TotalPeaches // 2) - (TotalRedPeaches // 2).\n\n% Example query to find out the number of green peaches in each basket\n% Given total peaches as 12 and red peaches per basket as 4\n?- green_peaches_per_basket(12, 4, GreenPeachesPerBasket).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the total number of peaches, the number of red peaches per basket, and the number of green peaches per basket.
