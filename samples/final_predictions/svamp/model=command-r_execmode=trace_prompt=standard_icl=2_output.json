She initially had $3 in her wallet and collected additional money from the ATM. After her visit to the supermarket, she had $49 left. We must calculate this difference to find the amount she collected from the ATM.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into simpler steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount of money Olivia had: $3.\n2. Determine the amount of money she collected from the ATM: this value should be greater than the initial amount in the wallet.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Olivia had after visiting the ATM: the sum of the initial amount and the money collected from the ATM.\n4. Subtract the amount spent at the supermarket from the total amount post-ATM visit to find the remaining money.\n5. The amount collected from the ATM is the difference between the total post-ATM and the amount spent at the supermarket.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll define a Prolog rule that computes the difference between the money collected from the ATM and the money spent at the supermarket. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `atm_difference` that takes four variables: `InitialMoney`, `ATMMoney`, `SupermarketSpend`, and `Difference`.\n2. Calculate the total money after the ATM visit: `TotalMoney` is the sum of `InitialMoney` and `ATMMoney`.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMary's cake recipe requires specific quantities of flour and sugar to be mixed in certain proportions. She has already put in some cups of flour, and the task is to determine how many cups of flour she has added, knowing that she still needs to add twice the amount of sugar left. We need to calculate the initial quantity of flour added by Mary.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Identify the known quantities: We have the recipe's requirements - 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar.\n2. Determine the current state: Mary has already put in some cups of flour. We'll represent this as `CurrentFlour`.\n3. Establish the relationship between flour and sugar: The problem states that Mary needs to add 2 more cups of flour than sugar. We'll represent the cups of sugar left as `SugarLeft`.\n4. Calculate the initial quantity of flour: Since we have a relationship between flour and sugar, we can determine the flour already added based on the sugar left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will construct a rule that computes the initial quantity of flour based on the recipe requirements and the current state of the flour addition process. Here's the planned Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a Rule: Create a rule `baking_cake` that accepts the recipe's requirements (`RecipeFlour` and `RecipeSugar`) and the current flour addition quantity (`CurrentFlour`).\n2. Establish the Relationship: Use the given information that Mary needs to add 2 more cups of flour than sugar left. Create a variable `SugarLeft` to represent the sugar still needed.\n3. Calculate Initial Flour: Determine the initial quantity of flour added by subtracting the sugar left from the current flour addition.\n4. Query Prolog: Use Prolog's query system to find out the initial quantity of flour by providing the recipe requirements and the current flour state.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial cups of flour added by Mary\nbaking_cake(RecipeFlour, RecipeSugar, CurrentFlour, InitialFlour) :-\n    SugarLeft is CurrentFlour - 2,\n    InitialFlour is CurrentFlour - SugarLeft.\n\n% Example query to find the initial cups of flour\n% Based on a recipe requiring 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar,\n% and Mary currently having 13 cups of flour added\n?- baking_cake(11, 7, 13, InitialFlour).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationship between the recipe requirements, the current state, and the initial flour addition.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper in the jumping contest. We have the jumping distance of the grasshopper (14 inches). The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. We can find the distance the frog jumped by adding 37 inches to the grasshopper's jump. Then, we subtract this distance from the mouse's jump to determine the required difference.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. Identify the jump distance of the grasshopper: 14 inches.\n2. Calculate the jump distance of the frog by adding the difference to the grasshopper's jump: \\( 14 + 37 \\).\n3. Identify the jump distance of the mouse: We don't have this information directly, but we know it's 16 inches lesser than the frog's jump. We can express this as a mathematical relationship.\n4. Subtract the frog's jump distance from the mouse's jump distance to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll define a rule in SWI-Prolog that captures the relationships between the different jumping distances. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `jumping_contest` with variables for the grasshopper's jump (`GrasshopperJump`), the frog's jump (`FrogJump`), and the mouse's jump (`MouseJump`).\n2.

Determine the capacity of the machine in terms of shirts per minute: 8 shirts/minute.\n4. Calculate the total number of shirts produced.\n5. Divide the total number of shirts by the capacity to find the total time in minutes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we'll define a rule that captures the relationship between the number of shirts produced on two different days and the machine's production rate. Here's the step-by-step plan for constructing the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_work_minutes` with four variables: `YesterdaysShirts`, `TodaysShirts`, `ShirtsPerMinute`, and `TotalMinutes`.\n2. Calculate the overall number of shirts produced by summing `YesterdaysShirts` and `TodaysShirts`.\n3. Divide the total number of shirts by the `ShirtsPerMinute` to find the total time in minutes.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find `TotalMinutes` based on the given shirt counts and production rate.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total minutes the machine worked\ncalculate_work_minutes(YesterdaysShirts, TodaysShirts, ShirtsPerMinute, TotalMinutes) :-\n    TotalShirts is YesterdaysShirts + TodaysShirts,\n    TotalMinutes is TotalShirts / ShirtsPerMinute.\n\n% Example query to find the total minutes the machine worked\n% Based on 13 shirts made yesterday, 3 shirts today, and a rate of 8 shirts/minute\n?- calculate_work_minutes(13, 3, 8, TotalMinutes).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the number of shirts and the machine's rate to compute the total work time.

The number of families that flew away can be found by subtracting `RemainingFamilies` from `InitialFamilies`.\n3. To account for the fact that both departing and remaining families are counted twice in the initial total, we'll add this difference twice to get the final answer.\n4.

The information we have is based on two consecutive days. On the first day, there were 188 visitors, while on the second day (the current day), the palace welcomed 557 visitors. To find the total number of visitors within 57 days, we'll have to consider these two days and then make a calculation based on this information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into simpler steps:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking throughout the day. In the morning, 41 campers went rowing, and 4 campers went hiking. In the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing. The task is to calculate the total number of campers who participated in both activities.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break down the problem into several steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of campers who went rowing in the morning: 41 campers.\n2. Identify the number of campers who went hiking in the morning: 4 campers.\n3. Add these together to find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning.\n4. Determine the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon: 26 campers.\n5. Since those who went hiking in the morning likely also went rowing (overlapping sets), we need to subtract these campers from the afternoon rowing group.\n6. Add the result to the total number of campers from the morning to get the final count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the final number of campers who went rowing and hiking based on the morning and afternoon activities. Here's the planned Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `campers_activity_count` with four variables: `MorningRowing`, `MorningHiking`, `AfternoonRowing`, and `TotalCampers`.\n2. Calculate the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning by adding `MorningRowing` and `MorningHiking`.\n3. Subtract the number of campers who went hiking in the morning from the afternoon rowing count to find the number of campers who went rowing only in the afternoon.\n4. Add this count to the morning's total campers who went rowing and hiking to determine the final total.\n5. Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the solution by providing the activity counts for the morning and afternoon.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking\ncampers_activity_count(MorningRowing, MorningHiking, AfternoonRowing, TotalCampers) :-\n    MorningTotal is MorningRowing + MorningHiking,\n    AfternoonOnly is AfternoonRowing - MorningHiking,\n    TotalCampers is MorningTotal + AfternoonOnly.\n\n% Example query to find the total campers who went rowing and hiking\n% Based on the given activity counts\n?- campers_activity_count(41, 4, 26, TotalCampers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the logical relationship between the activity counts and computes the final result.

Zachary did 19 push-ups, David did 39 more than Zachary, and John did 13 fewer push-ups than David.

        "question": "Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, 6 emails in the morning and some more in the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day, how many emails did jack receive in the evening?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the number of emails Jack received in the evening. We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 in the morning, making a total of 9 emails. Since he received a total of 10 emails throughout the day, the remaining emails must have been received in the evening.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe logic is straightforward. We need to subtract the total number of emails Jack received in the afternoon and morning from the overall total to find the number of emails received in the evening.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that captures the relationship between the total number of emails received in the morning and afternoon, and the number received during the entire day. From this, we can find the number of emails Jack received in the evening. Here's the step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `emails_evening` with four variables: `MorningEmails`, `AfternoonEmails`, `TotalEmails`, and `EveningEmails`.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the sum of emails received in the morning and afternoon (`TotalKnownEmails`).\n3. Subtract the total number of known emails (`TotalKnownEmails`) from the overall total number of emails (`TotalEmails`) to find the number of emails received in the evening.\n4. Use a Prolog query to solve for `EveningEmails` by providing the known counts for morning and afternoon emails, and the overall total.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of emails received in the evening\nemails_evening(MorningEmails, AfternoonEmails, TotalEmails, EveningEmails) :-\n    TotalKnownEmails is MorningEmails + AfternoonEmails,\n    EveningEmails is TotalEmails - TotalKnownEmails.\n\n% Example query to find the number of emails received in the evening\n% When 6 emails were received in the morning, 3 in the afternoon, and a total of 10 during the day\n?- emails_evening(6, 3, 10, EveningEmails).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationship between the known and unknown email counts and uses simple arithmetic to find the solution.

We need to determine the difference between the number of bottle caps he found in the park and the number he threw away. Initially, Danny had some bottle caps in his collection, and after his park visit and cleanup, the number changed. We'll calculate this difference to find the answer.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem and analyze the steps needed to find the solution:\n\n1. **Initial Collection**: Danny had some bottle caps in his collection before his park visit. We'll denote this as `InitialCaps`.\n2. **Bottle Caps Found**: He found additional bottle caps at the park, which we'll represent as `FoundCaps`.\n3. **Bottle Caps Thrown**: Some old bottle caps were thrown away, and their count is denoted as `ThrownCaps`.\n4. **Final Collection**: After the additions and subtractions, Danny's final count of bottle caps in his collection is `FinalCaps`.\n5. **Difference**: The number of bottle caps Danny found in the park more than those he threw away is the difference between `FoundCaps` and `ThrownCaps`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to organize and compute this information. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a Prolog rule `bottle_caps` with four arguments: `InitialCaps`, `FoundCaps`, `ThrownCaps`, and `FinalCaps`.\n2. The relationship between these variables can be expressed using simple arithmetic. The final number of bottle caps is obtained by adding the bottle caps found in the park and the initial collection, and then subtracting the number of caps thrown away.\n3.

The number of oranges harvested daily will be calculated by multiplying `DailySacks` and `SackOranges`.\n4. To find the number of days, we need to divide the `TargetSacks` by the daily harvest of oranges.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for the number of days given the daily sack rate and target sacks.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of days needed to harvest\ndays_to_harvest(DailySacks, SackOranges, TargetSacks, Days) :-\n    DailyOranges is DailySacks * SackOranges,\n    Days is TargetSacks / DailyOranges.\n\n% Example query to find the number of days required to harvest 80 sacks\n% With a daily harvest of 16 sacks (each containing 57 oranges)\n?- days_to_harvest(16, 57, 80, Days).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a direct relationship between the daily harvest rate and the number of days required to reach the target harvest.

We are given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches and that its jump was 4 inches farther than the frog's. Additionally, we know that the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. We can use these relationships to calculate the frog's jumping distance.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, which is 4 inches more than the frog's jump. We can represent the frog's jump as `FrogJump`.\n2. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, which means `FrogJump` plus 44 inches equals the mouse's jump.\n3. We need to find `FrogJump` which remains as the constant in these relationships.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be constructed to represent these relationships and solve for the frog's jump distance (`FrogJump`). Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `jumping_contest` with three variables: `GrasshopperJump`, `FrogJump`, and `MouseJump`.\n2. Express the relationship between `GrasshopperJump` and `FrogJump`: `GrasshopperJump` is 4 inches more than `FrogJump`.\n3. Express the relationship between `FrogJump` and `MouseJump`: `MouseJump` is 44 inches less than `FrogJump`.\n4. Use SWI Prolog's logic and arithmetic capabilities to solve for `FrogJump`.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the frog's jump distance\njumping_contest(GrasshopperJump, FrogJump, MouseJump) :-\n    FrogJump is GrasshopperJump - 4,\n    MouseJump is FrogJump + 44.\n\n% Example query to find the frog's jump distance\n% Given the grasshopper's jump as 19 inches and the mouse's jump as a variable X\n?- jumping_contest(19, FrogJump, X), X = 49.\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationships and allows us to query the unknown `FrogJump` using SWI-Prolog's inference capabilities.

The initial number of apples on one tree has no direct relation to the total number of trees (Rachel has 52 trees), so we focus on finding the initial number of apples on one tree.\n3. Subtract the number of apples picked from the total remaining number to find the initial count.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's querying features to find the `InitialApples` with the given remaining apples and the number picked.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial number of apples on the tree\ninitial_apples(PickNumber, RemainingApples, InitialApples) :-\n    InitialApples is RemainingApples + PickNumber.\n\n% Example query to find the initial number of apples\n% Given remaining apples as 7 and apples picked as 2\n?- initial_apples(2, 7, InitialApples).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a straightforward relationship to compute the initial number of apples based on the given information.

Determine the number of unsold cakes by subtracting the sold cakes from the initially made cakes: \\( 19 - 70 \\).\n4. Determine the number of unsold pastries by subtracting the sold pastries from the initially made pastries: \\( 131 - 88 \\).\n5. Subtract the number of unsold cakes from the number of unsold pastries to find the difference in favor of pastries.\n\n### Plan:\n\nFor the SWI-Prolog code, we'll define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of pastries and cakes. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `pastry_cake_difference` with four variables: `MadeCakes`, `MadePastry`, `SoldCakes`, and `SoldPastry`.\n2. Subtract `SoldCakes` from `MadeCakes` to find the number of unsold cakes.\n3. Subtract `SoldPastry` from `MadePastry` to find the number of unsold pastries.\n4. Subtract the number of unsold cakes from the number of unsold pastries to obtain the difference.\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine how many more peaches Jill has than Jake. To solve this, we must first establish the number of peaches Jake has, which is 16 fewer than Steven's peaches. Steven, in turn, has 15 more peaches than Jill. By determining the difference in the number of peaches between Jill and Jake, we can find the answer.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into simpler steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of peaches Jill has: 12 peaches.\n2. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, so we can calculate Steven's peaches as \\( 12 + 15 \\).\n3. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can find Jake's peaches by subtracting 16 from Steven's total.\n4. Finally, we subtract Jake's peaches from Jill's peaches to determine the difference, which represents the number of more peaches Jill has than Jake.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will define a Prolog rule that calculates the difference in the number of peaches between Jill and Jake based on the given relationships. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `peach_difference` that takes four variables: `JillPeaches`, `StevenMoreThanJill`, `JakeFewerThanSteven`, and `Difference`.\n2. Calculate Steven's peaches by adding `JillPeaches` and `StevenMoreThanJill`.\n3. Calculate Jake's peaches by subtracting `JakeFewerThanSteven` from Steven's total.\n4.

        "question": "Edward spent $ 9. Then he spent $ 8 more. Now he has $ 17. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine how much money Edward had before he spent some. After spending $9, Edward had $17 left. Then he spent $8 more, which means he now has $17 - $8 = $9 left. The total amount he spent is the difference between his initial money and the current amount in his possession.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break down the problem into basic arithmetic operations:\n\n1. Identify the amount Edward has left after the first spending: $17.\n2. Identify the amount spent during the second spending: $8.\n3. Subtract the current amount from the amount spent to determine the initial amount of money: \\( 9 + x \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that represents the relationship between Edward's initial money, the amount spent twice, and the remaining money. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `edwards_money` with four variables: `InitialMoney`, `FirstSpending`, `SecondSpending`, and `RemainingMoney`.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to express the relationship between these variables. The total spending is the sum of `FirstSpending` and `SecondSpending`. The initial money is then equivalent to the total spending plus the remaining money.\n3.

Identify the initial number of roses: 21 roses.\n2. Identify the number of roses left after throwing some away: half of 21, or 10.5 roses (we will need to round this value).\n3. Identify the current number of roses in the vase: 15 roses.\n4. Calculate the number of roses thrown away by subtracting the post-throwaway number from the current number: \\( 15 - 10.5 \\). \n5. Subtract the number of roses cut from the garden from this value to find the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThis problem can be solved using SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that considers the initial number of roses, the number of roses thrown away, and the number cut from the garden. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `rose_difference` that takes four variables: `InitialRoses`, `ThrownAwayRoses`, `GardenRoses`, and `Difference`.\n2. Calculate the number of roses remaining after throwing some away by dividing the initial number by 2 (using the `//` integer division operator).\n3. Compute the difference between the current number of roses and the number remaining after throwing some away.\n4. Subtract the number of roses cut from the garden from this difference to find the final result.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find the answer by providing the initial number of roses and the number of roses currently in the vase.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between roses thrown away and roses cut from the garden\nrose_difference(InitialRoses, ThrownAwayRoses, GardenRoses, Difference) :-\n    RosesAfterThrowing is InitialRoses // 2,\n    DifferenceBetweenOperations is ThrownAwayRoses - RosesAfterThrowing,\n    Difference is DifferenceBetweenOperations - GardenRoses.\n\n% Query to find the difference between the roses thrown away and those cut from the garden\n% With the initial number of roses as 21 and the current number as 15\n?- rose_difference(21, ThrownAwayRoses, 0, Difference).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationship between the number of roses and the operations performed, and the query at the end retrieves the desired answer.",

Subtract this difference from David's total to find Zachary's total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog to solve this problem efficiently involves structuring a rule with the right variables and constraints. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Design a rule named `more_pushups` with three variables: `DavidPushups` for the number David did, `ZacharyPushups` for Zachary's count, and `Diff` for the difference between their counts.\n2. The difference between their push-ups is expressed as a fact in the rule.\n3. Subtract this difference from David's push-ups to solve for Zachary's count.\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's querying features to find the solution by providing David's known push-up count.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to find Zachary's push-ups\nmore_pushups(DavidPushups, ZacharyPushups, Diff) :-\n    Diff is DavidPushups - ZacharyPushups.\n\n% Query to find Zachary's push-ups when David did 37 push-ups\n?- more_pushups(37, ZacharyPushups, 30).\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationship between David and Zachary's push-up counts and allows us to find the answer using SWI-Prolog's query functionality.",

We need to calculate the remaining number of tomatoes by subtracting the picked tomatoes from the initial total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the number of tomatoes left based on the initial counts of green and red tomatoes and the number of tomatoes picked. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `tomatoes_left` with four variables: `GreenTomatoes`, `RedTomatoes`, `PickedTomatoes`, and `LeftTomatoes`.\n2. Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the initial total number of tomatoes as the sum of `GreenTomatoes` and `RedTomatoes`.\n3. The number of left tomatoes is then found by subtracting `PickedTomatoes` from the initial total.\n4. Use a Prolog query to solve for `LeftTomatoes` using the defined rule, given the initial counts of green and red tomatoes, and the number of picked tomatoes.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of tomatoes left\ntomatoes_left(GreenTomatoes, RedTomatoes, PickedTomatoes, LeftTomatoes) :-\n    InitialTotal is GreenTomatoes + RedTomatoes,\n    LeftTomatoes is InitialTotal - PickedTomatoes.\n\n% Example query to find the remaining tomatoes\n% Given green tomatoes as 105, red tomatoes as 71, and picked tomatoes as 137\n?- tomatoes_left(105, 71, 137, LeftTomatoes).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the initial counts and the number of picked tomatoes to compute the final answer.

Use arithmetic operations to calculate the total gum pieces by multiplying `GumPackages` and `PiecesPerPackage`.\n3. Similarly, calculate the total candy pieces by multiplying `CandyPackages` and `PiecesPerPackage`.\n4. Compute the overall total pieces by summing up the gum pieces and candy pieces.\n5. Use a Prolog query to solve for `TotalPieces` using the defined rule, given the number of gum packages, candy packages, and pieces per package.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of pieces Robin has\nrobin_packages(GumPackages, PiecesPerPackage, CandyPackages, TotalPieces) :-\n    GumPieces is GumPackages * PiecesPerPackage,\n    CandyPieces is CandyPackages * PiecesPerPackage,\n    TotalPieces is GumPieces + CandyPieces.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of pieces Robin has\n?- robin_packages(28, 6, 14, TotalPieces).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the number of packages, pieces per package, and the total number of pieces.

        "question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMary's cake recipe requires her to add a specific amount of flour and sugar. She has already added 4 cups of sugar, but now she needs to determine how many more cups of flour she needs to add compared to the sugar. This problem can be solved by finding the difference between the required amounts of flour and sugar.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the answer, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. **Required Sugar**: The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar.\n2. **Partial Sugar Addition**: Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar.\n3. **Required Additional Sugar**: The difference between the recipe's requirement and Mary's partial addition.\n4. **Required Flour**: The recipe specifies 9 cups of flour.\n5. **Difference in Required Flour and Sugar**: Calculate the difference between the required amounts of flour and the additional sugar needed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that computes the differences in required flour and sugar amounts. Here's the planned Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define Rule `baking_cake`**: This rule will accept four parameters: `requiredSugar`, `addedSugar`, `requiredFlour`, and `flourSugarDifference`.\n2. **Calculate Additional Sugar**: Compute the additional sugar needed by subtracting the added sugar from the required sugar amount.\n3. **Calculate Flour Difference**: Find the difference between the required flour and the sugar difference just calculated. This gives us the disparity between the required cups of flour and sugar from here on.\n4. **Query in Prolog**: Use a Prolog query to invoke our rule with the known values from the recipe and Mary's partial addition.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in required flour and sugar\nbaking_cake(RequiredSugar, AddedSugar, RequiredFlour, FlourSugarDifference) :-\n    AdditionalSugar is RequiredSugar - AddedSugar,\n    FlourSugarDifference is RequiredFlour - AdditionalSugar.\n\n% Example query to find the difference between required flour and sugar\n% Given required sugar as 6 cups, added sugar as 4 cups, and required flour as 9 cups\n?- baking_cake(6, 4, 9, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the logic of the baking scenario and can compute the exact difference between the required flour and sugar additions.

This can be found by dividing the total willing students by the bus seat capacity and potentially adding 1 if the remainder is greater than 0.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the required number of buses based on the given parameters. Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `school_trip` that takes in the number of classrooms, total students, students who don't want to go, seats per bus, and returns the required number of buses.\n2. **Calculate Willing Students**: Subtract the students who don't want to go from the total students to find the number of students who wish to go on the trip.\n3. **Calculate Bus Requirement**: Use Prolog's division (`//`) and modulo (`mod`) operators to divide the willing students by the number of seats per bus. We'll add 1 to the result if the remainder is greater than 0.\n4. **Querying Prolog**: Use a query to find the answer by providing the relevant input parameters.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of buses required for the field trip\nschool_trip(Classrooms, TotalStudents, OptOutStudents, SeatsPerBus, RequiredBuses) :-\n    % Calculate the number of students who want to go on the trip\n    WillingStudents is TotalStudents - OptOutStudents,\n    % Calculate how many buses are needed\n    RequiredBuses is (WillingStudents + SeatsPerBus - 1) // SeatsPerBus.\n\n% Example query to find the required number of buses for the field trip\n% Given 66 classrooms, 102 students, 22 opt-outs, and 8 seats per bus\n?- school_trip(66, 102, 22, 8, RequiredBuses).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the logic to determine the necessary number of buses for the school trip.

Each seat can hold 9 people, and simultaneously, 18 people can ride the wheel. We'll need to divide and then find the whole to determine the number of seats.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. Identify the capacity of each seat: Each seat can hold 9 people.\n2. Identify the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously: 18 people.\n3. Calculate the number of seats by dividing the total capacity by the capacity of each seat.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog to solve this problem, we'll define a rule that captures the relationship between the capacity of each seat, the total simultaneous capacity, and the number of seats on the Ferris wheel. Here's the step-by-step plan to create the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `ferris_wheel_seats` that takes three variables: `CapacityPerSeat`, `TotalCapacity`, and `NumberOfSeats`.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to express the relationship between these variables. The number of seats is the total capacity divided by the capacity per seat.\n3.

Here's a detailed plan for constructing the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule named `initial_apps` that accepts four variables: `AppsRemaining`, `AppsDeleted`, and `InitialApps`.\n2. Establish the relationship between these variables using basic arithmetic: the initial number of apps is the sum of `AppsRemaining` and `AppsDeleted`.\n3.

        "question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the total number of flowers grown from the seeds planted in the flower beds. Paige and her mom planted an equal number of seeds in each flower bed, and the number of seeds that grew into flowers is also constant for each bed. The solution involves calculating the number of seeds planted and then finding out how many of them grew into flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of seeds planted in each flower bed: 15 seeds.\n2. Identify the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed: 60 seeds.\n3. Calculate the total number of seeds planted by multiplying the seeds per bed by the number of flower beds.\n4. Since only 60 seeds grew in each bed, find the total number of flowers by dividing the number of seeds that grew by the number of seeds per bed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will define a rule in SWI-Prolog that captures the constant relationship between these variables. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `flower_count` with four variables: `SeedsPerBed`, `SeedsGrown`, `TotalSeedsPlanted`, and `TotalFlowers`.\n2. Calculate `TotalSeedsPlanted` by multiplying `SeedsPerBed` by an unknown number of flower beds.\n3. Calculate `TotalFlowers` by dividing `SeedsGrown` by `SeedsPerBed`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find the unknown number of flower beds and thereby the total number of flowers.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of flowers\nflower_count(SeedsPerBed, SeedsGrown, TotalFlowers) :-\n    TotalSeedsPlanted is SeedsPerBed * Beds,\n    TotalFlowers is SeedsGrown // SeedsPerBed,\n    Beds = TotalSeedsPlanted // SeedsPerBed.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of flowers\n?- flower_count(15, 60, TotalFlowers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up the relationships and queries for the unknown number of flower beds to calculate the total number of flowers grown.

        "question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMary needs to determine how many more cups of sugar she needs to add to complete the cake recipe. She already has added 4 cups of sugar, but the recipe requires 7 cups in total. We need to find the difference between the desired amount of sugar and the amount she has already added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break down this problem into logical steps as follows:\n\n1. Identify the amount of sugar Mary has already added: 4 cups of sugar.\n2. Identify the total amount of sugar required according to the recipe: 7 cups of sugar.\n3. Subtract the amount already added from the desired amount to find out how many more cups of sugar are needed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll define a rule in SWI-Prolog that calculates the additional cups of sugar needed. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `additional_sugar` that takes three variables: `AddedSugar`, `TotalSugar`, and `NeededSugar`.\n2. The value of `NeededSugar` should be the difference between `TotalSugar` and `AddedSugar`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's querying features to find out the value of `NeededSugar` when we know the sugar already added and the total sugar required.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate how many more cups of sugar are needed\nadditional_sugar(AddedSugar, TotalSugar, NeededSugar) :-\n    NeededSugar is TotalSugar - AddedSugar.\n\n% Example query to find the additional sugar needed\n% When 4 cups of sugar have been added, and the recipe requires 7 cups in total\n?- additional_sugar(4, 7, NeededSugar).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a relationship between the sugar already added, the total sugar needed, and the remaining sugar to be added.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine how far the frog jumped in the jumping contest. We are given that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches and that the grasshopper's jump was two inches farther than the frog's jump. We can find the frog's jump distance by subtracting two inches from the grasshopper's jump.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem requires a straightforward arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. Identify the distance the grasshopper jumped: 13 inches.\n2. Understand that the grasshopper's jump is two inches more than the frog's jump: \\( 13 - 2 \\).\n3. Subtract this difference from the grasshopper's jump distance to find the frog's jump.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will follow a similar structure to the previous examples. We'll define a rule that calculates the frog's jump distance based on the given grasshopper's jump. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `frog_jump` that takes two variables: `GrasshopperJump` and `FrogJump`.\n2. Subtract two inches from the `GrasshopperJump` to find the `FrogJump`.\n3.
