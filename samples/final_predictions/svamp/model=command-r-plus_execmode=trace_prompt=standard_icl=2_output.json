On Tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls, and on Wednesday, he lost an additional 2 golf balls. To find out the total number of golf balls Michael has at the end of Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of golf balls lost from the initial count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of golf balls: 58 golf balls.\n2. Identify the number of golf balls lost on Tuesday: 23 golf balls.\n3. Identify the number of golf balls lost on Wednesday: 2 golf balls.\n4. Calculate the total number of golf balls lost over the two days: \\( 23 + 2 \\).\n5. Subtract the total number of golf balls lost from the initial number of golf balls to find the final count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial number of golf balls, the number lost each day, and the final number of golf balls. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_golf_balls` that takes four variables: `InitialGolfBalls`, `LostOnTuesday`, `LostOnWednesday`, and `FinalGolfBalls`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total number of golf balls lost is the sum of `LostOnTuesday` and `LostOnWednesday`.\n3. The final number of golf balls is the difference between the initial number of golf balls and the total number of golf balls lost.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `FinalGolfBalls` given the initial number of golf balls, and the number lost on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of golf balls remaining after losses\nremaining_golf_balls(InitialGolfBalls, LostOnTuesday, LostOnWednesday, FinalGolfBalls) :-\n    TotalLost is LostOnTuesday + LostOnWednesday,\n    FinalGolfBalls is InitialGolfBalls - TotalLost.\n\n% Example query to find out how many golf balls Michael has at the end of Wednesday\n% Given initial golf balls as 58, lost on Tuesday as 23, and lost on Wednesday as 2\n?- remaining_golf_balls(58, 23, 2, FinalGolfBalls).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the final number of golf balls based on the given initial count and the number lost on each day.

Initially, there were 28 children riding the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus at the bus stop, and some children also got off, resulting in a total of 30 children on the bus afterward. To find out the difference, we need to calculate the number of children who got on and off and then compare these figures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into logical steps:\n\n1.

Express the relationship between the variables: \n    - The total number of children on the bus afterward is the sum of the initial count and those who boarded, minus those who got off: `TotalChildrenAfter is InitialChildren + BoardedChildren - ChildrenGotOff`.\n    - The number of children who got on the bus is the number who boarded at the stop minus those who got off: `ChildrenGotOn is BoardedChildren - ChildrenGotOff`.\n3. Calculate the difference between children getting on and off: `Difference is ChildrenGotOn - ChildrenGotOff`.\n4.

On the first day, he picked a certain number of tomatoes, and then he picked more on the second day.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to find out how many more cookies Paco gave to his friend compared to the number he ate. Initially, Paco had 12 cookies. He ate 16 cookies, and we need to determine if he gave more or less than 16 cookies to his friend. The comparison will help us find out if he gave more cookies to his friend than he ate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be analyzed using simple arithmetic:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of cookies Paco had: 12 cookies.\n2. Paco ate 16 cookies.\n3. Paco gave 21 cookies to his friend.\n4. To find out if he gave more cookies to his friend than he ate, we can subtract the number of cookies eaten from the number given: \\( 21 - 16 \\).\n5. If the result is positive, then Paco gave more cookies to his friend. If it's negative, he ate more than he gave.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining a rule that calculates and compares the number of cookies given to the friend with the number eaten. Here\u2019s a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `cookie_comparison` that takes four variables: `InitialCookies`, `EatenCookies`, `GivenCookies`, and `ComparisonResult`.\n2. Calculate the difference between `GivenCookies` and `EatenCookies` to find out if Paco gave more or less cookies to his friend.\n3. Use conditional logic in Prolog to determine if the difference is positive or negative, and accordingly, set the `ComparisonResult` to \"more\" or \"less.\"\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find out the comparison result, i.e., whether Paco gave more or less cookies to his friend than he ate.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to compare the number of cookies given to the friend with the number eaten\ncookie_comparison(InitialCookies, EatenCookies, GivenCookies, ComparisonResult) :-\n    Difference is GivenCookies - EatenCookies,\n    (Difference > 0 -> ComparisonResult = \"more\" ; ComparisonResult = \"less\").\n\n% Example query to find out if Paco gave more or less cookies to his friend than he ate\n% Given initial cookies as 12, eaten cookies as 16, and given cookies as 21\n?- cookie_comparison(12, 16, 21, ComparisonResult).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and compares the number of cookies given to the number eaten.

We need to find out the number of peaches that Jill has using the given relationships. Steven has 14 peaches, and Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven. Additionally, Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill. To determine the number of peaches Jill has, we need to set up equations that represent these relationships and solve for Jill's peaches.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Steven has 14 peaches.\n   - Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven.\n   - Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill.\n2. Set up equations to represent the relationships:\n   - Let 'J' represent the number of peaches Jill has.\n   - Jake's peaches can be represented as (Steven's peaches - 6) or (14 - 6).\n   - According to the relationship with Jill, Jake's peaches can also be expressed as (Jill's peaches + 3) or (J + 3).\n3. Set up an equation equating the two representations of Jake's peaches:\n   - (14 - 6) = (J + 3)\n4. Solve for 'J' to find the number of peaches Jill has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining rules to capture the relationships between Steven's, Jake's, and Jill's peaches. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define constants for the known quantities: `steven_peaches` as 14, and `difference` as 6.\n2. Define a rule `jake_peaches` to calculate the number of peaches Jake has, which is `difference` less than `steven_peaches`.\n3. Define another rule `jill_peaches` to relate Jake's peaches to Jill's peaches, where Jake has `difference2` (3 in this case) more peaches than Jill.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `jill_peaches` given the defined rules and constants.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define constants\nsteven_peaches(14).\ndifference(6).\n\n% Define the rule for Jake's peaches\njake_peaches(JakePeaches) :-\n    steven_peaches(S),\n    difference(D),\n    JakePeaches is S - D.\n\n% Define the rule for Jill's peaches\njill_peaches(JillPeaches) :-\n    jake_peaches(J),\n    difference2(3),  % Define difference2 as 3\n    JillPeaches is J - 3.\n\n% Example query to find out how many peaches Jill has\n?- jill_peaches(JillPeaches).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up the relationships and queries the number of peaches Jill has based on the given information about Steven's and Jake's peaches.

To solve this, we need to compare the final counts of birds and storks.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Initial State**: There were 2 birds on the fence.\n2. **New Birds**: Five more birds joined, so the total number of birds becomes 2 + 5 = 7 birds.\n3. **New Stork**: Four storks joined as well, resulting in a total of 4 storks.\n4. **Comparison**: To find out how many more birds than storks, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of birds and the total number of storks.\n5. **Answer**: Subtract the total number of storks from the total number of birds to get the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the difference between the number of birds and storks on the fence. Our plan will include the following steps:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `birds_vs_storks` that takes four parameters: `InitialBirds`, `NewBirds`, `NewStorks`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate Total Birds**: Inside the rule, compute the total number of birds by adding `InitialBirds` and `NewBirds`.\n3. **Calculate Total Storks**: Determine the total number of storks by considering `NewStorks` (as the initial number of storks is not given).\n4. **Compute Difference**: Find the difference between the total number of birds and the total number of storks to derive the value of `Difference`.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying mechanism to find the value of `Difference` by providing the initial conditions (initial birds, new birds, and new storks).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between the number of birds and storks on the fence\nbirds_vs_storks(InitialBirds, NewBirds, NewStorks, Difference) :-\n    TotalBirds is InitialBirds + NewBirds,\n    TotalStorks is NewStorks,  % Assuming no initial storks\n    Difference is TotalBirds - TotalStorks.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more birds than storks are on the fence\n% Given initial birds as 2, new birds as 5, and new storks as 4\n?- birds_vs_storks(2, 5, 4, Difference).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial and new counts of birds and storks, and it computes the difference in their numbers.

The recipe calls for a certain number of cups of flour and sugar, and she has already added some amounts of these ingredients. Now, she wants to know how much more sugar she needs to add to complete the recipe.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. **Initial Sugar Requirement**: The recipe calls for a total of 14 cups of sugar.\n2. **Sugar Already Added**: Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar.\n3. **Remaining Sugar**: To determine how many more cups of sugar are needed, we subtract the amount of sugar already added from the initial sugar requirement: \\(14 \\text{ cups} - 2 \\text{ cups} = ?\\)\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the remaining amount of sugar needed. Our plan will involve the following steps:\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `remaining_sugar` that takes three parameters: `TotalSugarRequired`, `SugarAlreadyAdded`, and `RemainingSugar`.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Sugar**: Inside the rule, subtract the `SugarAlreadyAdded` from the `TotalSugarRequired` to find the `RemainingSugar`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying mechanism to find out the remaining amount of sugar needed by providing the total sugar required and the amount already added.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining amount of sugar needed\nremaining_sugar(TotalSugarRequired, SugarAlreadyAdded, RemainingSugar) :-\n    RemainingSugar is TotalSugarRequired - SugarAlreadyAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add\n% Given total sugar required as 14 cups and sugar already added as 2 cups\n?- remaining_sugar(14, 2, RemainingSugar).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the total sugar required, the amount already added, and the remaining sugar needed.

        "question": "Rachel had to complete 10 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of reading homework than math homework, how many pages did she have to complete in all?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRachel has been assigned two types of homework: math homework and reading homework. She has 10 pages of math homework to complete. The question also states that she has 3 more pages of reading homework than math homework. The task is to determine the total number of pages Rachel has to complete, taking into account both types of homework.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of pages, we need to consider both the math homework and the reading homework:\n\n1. **Math Homework**: Rachel has 10 pages of math homework.\n2. **Reading Homework**: The number of pages of reading homework is 3 more than the number of pages of math homework, so it can be calculated as 10 + 3 = 13 pages.\n3. **Total Pages**: To get the total number of pages, we add up the pages from both types of homework.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the total number of pages based on the given information about math and reading homework. Our plan will involve the following steps:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `total_homework_pages` that accepts four parameters: `MathPages`, `ExtraReadingPages`, `ReadingPages`, and `TotalPages`.\n2. **Calculate Reading Pages**: Inside the rule, determine the number of reading pages by adding `ExtraReadingPages` to `MathPages`.\n3. **Calculate Total Pages**: Compute the total number of pages by summing up `MathPages` and `ReadingPages`.\n4. **Query with SWI-Prolog**: Utilize SWI-Prolog's querying mechanism to find the total number of pages Rachel has to complete, given the details about her math and reading homework.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of homework pages\ntotal_homework_pages(MathPages, ExtraReadingPages, ReadingPages, TotalPages) :-\n    ReadingPages is MathPages + ExtraReadingPages,\n    TotalPages is MathPages + ReadingPages.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of pages Rachel has to complete\n% Given math pages as 10 and extra reading pages as 3\n?- total_homework_pages(10, 3, ReadingPages, TotalPages).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the total homework pages.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe Razorback t-shirt shop earns a fixed amount of $106 for each t-shirt sold. During two separate events, the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game, they sold a total of 242 t-shirts combined. It is also known that they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. The task is to determine the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, we can use the given information:\n\n1. **Profit per T-Shirt**: The shop makes $106 profit per t-shirt.\n2. **Total T-Shirts Sold**: In both games, they sold a total of 242 t-shirts.\n3. **Arkansas Game Sales**: During the Arkansas game, 115 t-shirts were sold.\n4. **Unknown**: The number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game needs to be determined.\n\nThe problem can be solved by subtracting the profit from the Arkansas game sales from the total profit made from selling 242 t-shirts. Then, by dividing this result by the profit per t-shirt, we can find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game based on the given profit per t-shirt, total t-shirts sold, and the sales from the Arkansas game. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `texas_tech_sales` that takes four parameters: `ProfitPerShirt`, `TotalShirtsSold`, `ArkansasSales`, and `TexasTechSales`.\n2. **Calculate Profit from Texas Tech Sales**: Inside the rule, subtract the profit from Arkansas sales (`ArkansasSales * ProfitPerShirt`) from the total profit made from selling `TotalShirtsSold` t-shirts.\n3. **Compute Texas Tech Sales**: Divide the calculated profit from Texas Tech sales by the `ProfitPerShirt` to find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.\n4. **Query Using SWI-Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine `TexasTechSales` by providing the known values for profit per shirt, total shirts sold, and Arkansas game sales.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game\ntexas_tech_sales(ProfitPerShirt, TotalShirtsSold, ArkansasSales, TexasTechSales) :-\n    TotalProfit is TotalShirtsSold * ProfitPerShirt,\n    ArkansasProfit is ArkansasSales * ProfitPerShirt,\n    TexasTechProfit is TotalProfit - ArkansasProfit,\n    TexasTechSales is TexasTechProfit / ProfitPerShirt.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game\n% Given profit per shirt as $106, total shirts sold as 242, and Arkansas sales as 115\n?- texas_tech_sales(106, 242, 115, TexasTechSales).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the various parameters and computes the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game based on the provided financial data.

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `books_sold` that accepts four parameters: `InitialBooks`, `GivenToFriend`, `FinalBooks`, and `BooksSold` (the unknown quantity).\n2. **Calculate Books Sold**: Inside the rule, set up the equation to solve for `BooksSold`: subtract the sum of `GivenToFriend` and `FinalBooks` from `InitialBooks`.\n3. **Query Using SWI-Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying mechanism to find the value of `BooksSold` by providing the known quantities (initial books, books given to the friend, and final books).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of books sold in the garage sale\nbooks_sold(InitialBooks, GivenToFriend, FinalBooks, BooksSold) :-\n    BooksSold is InitialBooks - (GivenToFriend + FinalBooks).\n\n% Example query to find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale\n% Given initial books as 108, books given to friend as 35, and final books left as 62\n?- books_sold(108, 35, 62, BooksSold).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the unknown quantity (books sold). By executing the query, Prolog will compute and provide the answer for the number of books Paul sold in the garage sale.",

Identify the number of saltwater aquariums: 56 aquariums.\n2. Identify the number of animals in each aquarium: 39 animals.\n3. Calculate the total number of saltwater animals by multiplying the number of saltwater aquariums by the number of animals per aquarium.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining a rule that relates the number of saltwater aquariums, the number of animals per aquarium, and the total count of saltwater animals. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `saltwater_animals` that accepts three arguments: `NumSaltwaterAquariums`, `AnimalsPerAquarium`, and `TotalSaltwaterAnimals`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total number of saltwater animals is found by multiplying the number of saltwater aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium.\n3. Utilize SWI-Prolog's query functionality to determine `TotalSaltwaterAnimals` given the number of saltwater aquariums and the count of animals per aquarium.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of saltwater animals\nsaltwater_animals(NumSaltwaterAquariums, AnimalsPerAquarium, TotalSaltwaterAnimals) :-\n    TotalSaltwaterAnimals is NumSaltwaterAquariums * AnimalsPerAquarium.\n\n% Example query to find out how many saltwater animals Tyler has\n% Given the number of saltwater aquariums as 56 and 39 animals in each aquarium\n?- saltwater_animals(56, 39, TotalSaltwaterAnimals).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship and computes the total number of saltwater animals based on the given number of saltwater aquariums and the count of animals in each aquarium.

Each bookshelf can hold 2 books, and he has a total of 38 books. The goal is to find out how many bookshelves are required to accommodate all his books.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a division calculation. Given that each bookshelf can hold 2 books, we can divide the total number of books (38) by the capacity of each bookshelf to find the number of bookshelves needed. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Bookshelves} = \\frac{\\text{Total Number of Books}}{\\text{Books per Bookshelf}} \\]\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of bookshelves required based on the total number of books and the capacity of each bookshelf.

After Jessica cut some more roses from her garden, which initially had 59 roses, the vase now contains 20 roses. The goal is to determine how many roses Jessica cut.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of roses Jessica cut, we can set up and solve a simple equation:\n\n1. Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut as 'x'.\n2. Initially, there were 7 roses in the vase.\n3. After adding the cut roses, the total number of roses in the vase became 20.\n4. So, 7 (initial roses) + x (cut roses) = 20 (final roses in the vase).\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe are given information about Paul's initial number of books, his actions of selling and buying books, and the current total number of books he possesses. The task is to determine how many more books he bought than he sold. Initially, Paul had 71 books. After selling an unknown number of books in a garage sale, he bought 38 new ones. Now, he has a total of 116 books. To find out the difference between the number of books bought and sold, we need to set up an equation that represents this relationship.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n1. Initial number of books, denoted as `InitialBooks`, is 71.\n2. The number of books sold, denoted as `SoldBooks`, is unknown.\n3. The number of new books bought, denoted as `BoughtBooks`, is 38.\n4. The current total number of books, denoted as `TotalBooks`, is 116.\n\nTo find the relationship between the number of books bought and sold, we can set up the following equation:\n\n```\nInitialBooks + SoldBooks - BoughtBooks = TotalBooks\n```\n\nNow, we need to rearrange the equation to solve for `SoldBooks`:\n\n```\nSoldBooks = TotalBooks - InitialBooks + BoughtBooks\n```\n\nFinally, to find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can calculate the difference:\n\n```\nBooksBoughtExcess = BoughtBooks - SoldBooks\n```\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to define rules for these relationships and then query for the solution:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves determining how many packs of DVDs can be purchased with a given amount of money after applying a discount. Each pack of DVDs costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 per pack. We want to find out how many packs can be bought with $93. To solve this, we need to consider the discounted price of each pack and then calculate how many packs the $93 can afford.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about Ryan's daily study routine. Ryan spends a fixed amount of time, which is 7 hours, on learning English. For learning Chinese, he spends some unspecified number of hours. We also know that the number of hours he spends on English is 2 more than the number of hours he spends on Chinese. The goal is to find out how many hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve for the number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese, we can set up and solve a simple equation using the given information:\n\n1. Let 'x' be the number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese.\n2. Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English, which is 2 more than the hours spent on Chinese: \\( 7 = x + 2 \\).\n3. Isolating 'x,' we get: \\( x = 7 - 2 \\), which simplifies to \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo encode this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that establishes the relationship between the number of hours spent on English, the number of hours spent on Chinese, and the difference between these two values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `study_hours` that accepts three parameters: `EnglishHours`, `ChineseHours`, and `Difference`.\n2. Express the condition that `EnglishHours` is greater than `ChineseHours` by `Difference` using the `>` operator.\n3.

Jake, another person, has a similar collection of fruits, but with a slight difference: he has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than Steven. The goal is to determine how many more apples Steven has compared to his peaches. To solve this, we need to find the difference between the number of apples and peaches that Steven possesses.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo tackle this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand Fruit Counts**: First, we need to grasp the number of apples and peaches that Steven has.

We need to determine how many pens Paul sold in the garage sale. This problem involves comparing the initial and final quantities of pens to find the difference, which represents the number of pens sold.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the initial and final counts of pens:\n\n1. Initially, Paul had 42 pens.\n2. After the garage sale, he had 19 pens left.\n3. The difference between the initial and final counts of pens will give us the number of pens sold in the garage sale.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will be structured as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `pens_sold` that takes four arguments: `InitialPens`, `FinalPens`, `BooksSold`, and `PensSold`.\n2. In the rule, calculate `PensSold` by finding the difference between `InitialPens` and `FinalPens`.\n3. Include `BooksSold` as a parameter to represent the number of books sold, although it is not used in the calculation of `PensSold`.\n4.

This problem involves comparing two quantities and finding the disparity between them.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Camp Attendees**: The number of kids from Lawrence County who went to camp during summer break is 819,058.\n2. **Stayed Home**: The number of kids from the same county who stayed home is 668,278.\n3. **Difference**: To find out how many more kids went to camp, we subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the number who attended camp.\n4. **Interpretation**: A positive result indicates that more kids went to camp, while a negative result would suggest that more kids stayed home.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo approach this problem in SWI-Prolog, we will create a rule that calculates the difference between the number of kids who went to camp and those who stayed home.

Initially, there were 21 children riding the bus. At the bus stop, 10 children got off, and then an unknown number of children got on. In the end, there were a total of 16 children on the bus. The task is to determine how many children got on at the bus stop.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of children who boarded the bus at the bus stop, we can set up and solve a simple equation:\n\n1. Let's represent the unknown number of children who got on the bus as \"x.\"\n2. We know that initially there were 21 children, and 10 got off, so the equation becomes: \\( 21 - 10 + x = 16 \\).\n3. Simplifying the equation, we get: \\( 11 + x = 16 \\).\n4. To isolate \"x,\" subtract 11 from both sides: \\( x = 16 - 11 \\), which gives us \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nSo, 5 children boarded the bus at the bus stop.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo express this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that relates the initial number of children, those who got off, those who got on, and the final total.

Identify the total number of days for which the calculation needs to be done: 51 days.\n4. Calculate the total number of sacks harvested over 51 days: \\( 74 \\times 51 \\).\n5. Calculate the total number of sacks discarded over 51 days: \\( 71 \\times 51 \\).\n6. To find the final count of sacks, subtract the total number of sacks discarded from the total number of sacks harvested.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining rules that capture the relationships between the number of sacks harvested daily, the number of sacks discarded daily, the total number of days, and the final count of sacks. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_sacks_harvested` that calculates the total number of sacks harvested over a given number of days. It takes three variables: `SacksPerDay`, `NumberOfDays`, and `TotalHarvestedSacks`.\n2. Define another rule `total_sacks_discarded` to calculate the total number of sacks discarded over a given number of days. It also takes similar variables: `SacksPerDay`, `NumberOfDays`, and `TotalDiscardedSacks`.\n3. The final count of sacks is the difference between the total number of sacks harvested and the total number of sacks discarded. Define a rule `final_sack_count` that uses the previously defined rules to calculate this.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for the final count of sacks given the sacks harvested per day, sacks discarded per day, and the total number of days.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of sacks harvested\ntotal_sacks_harvested(SacksPerDay, NumberOfDays, TotalHarvestedSacks) :-\n    TotalHarvestedSacks is SacksPerDay * NumberOfDays.\n\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of sacks discarded\ntotal_sacks_discarded(SacksPerDay, NumberOfDays, TotalDiscardedSacks) :-\n    TotalDiscardedSacks is SacksPerDay * NumberOfDays.\n\n% Define the rule to calculate the final count of sacks\nfinal_sack_count(SacksHarvestedPerDay, SacksDiscardedPerDay, NumberOfDays, FinalSackCount) :-\n    total_sacks_harvested(SacksHarvestedPerDay, NumberOfDays, TotalHarvestedSacks),\n    total_sacks_discarded(SacksDiscardedPerDay, NumberOfDays, TotalDiscardedSacks),\n    FinalSackCount is TotalHarvestedSacks - TotalDiscardedSacks.\n\n% Example query to find the final count of sacks after 51 days\n% Given 74 sacks harvested per day and 71 sacks discarded per day\n?- final_sack_count(74, 71, 51, FinalSackCount).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary rules to compute the final count of sacks based on the given information.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `total_marbles`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialMarbles`, `ReceivedMarbles`, and `TotalMarbles`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Inside the rule, use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the sum of `InitialMarbles` and `ReceivedMarbles`, resulting in `TotalMarbles`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that utilizes this rule to find out the total number of marbles Josh has now, given the initial count and the received marbles.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of marbles Josh has\ntotal_marbles(InitialMarbles, ReceivedMarbles, TotalMarbles) :-\n    TotalMarbles is InitialMarbles + ReceivedMarbles.\n\n% Example query to find out how many marbles Josh has now\n% Given initial marbles as 22 and received marbles from Jack as 20\n?- total_marbles(22, 20, TotalMarbles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet establishes a relationship between the initial marble count and the additional marbles received, allowing us to compute the total number of marbles Josh possesses.

The goal is to determine the number of peaches Jake has, given that he has 10 fewer peaches than Steven and 84 more apples.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of peaches Jake has, we need to consider the relationships between their possessions:\n\n1. **Apples Comparison**: Jake has 84 more apples than Steven.

For example, `steven_peaches(SP) :- jill_peaches(JP), SP is JP + 18.`\n3. **Query**: Write a query to find Jake's peach count based on the defined rules.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Rule for Jill's peaches\njill_peaches(5).\n\n% Rule for Steven's peaches\nsteven_peaches(SP) :-\n    jill_peaches(JP),\n    SP is JP + 18.\n\n% Rule for Jake's peaches\njake_peaches(JP) :-\n    steven_peaches(SP),\n    JP is SP - 6.\n\n% Query to find Jake's peach count\n?- jake_peaches(JakePeaches).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships between the peach counts of Jill, Steven, and Jake. The queries provided will execute in a Prolog environment to yield the number of peaches each person has, and ultimately, the correct number of peaches for Jake.",

Currently, there are 6 apples on the tree.\n\nThe initial number of apples can be calculated by adding the number of apples picked and the number of new apples to the current count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the initial number of apples based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a rule `initial_apples`**: This rule will take four arguments - `ApplesPicked`, `NewApples`, `CurrentApples`, and `InitialApples`.\n2. **Arithmetic operations**: \n    - Calculate the total change in apples by adding `ApplesPicked` and `NewApples`.\n    - Compute `InitialApples` by summing the total change with `CurrentApples`.\n3. **Query using SWI-Prolog**: Write a query to find the initial number of apples given the values of apples picked, new apples, and current apples.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial number of apples\ninitial_apples(ApplesPicked, NewApples, CurrentApples, InitialApples) :-\n    TotalChange is ApplesPicked + NewApples,\n    InitialApples is CurrentApples + TotalChange.\n\n% Example query to find the initial number of apples\n% Given 7 apples picked, 2 new apples, and 6 current apples\n?- initial_apples(7, 2, 6, InitialApples).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the various apple counts and computes the initial number of apples.

Define a rule `compare_given_lost` that takes five variables: `TotalCrayons`, `LostCrayons`, `GivenAwayCrayons`, `Difference`, and a relational operator `Relation`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: calculate the difference between `GivenAwayCrayons` and `LostCrayons`.\n3. Compare the difference with 0 using the relational operator `Relation` to determine if more crayons were given away than lost.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `Relation` given the total, lost, and given away crayons. Adjust the query to ask for the relation that satisfies the comparison.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to compare the number of crayons given away to the number lost\ncompare_given_lost(TotalCrayons, LostCrayons, GivenAwayCrayons, Difference, Relation) :-\n    Difference is GivenAwayCrayons - LostCrayons,\n    Relation = (Difference > 0).\n\n% Example query to find out the relation between given away and lost crayons\n% Given total crayons as 267, lost crayons as 231, and given away crayons as 308\n?- compare_given_lost(267, 231, 308, Difference, Relation).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and allows us to compare the number of crayons given away to the number lost.

Doug lost 7 marbles at the playground, so we subtract that from his initial count to find the current number of marbles he has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that encapsulates the relationships between the number of marbles Ed had, the number of marbles Doug initially had, the number of marbles Doug lost, and the final number of marbles Doug has. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `marbles_doug` that takes four variables: `EdsMarbles`, `InitialDougMarbles`, `LostMarbles`, and `FinalDougMarbles`.\n2. Express the relationship that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug: `EdsMarbles` is `InitialDougMarbles + 6`.\n3. Doug lost some marbles, so `FinalDougMarbles` is `InitialDougMarbles - LostMarbles`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `FinalDougMarbles` given the values of `EdsMarbles` and `LostMarbles`.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of marbles Doug has now\nmarbles_doug(EdsMarbles, InitialDougMarbles, LostMarbles, FinalDougMarbles) :-\n    EdsMarbles is InitialDougMarbles + 6,\n    FinalDougMarbles is InitialDougMarbles - LostMarbles.\n\n% Example query to find out how many marbles Doug has now\n% Given Ed's marbles as 22 and lost marbles as 7\n?- marbles_doug(22, InitialDougMarbles, 7, FinalDougMarbles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and computes the final number of marbles Doug has based on the given information.

She has already added an unknown quantity of flour. To determine how much more flour she needs, we must consider the relationship between the quantities of flour and sugar. Specifically, we are told that she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. This constraint will help us calculate the required amount of flour.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of logical and arithmetic steps:\n\n1. **Given Quantities**: We know that the recipe requires 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar in total.\n2. **Unknown Quantity**: We don't know how much flour Mary has already used, which is represented by 'X' cups.\n3. **Constraint**: The clue \"she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar\" means that the amount of flour left to add is 8 cups more than the sugar left to add.\n4. **Sugar Left to Add**: Calculate how much sugar is left to be added. This is derived from the total sugar required minus any flour already used, as they share the same unit of measurement (cups).\n5. **Flour Left to Add**: Using the constraint, we can calculate how much flour is left to be added, ensuring it is 8 cups more than the sugar left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define rules and constraints to represent the relationships between the quantities of flour and sugar.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nPaul initially had an unknown number of books. After selling 137 books in a garage sale, he is left with 105 books. The task is to determine the number of books Paul had at the start. This problem involves basic subtraction, where we need to find the difference between the initial count and the sold count to determine the starting quantity.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can structure it as follows:\n\n1. **Unknown Initial Count**: Represent the initial number of books as a variable, say, `InitialBooks`.\n2. **Sold Books**: We know that Paul sold 137 books, which is a given fact.\n3. **Remaining Books**: After the sale, Paul has 105 books left, which is also given.\n4. **Calculation**: To find the initial count, we subtract the sold books from the initial count: `InitialBooks - 137 = 105`.\n5. **Solution**: Solving for `InitialBooks`, we get: `InitialBooks = 137 + 105 = 242`. So, Paul had 242 books at the start.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the initial number of books based on the number sold and the remaining count. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `initial_books` that accepts three parameters: `InitialBooks`, `SoldBooks`, and `RemainingBooks`.\n2. **Express Relationship**: Inside the rule, express the relationship between these variables: `InitialBooks` is the sum of `SoldBooks` and `RemainingBooks`.\n3. **Query**: Use SWI-Prolog's querying to find the initial count by providing the number of books sold and the remaining count.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial number of books Paul had\ninitial_books(InitialBooks, SoldBooks, RemainingBooks) :-\n    InitialBooks is SoldBooks + RemainingBooks.\n\n% Example query to find out how many books Paul had at the start\n% Given sold books as 137 and remaining books as 105\n?- initial_books(InitialBooks, 137, 105).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial count and the given values.

        "question": "Jesse's room is 7 feet long. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet, what is the width of her room?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task is to determine the width of Jesse's room, given its length and the total area of the carpet she needs. We are provided with the length of the room, which is 7 feet, and the total area of the carpet required, which is 14 square feet. The goal is to find the width that would result in a carpet of the desired area.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the formula for the area of a rectangle: \n\n**Area = Length \u00d7 Width**\n\nIn this case, we know the area (14 square feet) and the length (7 feet), and we want to find the width:\n\n**Width = Area / Length**\n\nBy substituting the given values, we can calculate the width as follows:\n\n**Width = 14 square feet / 7 feet**\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the width of the room based on the given length and the desired area. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `room_width` that accepts three parameters: `Length`, `Area`, and `Width`.\n2. **Calculate Width**: Inside the rule, use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the width by dividing the given area by the length.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying mechanism to find the width of the room by providing the known length and the desired area as inputs.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the width of the room\nroom_width(Length, Area, Width) :-\n    Width is Area / Length.\n\n% Example query to find the width of Jesse's room\n% Given length of the room as 7 feet and desired carpet area as 14 square feet\n?- room_width(7, 14, Width).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet encapsulates the relationship between the length, area, and width of the room. By executing the query, Prolog will compute the width required for the carpet to cover the desired area in Jesse's room, based on the provided dimensions.",

To find the number of peaches Jill has, we need to consider the relationships between the number of peaches each person has and use that information to set up and solve a system of equations.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the relationships step by step:\n\n1. Steven has 18 peaches. This is given as a fact.\n2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. This can be expressed as: \\( J = S - 12 \\), where J is the number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.\n3. Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. This can be written as: \\( S = J + 8 \\).\n4.
