Initially, Shawn has five toys. He received two toys each from his mom and dad. To find the total number of toys Shawn has now, we need to add the toys he received to his initial count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of toys Shawn has: 5 toys.\n2. Identify the number of toys received from his mom: 2 toys.\n3. Identify the number of toys received from his dad: 2 toys.\n4. Calculate the total number of toys received from both parents: \\(2 + 2\\).\n5. Add the total number of toys received to the initial number of toys to find the final count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial number of toys, the number of toys received from each parent, and the final number of toys. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_toys` that takes four variables: `InitialToys`, `ToysFromMom`, `ToysFromDad`, and `FinalToys`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total number of toys received is the sum of `ToysFromMom` and `ToysFromDad`.\n3. The final number of toys is the sum of the initial number of toys and the total number of toys received.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `FinalToys` given the initial number of toys, the number of toys from mom, and the number of toys from dad.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of toys Shawn has\ntotal_toys(InitialToys, ToysFromMom, ToysFromDad, FinalToys) :-\n    TotalReceived is ToysFromMom + ToysFromDad,\n    FinalToys is InitialToys + TotalReceived.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of toys Shawn has now\n% Given initial toys as 5, toys from mom as 2, and toys from dad as 2\n?- total_toys(5, 2, 2, FinalToys).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the final number of toys based on the given initial count and the number of toys received from each parent.

Initially, there were 9 computers. Each day, from Monday to Thursday, 5 more computers were added. The goal is to determine the total count of computers by the end of Thursday.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Start with the known number of computers, which is 9.\n2. **Daily Installation**: Each day, 5 computers are added.\n3. **Number of Days**: Computers were added for 4 consecutive days (Monday to Thursday).\n4. **Total Computers Added**: Multiply the number of computers added daily by the number of days (4 days).\n5. **Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to get the final number of computers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the final number of computers based on the initial count, the number of days, and the number of computers added each day. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_computers` that accepts four parameters: `InitialComputers`, `Days`, `ComputersPerDay`, and `FinalComputers`.\n2. **Calculate Total Added**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of computers added over the days as the product of `Days` and `ComputersPerDay`.\n3. **Calculate Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to derive the final count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the final number of computers by providing the initial conditions (initial count, number of days, and computers added per day).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of computers in the server room\ntotal_computers(InitialComputers, Days, ComputersPerDay, FinalComputers) :-\n    TotalAdded is Days * ComputersPerDay,\n    FinalComputers is InitialComputers + TotalAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of computers now in the server room\n% Given initial computers as 9, days as 4, and computers installed per day as 5\n?- total_computers(9, 4, 5, FinalComputers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

Use arithmetic operations to calculate half the difference between girls and boys: `GirlBoyDifference` divided by 2.\n3.

Kids who stayed home are assumed to be from Lawrence County, while those who went to camp are also counted, along with a small number of kids from outside the county who attended the camp.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by first identifying the number of kids who are definitely from Lawrence County (those who stayed home). Then, we need to add the number of kids who went to camp, assuming some of them might also be from Lawrence County. Finally, we should subtract the number of kids from outside the county who attended the camp, as they are not residents.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the exact number of green peaches present in the basket, given the initial presence of 3 red peaches and a difference of 10 more green peaches than red peaches. We will calculate the number of green peaches by first finding out the total number of red peaches and then adding the specified difference to it.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into clear arithmetic steps:\n\n1. We have an initial count of 3 red peaches.\n2. The number of green peaches is 10 more than the number of red peaches.\n3. We need to calculate the total number of red peaches to determine the total number of green peaches: \\( 3 + \\text{unknown number} \\).\n4. The total number of green peaches is then found by adding 10 to this total number of red peaches.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that computes the number of green peaches based on the initial count of red peaches and the specified difference. Here's the step-by-step Prolog code plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `count_green_peaches` with three variables: `RedPeaches`, which represents the number of red peaches, `GreenPeaches`, which is the unknown number of green peaches, and `Difference`, which signifies the difference in count between green and red peaches.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to indicate the relationship between these variables: the total number of red peaches is the sum of `RedPeaches` and an unknown value, which we'll call `X` (\\( X \\)). The total number of green peaches is then calculated as `RedPeaches + X + Difference`.\n3. Use Prolog's querying features to find the solution for `GreenPeaches` with the given initial count of red peaches and the specified difference.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of green peaches\ncount_green_peaches(red_peaches, green_peaches, difference) :-\n    x is green_peaches - red_peaches,\n    total_red is red_peaches + x,\n    green_peaches is total_red + difference.\n\n% Example query to find the number of green peaches in the basket\n% When there are 3 red peaches and a difference of 10\n?- count_green_peaches(3, GreenPeaches, 10).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship and computes the accurate number of green peaches using the provided initial count of red peaches and the difference in counts.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nPaul's book collection underwent changes after a garage sale and subsequent book purchases. We need to determine the difference between the books he bought and the books he sold. Starting with 71 books, Paul sold some and then bought 38 new ones. The task is to find out the net difference in the number of books, which can be calculated by subtracting the books sold from the books bought.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down this problem into simple steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of books Paul had: 71 books.\n2. Find out the number of books sold during the garage sale: This is the difference between the initial number of books and the number of books Paul had after the garage sale (before buying new ones).\n3. Identify the number of books Paul bought: 38 books.\n4. Subtract the number of books sold from the number of books bought to determine the net difference.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates this net difference based on the initial number of books, the number sold, and the number bought. Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `book_difference`**: This rule will have four variables: `InitialBooks`, `BooksSold`, `BooksBought`, and `NetDifference`.\n2. **Calculate books sold**: We will first calculate the number of books sold by subtracting the number of books Paul had after the garage sale (which comes before the purchase) from the initial number of books.\n3. **Calculate the Net Difference**: The net difference is then found by subtracting the number of books sold from the number of books bought.\n4. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query to find out this net difference given the initial number of books, the number bought, and the number sold (which we calculate based on the initial number and the number after the garage sale).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the net difference between books bought and sold\nbook_difference(InitialBooks, BooksBought, BooksSold, NetDifference) :-\n    BooksAfterSale is InitialBooks - ??,  % Placeholder for calculation\n    BooksSold is BooksAfterSale - BooksBought,\n    NetDifference is BooksBought - BooksSold.\n\n% Example query to find out the net difference in the number of books\n% Given initial books as 71, books bought as 38\n?- book_difference(71, 38, BooksSold, NetDifference).\n```\n\nIn this code, we have left a placeholder ?? for the number of books Paul had after the garage sale, as this number is derived from the initial count.

        "question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $ 51 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task is to calculate the total revenue the Razorback t-shirt shop earned during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game by selling discounted t-shirts. The shop normally sells each t-shirt for $51, but during the game, they offered an $8 discount per t-shirt. We need to determine the total earnings from selling 130 such t-shirts.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down this problem into steps:\n\n1. **Normal Price**: Each t-shirt costs $51.\n2. **Discount**: During the game, an $8 discount was offered per t-shirt.\n3. **Number of Shirts Sold**: 130 t-shirts were sold during the game.\n4. **Calculate Revenue**: To find the total revenue, we need to multiply the number of sold t-shirts by the price after the discount.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the total revenue based on the normal price, discount, and the number of shirts sold. Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `shop_revenue` with four variables: `normal_price`, `discount`, `sold_shirts`, and `total_revenue`.\n2. **Price after Discount**: Calculate the price of a single discounted t-shirt by subtracting the discount from the normal price.\n3. **Total Revenue**: Multiply the number of sold shirts by the price of a single discounted t-shirt to find the `total_revenue`.\n4. **Query the Prolog Database**: Use a query to find the total revenue earned by the shop given the normal price, discount, and number of sold shirts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the shop's revenue\nshop_revenue(normal_price, discount, sold_shirts, total_revenue) :-\n    discounted_price is normal_price - discount,\n    total_revenue is sold_shirts * discounted_price.\n\n% Example query to find out the total revenue from selling the t-shirts\n% Given the normal price as $51, discount as $8, and 130 shirts sold\n?- shop_revenue(51, 8, 130, total_revenue).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the normal pricing, discount, number of shirts sold, and the resulting total revenue.

Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `fruit_difference`**: This rule will take six arguments: `JakesPeaches`, `JakesApples`, `StevensInitialPeaches`, `StevensInitialApples`, `StevensFinalPeaches`, and `StevensFinalApples`.\n2. **Calculate Steven's current peaches**: Add three to `JakesPeaches` because Steven has three more than Jake.\n3. **Calculate Steven's current apples**: Subtract four from `StevensInitialApples` as Steven has four fewer than Jake.\n4. Determine the difference between Steven's final apple and peach counts using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.\n5. Use a Prolog query to find the answer by providing the relevant initial counts for Steven and Jake's known counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between apples and peaches\nfruit_difference(JakesPeaches, JakesApples, StevensInitialPeaches, StevensInitialApples, StevensFinalPeaches, StevensFinalApples) :-\n    StevensFinalPeaches is JakesPeaches + 3,\n    StevensFinalApples is StevensInitialApples - 4,\n    Difference is StevensFinalApples - StevensFinalPeaches.\n\n% Example query to find the difference between apples and peaches for Steven\n% Given Steven's initial peaches as 15, initial apples as 19, and Jake's peaches as 12, and apples as 20\n?- fruit_difference(12, 20, 15, 19, StevensFinalPeaches, StevensFinalApples).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses the provided information to calculate the difference between apples and peaches in Steven's fruit bowl after considering Jake's counts.

Calculate `CapacityPerWheel` by multiplying `SeatsPerWheel` and `PeoplePerSeat`.\n3. Multiply `CapacityPerWheel` by the number of Ferris wheels (20) to find the `TotalCapacity`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's querying features to find the `TotalCapacity` by providing the number of seats and people per seat.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total capacity of the Ferris wheels\nferris_wheel_capacity(SeatsPerWheel, PeoplePerSeat, CapacityPerWheel, TotalCapacity) :-\n    CapacityPerWheel is SeatsPerWheel * PeoplePerSeat,\n    TotalCapacity is CapacityPerWheel * 20.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheels\n% Given seats per wheel as 19 and people per seat as 15\n?- ferris_wheel_capacity(19, 15, CapacityPerWheel, TotalCapacity).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the Ferris wheel parameters and computes the total capacity.

We need to determine how many more cups of flour she needs to add compared to the number of cups of sugar. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour in total. Mary has already started by adding 2 cups of flour. The task is to find the difference between the remaining flour and sugar.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into simple steps:\n\n1.

Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `excess_flour` that takes three variables: `TotalFlour`, `AddedFlour`, and `Difference`.\n2. Calculate the remaining flour needed by subtracting the already added flour from the total flour requirement.\n3. Compare this remaining flour requirement with the sugar requirement to find the difference, which represents the excess flour needed.\n4.

Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `marble_difference` with four variables: `ed_marbles`, `ed_advantage`, `doug_marbles`, and `new_ed_advantage`.\n2. **Calculate Doug's Initial Marbles**: Inside the rule, derive Doug's initial marble count by subtracting `ed_advantage` from `ed_marbles`.\n3. **Doug's Remaining Marbles**: Subtract the number of marbles lost from Doug's initial marble count.\n4. **Calculate New Difference**: The new difference (`new_ed_advantage`) between Ed and Doug's marble counts is the difference between Ed's and Doug's remaining marbles.\n5. **Query in Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying features to find the new difference in marble counts given Ed's initial marbles, the initial difference, and the number of marbles Doug lost.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the new difference in marble counts\nmarble_difference(ed_marbles, ed_advantage, doug_marbles, new_ed_advantage) :-\n    doug_initial_marbles is ed_marbles - ed_advantage,\n    doug_after_loss is doug_initial_marbles - 11,\n    new_ed_advantage is ed_marbles - doug_after_loss.\n\n% Example query to find the new difference in marble counts\n% Given Ed's initial marbles as 45, initial advantage as 10, and Doug's loss as 11\n?- marble_difference(45, 10, DougLostMarbles, new_advantage).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationships between the variables and calculates the new difference in marble counts after Doug's loss.

Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `program_attendees` with four variables: `Parents`, `Pupils`, `SeatingCapacity`, and `ActualAttendees`.\n2. **Calculate Initial Sum**: Compute the initial sum of parents and pupils using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.\n3. **Compare and Determine**: Compare the seating capacity with the initial sum to determine the actual number of attendees.\n4. **Query the Result**: Use Prolog's querying system to find out the actual number of people present in the program given the initial counts of parents and pupils, and the seating capacity.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of actual attendees\nprogram_attendees(Parents, Pupils, SeatingCapacity, ActualAttendees) :-\n    InitialSum is Parents + Pupils,\n    ActualAttendees is min(InitialSum, SeatingCapacity).\n\n% Example query to find out the number of people present in the program\n% Given parents as 61, pupils as 177, and seating capacity as 44\n?- program_attendees(61, 177, 44, ActualAttendees).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a relationship between the initial attendee counts and the seating capacity, and it computes the actual number of people present based on these inputs.

Find the number of campers who went rowing in the morning by subtracting the afternoon campers from the total campers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that calculates the number of campers who went rowing in the morning based on the total number of campers who rowed and the number who rowed in the afternoon. Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `morning_campers` with four variables: `TotalCampers`, `AfternoonCampers`, and `MorningCampers`.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the number of campers who went rowing in the morning: `MorningCampers` is the difference between `TotalCampers` and `AfternoonCampers`.\n3. Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the solution for `MorningCampers` given the known total and afternoon counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of campers who went rowing in the morning\nmorning_campers(TotalCampers, AfternoonCampers, MorningCampers) :-\n    MorningCampers is TotalCampers - AfternoonCampers.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of campers who went rowing in the morning\n% Given the total campers as 60 and afternoon campers as 7\n?- morning_campers(60, 7, MorningCampers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the total campers and the afternoon campers to compute the number who went rowing in the morning.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFaye has a certain number of pencils, and we need to determine the total count of pencils she possesses. Initially, she has 31 packs, each containing 6 pencils. Faye is organizing these pencils into rows, with each row accommodating 19 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils, we need to calculate how many times she can fill a row and then add the remaining pencils.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down this problem into arithmetic operations:\n\n1. Identify the number of pencils in each pack: 6 pencils per pack.\n2. Identify the number of pencils in each row: 19 pencils per row.\n3. Calculate how many times a row can be filled with the available pencils from the packs. This is calculated by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row. We'll use integer division to get the number of rows.\n4. Calculate the remaining pencils that don't fit exactly into a row. This can be found by taking the remainder of the division from step 3.\n5. The total number of pencils is found by multiplying the number of rows by the number of pencils per row, and then adding the remaining pencils.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the total number of pencils based on the given information. Here's the step-by-step plan to create this Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_pencils` that takes three variables: `PencilsPerPack`, `PencilsPerRow`, and `TotalPencils`.\n2. **Calculate Number of Rows**: Use integer division to determine how many times a row can be filled with the pencils from the packs.\n3. **Calculate Remaining Pencils**: Compute the remainder of pencils that cannot be divided evenly into a row.\n4. **Calculate Total Pencils**: Multiply the number of rows by `PencilsPerRow` and add the remaining pencils to derive the final count.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of pencils by providing the relevant parameters.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of pencils\ntotal_pencils(PencilsPerPack, PencilsPerRow, TotalPencils) :-\n    TotalFromPacks is PencilsPerPack * 31, % Calculate total pencils from packs\n    NumberOfRows is TotalFromPacks // PencilsPerRow, % Number of full rows\n    RemainingPencils is TotalFromPacks mod PencilsPerRow, % Pencils remaining after filling rows\n    TotalPencils is NumberOfRows * PencilsPerRow + RemainingPencils. % Add remaining pencils to full rows\n\n% Example query to find the total number of pencils Faye has\n% Given pencils per pack as 6 and pencils per row as 19\n?- total_pencils(6, 19, TotalPencils).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the initial packs of pencils, pencils per row, and the final total count.

Calculate the number of apples remaining after picking: \\( 4 - 2 \\).\n4. Identify the number of new apples that grew on the tree: 3 apples.\n5. Add the number of new apples to the number of apples remaining after picking to find the final count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to write a rule that computes the final number of apples based on the initial count, the number picked, and the number that grew later. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `apples_on_tree` that takes four variables: `InitialApples`, `PickedApples`, `GrewApples`, and `FinalApples`.\n2. Subtract the number of picked apples from the initial count to find the intermediate number of apples.\n3. Add the number of apples that grew later to the intermediate number to derive the final count of apples on the tree.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to solve for `FinalApples` given the initial number of apples, the picked apples, and the newly grown apples.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of apples on the tree\napples_on_tree(InitialApples, PickedApples, GrewApples, FinalApples) :-\n    IntermediateApples is InitialApples - PickedApples,\n    FinalApples is IntermediateApples + GrewApples.\n\n% Example query to find out how many apples are on Rachel's tree now\n% Given initial apples as 4, picked apples as 2, and newly grown apples as 3\n?- apples_on_tree(4, 2, 3, FinalApples).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the sequence of events and calculates the final number of apples on Rachel's tree.

We need to determine the difference between the number of files and apps left on the phone. Initially, Dave had 11 apps and 3 files. After the deletions, he has 2 apps and 24 files. To find the difference, we subtract the number of apps from the number of files.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into arithmetic steps:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the number of books remaining to be read from the 'Crazy Silly School' series after a certain number of books have already been read. There are 22 books in the series, and 12 of them have been read. Similarly, out of the 10 movies in the series, 56 have been watched. We will calculate the number of books left to read by subtracting the number of books read from the total number of books in the series.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down this problem into simple steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of books in the series: 22 books.\n2. Identify the number of books that have already been read: 12 books.\n3. Subtract the number of books read from the total books to find the remaining books to read.\n\nSimilarly, we will also calculate the number of movies left to watch, even though it's not explicitly asked in the question.\n\n1. Identify the total number of movies in the series: 10 movies.\n2. Identify the number of movies that have already been watched: 56 movies.\n3. Subtract the number of movies watched from the total movies to find the remaining movies to watch.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by defining rules that calculate the number of remaining books and movies based on the initial counts and the number of consumed content.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJesse needs to find the width of her room to accommodate a carpet of a specific size. The length of her room is known to be 7 feet, and the required carpet size is 14 square feet. To find the width, we need to solve for the dimension that would make the area of the room equal to the size of the carpet.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can analyze this problem as follows:\n\n1. We have the length of Jesse's room: 7 feet.\n2. The carpet's area is given as 14 square feet, which represents the area we need to cover in the room.\n3. We need to find the width, which is the remaining dimension after the length.\n4. We can set up a proportional relationship between the length and width to solve for the width, ensuring the area of the room matches the carpet's size.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to set up and solve the proportional relationship. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `room_width` that takes the length of the room (`RoomLength`) and the required carpet size (`CarpetSize`) as inputs, and solves for the width (`RoomWidth`).\n2. Set up the proportional relationship using arithmetic operations: cross-multiplication of the known sides will help solve for the width.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic and querying capabilities to find the width given the known length and carpet size.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the width of Jesse's room\nroom_width(room_length, carpet_size, room_width) :-\n    room_width is room_length * carpet_size / 7.\n\n% Example query to find the width of Jesse's room\n% Given room length as 7 feet and carpet size as 14 square feet\n?- room_width(7, 14, RoomWidth).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the proportional relationship and computes the width required for Jesse's room based on the given length and carpet size.

The `InitialRoses` is the difference between `FinalRoses` and `AddedRoses`.\n3. **Query**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the initial number of roses given the final count and the number of roses added.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial number of roses\ninitial_roses(FinalRoses, AddedRoses, InitialRoses) :-\n    InitialRoses is FinalRoses - AddedRoses.\n\n% Example query to find the initial number of roses in the vase\n% When final roses are 23 and 16 roses were added\n?- initial_roses(23, 16, InitialRoses).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the final rose count, the roses added, and the initial count.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, and the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper. On the other hand, the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog. By adding the difference in jump distances to the grasshopper's jump, we can find the frog's jump distance.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into arithmetic steps:\n\n1. The grasshopper's jump distance: 19 inches.\n2. The frog jumps 39 inches farther than the grasshopper: \\( 19 + 39 = 58 \\) inches.\n3. The mouse jumps 94 inches lesser than the frog: This means the frog jumps 94 inches more than the mouse.\n4. We know the mouse's jump distance is lesser than the frog's, so adding 94 inches to the mouse's jump will not give us the frog's jump distance. Instead, we should start from the grasshopper's jump and add the difference in their jumps.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the frog's jump distance based on the given jump distances of the grasshopper and the mouse.

Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `initial_ripe_apples` with three variables: `CurrentRipe`, `UnripeApples`, and `InitialRipe`.\n2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial number of ripe apples is calculated by adding 3 to the current count of ripe apples, as Rachel picked 3 ripe apples.\n3. **Query**: Use Prolog's querying system to find the initial count of ripe apples by providing the current ripe and unripe apple counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial number of ripe apples\ninitial_ripe_apples(CurrentRipe, UnripeApples, InitialRipe) :-\n    InitialRipe is CurrentRipe + 3.\n\n% Example query to find out the initial count of ripe apples\n% Given current ripe apples as 2 and unripe apples as 27\n?- initial_ripe_apples(2, 27, InitialRipe).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a straightforward relationship to determine the initial count of ripe apples. Running the query will return the answer based on the given current state of the tree.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the number of flower beds Paige and her mom created while planting flowers. They planted a total of 36 seeds, with 12 seeds placed in each flower bed. However, only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each bed. To find the number of flower beds, we need to reconcile the total number of seeds planted with the number of seeds that grew into flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of seeds planted: 36 seeds.\n2. Identify the number of seeds planted per flower bed: 12 seeds/bed.\n3. Identify the number of seeds that grew into flowers per flower bed: 58 seeds/bed.\n4. Since not all seeds grew into flowers, we need to find a way to relate the total seeds planted to the seeds that grew.\n5.

The number of seeds planted matches the total number of seeds divided by the number of seeds per bed.\n3. The number of seeds that grew into flowers per bed can also be calculated by dividing the total seeds that grew by the number of beds.\n4.
