Initially, there were 9 computers. Each day, from Monday to Thursday, 5 more computers were added. The goal is to determine the total count of computers by the end of Thursday.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Start with the known number of computers, which is 9.\n2. **Daily Installation**: Each day, 5 computers are added.\n3. **Number of Days**: Computers were added for 4 consecutive days (Monday to Thursday).\n4. **Total Computers Added**: Multiply the number of computers added daily by the number of days (4 days).\n5. **Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to get the final number of computers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the final number of computers based on the initial count, the number of days, and the number of computers added each day. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_computers` that accepts four parameters: `InitialComputers`, `Days`, `ComputersPerDay`, and `FinalComputers`.\n2. **Calculate Total Added**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of computers added over the days as the product of `Days` and `ComputersPerDay`.\n3. **Calculate Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to derive the final count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the final number of computers by providing the initial conditions (initial count, number of days, and computers added per day).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of computers in the server room\ntotal_computers(InitialComputers, Days, ComputersPerDay, FinalComputers) :-\n    TotalAdded is Days * ComputersPerDay,\n    FinalComputers is InitialComputers + TotalAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of computers now in the server room\n% Given initial computers as 9, days as 4, and computers installed per day as 5\n?- total_computers(9, 4, 5, FinalComputers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome. By executing the query, Prolog will compute the final number of computers in the server room based on the provided data."

Add the initial number of cars to the number of cars that arrive to find the total number of cars in the parking lot.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial number of cars, the number of cars that arrive, and the final number of cars.

Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `TotalCars` is the sum of `InitialCars` and `CarsArrived`.\n3.

We will use this information to calculate the initial amount of flour added by Mary.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Recipe Requirements**: The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and an equal amount of cups of sugar.\n2. **Initial Addition**: Mary has already put some cups of flour into the batter.

Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `baking_cake` that takes in four variables: `flour_required`, `sugar_required`, `initial_flour`, and `cups_flour`. The first two parameters represent the requirements from the recipe, while the third parameter is the unknown initial amount of flour added, and the last parameter is the additional cups of flour needed.\n2. **Relationship Definition**: Inside the rule, express the relationship that the `cups_flour` is two more than the initial amount of sugar added. And the initial amount of flour added is sought.\n3. **Query**: Use a Prolog query to find the solution by providing the known values.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial amount of flour added by Mary\nbaking_cake(FlourReq, SugarReq, InitialFlour, CupsFlour) :-\n    CupsFlour is 2 + InitialSugar,\n    InitialFlour is InitialSugar + SugarReq.\n\n% Example query to find the initial amount of flour\n% Given flour and sugar requirements as 11 cups each, and needing 2 more cups of flour\n?- baking_cake(11, 11, InitialFlour, 2).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up the relationship and allows us to compute the initial amount of flour Mary put in based on the given information.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the total amount of money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons, given that he currently earns a fixed amount every week during the 223-week harvest season. First, we'll calculate the total earnings for one harvest season and then multiply it by the number of seasons Lewis plans to work.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into arithmetic operations:\n\n1. **Weekly Earnings**: Lewis earns $1357 every week during the harvest season.\n2. **Weeks of Harvest Season**: The harvest season lasts for 223 weeks.\n3. **Total Earnings in One Season**: Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in one harvest season.\n4. **Total Earnings for 73 Seasons**: Multiply the total earnings of one season by the number of seasons (73).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total earnings for one harvest season first and then extends it to the total earnings for 73 seasons. Here's the step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `earn_per_season`**: This rule will calculate the total earnings in one harvest season. It should take the weekly earnings and the number of weeks as arguments and return the total earnings for one season.\n2. **Define a Rule `total_earnings`**: Build upon the previous rule to calculate the total earnings for 73 seasons. This rule will use the total earnings of one season (from the previous rule) and multiply it by 73.\n3. **Query**: Use a Prolog query to find the total earnings for the specified number of seasons (73) based on the weekly earnings and the duration of one season.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total earnings in one harvest season\nearn_per_season(WeeklyEarnings, Weeks, SeasonalEarnings) :-\n    SeasonalEarnings is WeeklyEarnings * Weeks.\n\n% Define the rule to calculate total earnings for 73 seasons\ntotal_earnings(WeeklyEarnings, Seasons, TotalEarnings) :-\n    earn_per_season(WeeklyEarnings, 223, SeasonalEarnings),  % Using 223 weeks for one season\n    TotalEarnings is SeasonalEarnings * Seasons.\n\n% Example query to find Lewis's total earnings for 73 harvest seasons\n% Given weekly earnings as $1357 and 73 seasons\n?- total_earnings(1357, 73, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code first calculates the earnings for one season and then extends it to the specified number of seasons.

We need to subtract the out-of-county kids attending the camp from the total number of kids at the camp to find the number of kids from Lawrence County.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of kids who stayed home in Lawrence County: 644997 kids.\n2. Identify the number of kids from Lawrence County who went to camp. This is the total number of kids at the camp minus the kids from outside the county: \\( 893835 - 78 \\).\n3.

This difference can be calculated by comparing the total apps before and after the deletion.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Dave starts with 15 apps.\n2. **Apps Added**: He adds 71 new apps.\n3. **Deletion Impact**: Dave deletes some apps, resulting in a final count of 14 apps.\n4. **Calculate Deletion**: To find the number of apps deleted, we can subtract the final count from the count before deletion.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the number of apps deleted beyond the number added.

Calculate the total consumption of soda bottles per day, considering Debby's consumption patterns.\n3. Determine the number of days it will take by dividing the total number of soda bottles by the daily consumption rate of soda bottles.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's querying features to find `DaysToFinishSoda` by providing the relevant initial data.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of days required to finish all soda bottles\nsoda_bottles_duration(TotalSodaBottles, SodaPerDay, WaterBottlesConsumption, DaysToFinishSoda) :-\n    % Calculate the total soda bottles consumed per day\n    DailySodaConsumption is SodaPerDay + (WaterBottlesConsumption - 0), % Assuming any remaining water bottles won't be soda\n    % Calculate the number of days it takes to finish all soda bottles\n    DaysToFinishSoda is TotalSodaBottles // SodaPerDay.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of days required for Debby to finish all soda bottles\n% Given total soda bottles as 360, soda consumed per day as 9, and water bottles consumed per day as 122\n?- soda_bottles_duration(360, 9, 122, Days).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial conditions and the number of days required.

Determine the remaining amount of sugar needed by subtracting the added sugar from the recipe's requirement.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that computes the additional sugar needed based on the ingredients already added and the recipe's requirements. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `additional_sugar_needed` with four variables: `AddedFlour`, `AddedSugar`, `RecipeSugar`, and `RemainingSugar`.\n2. Since the focus is on finding the remaining sugar, we need not consider the added flour here.\n3. Calculate the remaining sugar needed by subtracting the already added sugar from the required sugar according to the recipe.\n4. Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the value of `RemainingSugar` given the ingredients already added.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate how many cups of sugar are needed\nadditional_sugar_needed(AddedFlour, AddedSugar, RecipeSugar, RemainingSugar) :-\n    % Focus on calculating the remaining sugar needed\n    RemainingSugar is RecipeSugar - AddedSugar.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add\n% Given added flour, added sugar, and required sugar according to the recipe\n?- additional_sugar_needed(10, 2, 14, RemainingSugar).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the ingredients added and the remaining sugar needed.

Here's a systematic plan to formulate the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Initiate a rule named `marble_collection` with four variables: `InitialMarbles`, `FoundMarbles`, `LostMarbles`, and `FinalMarbles`.\n2. **Compute Net Change**: Inside the rule, calculate the net change by subtracting the lost marbles from the found marbles: `NetChange is FoundMarbles - LostMarbles`.\n3. **Update Initial Count**: Add the net change to the initial marble count to determine the final number: `FinalMarbles is InitialMarbles + NetChange`.\n4. **Utilize Prolog's Querying**: Use Prolog's query system to solve for `FinalMarbles` using the initial conditions (initial marbles, found marbles, and lost marbles).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate Josh's final marble collection\nmarble_collection(InitialMarbles, FoundMarbles, LostMarbles, FinalMarbles) :-\n    NetChange is FoundMarbles - LostMarbles,\n    FinalMarbles is InitialMarbles + NetChange.\n\n% Example query to find out Josh's current marble collection\n% Given initial marbles as 22, found marbles as 13, and lost marbles as 5\n?- marble_collection(22, 13, 5, FinalMarbles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial and final marble counts based on the given data.

With the given information about Steven's peach count, we can find the number of peaches Steven has in relation to Jake, and then use that to calculate Jill's count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into logical steps:\n\n1. Steven has 19 peaches.\n2. Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill. We can represent Jill's peaches as a variable, say `JillPeaches`. Steven's peaches can be expressed as `JillPeaches + 13`.\n3.

So, Steven has 18 peaches more than Jake, represented as `JillPeaches + 13 + 18`.\n\nNow, we need to find a way to eliminate the reference to Jake, as he doesn't have a direct relationship with Jill's peach count.\n\n4. Subtracting the number of peaches Jake has from Steven's count won't help us directly, but subtracting 18 from Steven's count will get us closer to the answer, as it undoes the difference between Steven and Jake.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to establish a relationship between the known facts and find Jill's peaches.

Since Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill, set `steven_peaches` as `jill_peaches_diff + 13`.\n3. Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven, so subtract 18 from `steven_peaches` to get the relationship between Steven and Jake.\n4. Now, set `jill_peaches` equal to `jill_peaches_diff` to simplify the equation, as we seek Jill's actual peach count.\n5.

Identify the number of action figures that can fit on one shelf: 10 action figures.\n2. Identify the number of action figures that can fit in Adam's room: 8 action figures.\n3. Determine the total number of shelves required by dividing the number of action figures in the room by the figures per shelf.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this problem in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total number of shelves needed based on the number of action figures that can fit on one shelf and the total action figures that can fit in the room. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_shelves` that takes three variables: `FiguresPerShelf`, `TotalFiguresInRoom`, and `TotalShelves`.\n2. Calculate the total number of shelves required by dividing `TotalFiguresInRoom` by `FiguresPerShelf`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of shelves (`TotalShelves`) given the known figures per shelf and the total figures that can fit in the room.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of shelves\ncalculate_shelves(FiguresPerShelf, TotalFiguresInRoom, TotalShelves) :-\n    TotalShelves is ceil(TotalFiguresInRoom / FiguresPerShelf).\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of shelves in Adam's room\n% Given action figures per shelf as 10 and total figures that can fit in the room as 8\n?- calculate_shelves(10, 8, TotalShelves).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the figures per shelf, the total figures in the room, and the number of shelves required.

The task is to find out how many more cups of sugar are needed compared to the cups of flour.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. **Ingredients Required**: The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour.\n2. **Partial Addition**: Mary has already added 11 cups of flour.\n3. **Calculation**: We need to find the difference between the required sugar and the remaining cups of flour (14 - 11 cups). \n4. **Conclusion**: The positive difference, if any, represents the additional cups of sugar needed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the difference between the required sugar and the remaining flour based on the partial addition of flour. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `cake_recipe` that accepts four parameters: `SugarCups`, `FlourCups`, `AddedFlourCups`, and `DifferenceCups`.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Flour**: Subtract the partial addition of flour (`AddedFlourCups`) from the total required flour (`FlourCups`).\n3. **Calculate the Difference**: Determine the difference between the required sugar and the remaining flour by subtracting the result from step 2 from the required sugar (`SugarCups`). If the result is negative, it means we have added too much flour.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the difference between the cups of sugar and flour needed, given the initial recipe requirements and the partial flour addition.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between sugar and flour requirements\ncake_recipe(SugarCups, FlourCups, AddedFlourCups, DifferenceCups) :-\n    RemainingFlour is FlourCups - AddedFlourCups,\n    DifferenceCups is SugarCups - RemainingFlour.\n\n% Example query to find out the difference\n% Given the recipe requirements and partial flour addition\n?- cake_recipe(5, 14, 11, DifferenceCups).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the recipe's original sugar and flour requirements, the partial flour addition, and the resulting difference.

Here's the step-by-step plan for creating the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `calculate_time` with four variables: `YesterdaysShirts`, `TodaysShirts`, `ProductionRate`, and `TotalTime`.\n2. **Total Production**: Calculate the total number of shirts produced by summing `YesterdaysShirts` and `TodaysShirts`.\n3. **Time Estimate**: Divide the total number of shirts by the production rate (`ProductionRate`) to estimate the total time in minutes.\n4. **Querying the Rule**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the total time the machine worked, given the number of shirts produced on two days and the production rate.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total time the machine worked\ncalculate_time(YesterdaysShirts, TodaysShirts, ProductionRate, TotalTime) :-\n    TotalProduction is YesterdaysShirts + TodaysShirts,\n    TotalTime is TotalProduction / ProductionRate.\n\n% Example query to find the total time the machine worked\n% Given shirts produced yesterday as 4, today as 8, and production rate as 3 shirts/minute\n?- calculate_time(4, 8, 3, TotalTime).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the number of shirts produced and the time taken, allowing us to compute the total time the machine worked based on the provided data.",

Then, Jessica added some more roses from her garden, bringing the total to 17 roses in the vase. The difference in the number of roses before and after the throwing away process will give us the number of roses she cut from her garden.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves a series of additions and can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1.

He started with 110 crayons, gave away a substantial number to his friends, and unfortunately lost even more. We need to find the difference between the crayons he lost and those he gave away.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into simple mathematical steps:\n\n1. **Initial Crayons**: Paul started with a grand total of 110 crayons.\n2. **Crayons Given**: Paul gave 90 crayons to his friends, which is a substantial portion of his birthday haul.\n3. **Crayons Lost**: In the course of the school year, Paul lost a whopping 412 crayons, which is a significant misfortune.\n4. **Calculation**: To find out how many more crayons Paul lost than he gave to his friends, we need to subtract the crayons given from the crayons lost.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the difference between the lost and given crayons, providing a clear logic flow. Here's the step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Start by defining a rule named `crayon_difference` with four variables: `InitialCrayons`, `CrayonsGiven`, `CrayonsLost`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Compute the Difference**: Inside the rule, calculate the `Difference` by subtracting `CrayonsGiven` from `CrayonsLost`.\n3. **Query Time**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the difference between the crayons lost and those given to friends, given the initial count and the counts of crayons given and lost.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between crayons lost and those given to friends\ncrayon_difference(InitialCrayons, CrayonsGiven, CrayonsLost, Difference) :-\n    Difference is CrayonsLost - CrayonsGiven.\n\n% Example query to find the crayon difference\n% Based on the initial crayons, crayons given, and crayons lost\n?- crayon_difference(110, 90, 412, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial crayon count, the number given away, the number lost, and the resulting difference.

We need to find the number of peaches Jill has, which is Steven's count minus 14, and then subtract another 7 to find Jake's peach count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that calculates Jake's peach count based on the information given. Here's the step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule with four variables: `StevenPeaches`, `JillPeaches`, `JakePeaches`, and `Difference`. We will use this rule to calculate the number of peaches each person has.\n2. **Relationships**: Inside the rule, subtract 14 from `StevenPeaches` to find `JillPeaches`. Further, subtract 7 from this value to determine `JakePeaches`.\n3. **Query**: Use a Prolog query to find Jake's peaches by providing the known facts: Steven has 15 peaches, and Jake has 7 fewer than Steven.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate Jake's peaches\npeach_count(StevenPeaches, JillPeaches, JakePeaches) :-\n    JillPeaches is StevenPeaches - 14,\n    JakePeaches is JillPeaches - 7.\n\n% Example query to find out how many peaches Jake has\n% Given Steven has 15 peaches\n?- peach_count(15, _, JakePeaches).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationships between the characters and the number of peaches they have.

Here's the step-by-step plan to create the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `peaches_per_basket` with two variables representing the number of red and green peaches and another variable for the total peaches in one basket.\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Use the `is` keyword in Prolog to perform the addition of the number of red and green peaches, thereby finding the total number of peaches.\n3. **Query**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of peaches in one basket by providing the numbers of red and green peaches.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of peaches in each basket\npeaches_per_basket(RedPeaches, GreenPeaches, TotalPeaches) :-\n    TotalPeaches is RedPeaches + GreenPeaches.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of peaches in each basket\n% Given 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches\n?- peaches_per_basket(7, 3, TotalPeaches).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a straightforward relationship to compute the total number of peaches in each basket. Running the query will return the answer based on the given information.",

Identify the number of bird families that arrived from the Arctic: 24 bird families.\n4. Calculate the net change by subtracting the number of departing bird families from the initial count, and then adding the number of arriving bird families: \\((49 - 59) + 24\\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that captures the changes in the number of bird families near the mountain. Here's the step-by-step plan to create the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `bird_migration` that takes four variables: `InitialFamilies`, `DepartingFamilies`, `ArrivingFamilies`, and `FinalFamilies`.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to express the relationship between these variables: the net change is calculated by subtracting `DepartingFamilies` from `InitialFamilies`, and then adding `ArrivingFamilies` to this result.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find the final number of bird families (`FinalFamilies`) based on the given initial count, departing families, and arriving families.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the net change in bird families near the mountain\nbird_migration(InitialFamilies, DepartingFamilies, ArrivingFamilies, FinalFamilies) :-\n    NetChange is (InitialFamilies - DepartingFamilies) + ArrivingFamilies,\n    FinalFamilies is InitialFamilies + NetChange.\n\n% Example query to determine the number of bird families left near the mountain\n% Given initial families as 49, departing families as 59, and arriving families as 24\n?- bird_migration(49, 59, 24, FinalFamilies).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the migration pattern and computes the final number of bird families near the mountain.

He initially has 440 crayons, gives away 111 crayons, and also loses 106 crayons. The final count of crayons can be found by appropriately accounting for these transactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. **Initial Stock**: Paul starts with a box of 440 crayons.\n2. **Crayons Given**: He gives away 111 crayons to his friends, reducing his stock.\n3. **Crayons Lost**: Unfortunately, he also loses 106 crayons, further diminishing his collection.\n4. **Final Count**: To find the final count of crayons, we must subtract the lost crayons from the adjusted initial stock (after giving some away).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the number of crayons remaining based on these transactions. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Start by defining a rule named `remaining_crayons` with four variables: `InitialCrayons`, `CrayonsGiven`, `CrayonsLost`, and `RemainingCrayons`.\n2. **Adjusted Initial Stock**: Inside the rule, calculate the adjusted initial number of crayons after accounting for the crayons given to friends. This is done by subtracting `CrayonsGiven` from `InitialCrayons`.\n3. **Final Calculation**: Further subtract the number of `CrayonsLost` from the adjusted initial stock to determine the `RemainingCrayons`.\n4. **Query with Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the remaining crayons by providing the relevant details (initial crayons, crayons given, crayons lost).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining crayons\nremaining_crayons(InitialCrayons, CrayonsGiven, CrayonsLost, RemainingCrayons) :-\n    AdjustedInitial is InitialCrayons - CrayonsGiven,\n    RemainingCrayons is AdjustedInitial - CrayonsLost.\n\n% Example query to find Paul's remaining crayons\n% Based on his initial 440 crayons, 111 given away, and 106 lost\n?- remaining_crayons(440, 111, 106, RemainingCrayons).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial and final crayon counts based on the transactions described in the problem.

To find the total number of marbles Josh has now, we simply need to add the newly found marbles to his initial collection.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved using basic arithmetic:\n\n1. Identify Josh's initial number of marbles: 21 marbles.\n2. Identify the number of marbles he found: 7 marbles.\n3. The final number of marbles can be obtained by adding the found marbles to the initial collection.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog, we'll establish a straightforward rule that links the initial number of marbles, the discovered marbles, and the ultimate count of marbles. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_marbles` that accepts three variables: `InitialMarbles`, `FoundMarbles`, and `FinalMarbles`.\n2. **Calculate Final Count**: The final number of marbles is obtained by adding `FoundMarbles` to `InitialMarbles`.\n3. **Use Prolog's Querying**: Utilize Prolog's querying features to compute the final number of marbles, given the initial count and the newly found marbles.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of marbles\ntotal_marbles(InitialMarbles, FoundMarbles, FinalMarbles) :-\n    FinalMarbles is InitialMarbles + FoundMarbles.\n\n% Example query to determine Josh's current marble collection\n% Based on his initial marbles (21) and the found marbles (7)\n?- total_marbles(21, 7, FinalMarbles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial and final marble counts, and the query at the end retrieves the answer when executed in a Prolog environment.",

Here's the step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `edwards_initial_money` with four variables: `books_bought`, `current_money`, `price_per_book`, and `initial_money`.\n2. **Calculate Price per Book**: Divide the total amount spent (`initial_money`) by the number of books bought (`books_bought`) to find the `price_per_book`.\n3. **Calculate Total Spent**: Multiply the `price_per_book` by the number of books bought to find the `total_spent`.\n4. **Find Initial Amount**: Subtract the `total_spent` from the `current_money` to determine Edward's `initial_money`.\n5. **Query with Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying system to find the answer by providing the number of books bought and Edward's current money.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate Edward's initial amount of money\nedwards_initial_money(BooksBought, CurrentMoney, InitialMoney) :-\n    PricePerBook is InitialMoney / BooksBought,\n    TotalSpent is BooksBought * PricePerBook,\n    InitialMoney2 is CurrentMoney - TotalSpent,\n    InitialMoney = InitialMoney2.\n\n% Query to find Edward's initial amount\n% Assuming he bought 92 books and now has $6 left\n?- edwards_initial_money(92, 6, InitialMoney).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a logical relationship to compute Edward's initial money.

The task is to determine the total number of pencils Faye has.

On one day, there were 100 visitors, and on the other day (referred to as the 'said day'), there were 666 visitors. We aim to find out the excess visitors on the 'said day'.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using a simple arithmetic operation:\n\n1. Identify the number of visitors on the previous day: 100 visitors.\n2. Identify the number of visitors on the said day: 666 visitors.\n3. Find the difference between the two counts to determine the excess visitors on the said day.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that computes the difference in visitor counts based on the data for two consecutive days. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `excess_visitors` with four variables: `PreviousDayVisitors`, `SaidDayVisitors`, `PreviousDay`, and `ExcessVisitors`.\n2. The excess visitors can be calculated by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the said day.\n3.

Since Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug before the loss, we can calculate Doug's initial marbles as 12 less than Ed's initial count (17), which gives us `InitialDougMarbles`.\n3. Doug gains 12 marbles when Ed loses some. So, Doug's final marble count is two more than Ed's remaining count after the loss.\n4. Use Prolog's query system to find the solution for `doug_marbles` based on the known initial conditions.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate Doug's marble count\ndoug_s_marbles(EdRemainingMarbles, DougMarbles) :-\n    InitialDougMarbles is 17 - 12,\n    DougMarbles is EdRemainingMarbles + 12.\n\n% Query to find Doug's current marble count\n% Based on Ed having 17 marbles left after the loss\n?- doug_s_marbles(17, DougMarbles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between Ed's and Doug's marble counts and calculates Doug's marbles using the given information.

Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `cake_ingredients`**: This rule will accept four variables: `InitialFlour`, `TotalFlour`, `SugarCups`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate remaining flour**: Use an arithmetic operation to find out how many more cups of flour are needed by subtracting the initial flour from the total flour requirement.\n3. **Compare with sugar requirement**: Determine whether Mary needs more flour or sugar by comparing the remaining flour with the sugar cups required.\n4. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query to find the answer using the provided initial flour amount, total flour requirement, and sugar cups requirement.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in cups and whether it's more flour or sugar needed\ncake_ingredients(InitialFlour, TotalFlour, SugarCups, Difference) :-\n    RemainingFlour is TotalFlour - InitialFlour,\n    (   RemainingFlour > SugarCups -> more_flour\n    ;   RemainingFlour =< SugarCups -> more_sugar\n    ).\n\n% Example query for Mary's cake ingredients\n% Given initial flour as 4 cups, total flour as 14 cups, and sugar as 9 cups\n?- cake_ingredients(4, 14, 9, Difference), more_flour(Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code will not only provide the numerical difference but also indicate whether Mary needs to add more flour or sugar to reach the recipe's requirements.

Initially, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 marbles at the playground, while Ed found 9 marbles. To find the net difference in their marble counts after these events, we need to consider the changes for both individuals.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial difference in marble counts between Ed and Doug: 24 marbles (Ed having 24 more).\n2. Account for Doug's loss: Subtract 27 marbles from Doug's initial count (the number of marbles Doug lost).\n3. Account for Ed's gain: Add 9 marbles to Ed's initial count (the number of marbles Ed found).\n4. Calculate the new difference in marble counts between Ed and Doug.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that captures the changes in marble counts and computes the final difference. Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `marble_difference` with four variables: `InitialEdMarbles`, `InitialDougMarbles`, `DougLostMarbles`, and `EdFoundMarbles`, representing the initial marble counts for Ed and Doug, the number of marbles Doug lost, and the number of marbles Ed found.\n2. Inside the rule, calculate the new marble counts for both Ed and Doug after the events. For Doug, subtract the marbles lost. For Ed, add the marbles found.\n3. Calculate the new difference in marble counts and return this value.\n4. Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the final difference in marble counts given the initial conditions and the number of marbles lost and found.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in marble counts between Ed and Doug\nmarble_difference(InitialEdMarbles, InitialDougMarbles, DougLostMarbles, EdFoundMarbles, FinalDifference) :-\n    NewDougMarbles is InitialDougMarbles - DougLostMarbles,\n    NewEdMarbles is InitialEdMarbles + EdFoundMarbles,\n    FinalDifference is NewEdMarbles - NewDougMarbles.\n\n% Example query to find the final difference in marble counts\n% Given initial counts, lost marbles, and found marbles\n?- marble_difference(x, y, 27, 9, FinalDiff).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the changes in marble counts and computes the final difference.

If `LeftoverPencils` is not 0 (or the remainder is not 0), then the number of rows should be adjusted downward.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the number of rows that can be formed, given the total number of pencils and pencils per row.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of rows Faye can make\npencils_in_rows(TotalPencils, PencilsPerRow, LeftoverPencils) :-\n    LeftoverPencils =:= 0 -> NumberOfRows is TotalPencils // PencilsPerRow\n                                       ; NumberOfRows is TotalPencils // PencilsPerRow - 1.\n                                       ; LeftoverPencils is mod(TotalPencils, PencilsPerRow).\n\n% Example query to find out how many rows Faye can make\n% Given 35 pencils and 5 pencils per row\n?- pencils_in_rows(35, 5, Leftover).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code considers both the number of pencils available and the desired pencils per row to compute the number of rows Faye can form, while also ensuring that there are no partial rows left behind.

Here's the Prolog code plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `doug_s_marbles` with four variables: `EdMarbles`, `DougLessEd`, `LostMarblesDoug`, and `DougMarblesNow`.\n2. **Calculate Doug's Initial Marbles**: Subtract `DougLessEd` from `EdMarbles` to determine Doug's starting number of marbles.\n3. **Find Remaining Marbles**: Subtract `LostMarblesDoug` from Doug's initial number of marbles to find the number of marbles he has now.\n4. **Prolog Query**: Use Prolog's querying features to find Doug's current marble count by providing the relevant initial conditions.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of marbles Doug has now\ndoug_s_marbles(EdMarbles, DougLessEd, LostMarblesDoug, DougMarblesNow) :-\n    DougInitial is EdMarbles - DougLessEd,\n    DougMarblesNow is DougInitial - LostMarblesDoug.\n\n% Example query to find out how many marbles Doug has now\n% Given Ed's marbles as 22, Doug having 6 less than Ed, and Doug's lost marbles as 7\n?- doug_s_marbles(22, 6, 7, DougMarblesNow).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the marble counts and computes Doug's remaining marbles.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to find out the difference between the number of roses Jessica threw away and the number of new roses she cut from her garden. Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses, which is the number of roses we know she removed. After that, she added some new roses, and the final count in the vase was 15 roses. To solve the problem, we need to calculate the difference between the roses thrown away and the roses cut from the garden.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into arithmetic steps:\n\n1. We know the initial number of roses in the vase: 21 roses.\n2. We know the number of roses thrown away: 34 roses.\n3. We need to determine the number of new roses cut from the garden. This number is the difference between the roses thrown away and the final number of roses in the vase: \\( 34 - 15 \\).\n4. The number of roses Jessica cut from the garden is the difference between the roses thrown away and the roses she added.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to write a rule that computes the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden based on the initial and final counts of roses in the vase, and the number of roses thrown away. Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `cut_roses` with four variables: `InitialRoses`, `RosesThrownAway`, `FinalRoses`, and `GardenRoses`.\n2. The number of roses thrown away is already known, which is `RosesThrownAway`.\n3. The final number of roses is the difference obtained from subtracting the `GardenRoses` from the `RosesThrownAway`.\n4. We will use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the solution for `GardenRoses` by providing the initial and final rose counts, and the number of roses thrown away.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of roses cut from the garden\ncut_roses(InitialRoses, RosesThrownAway, FinalRoses, GardenRoses) :-\n    GardenRoses is RosesThrownAway - FinalRoses.\n\n% Example query to find out the difference between thrown away roses and garden roses\n% Given initial roses as 21, roses thrown away as 34, and final roses as 15\n?- cut_roses(21, 34, 15, GardenRoses).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial, final, and thrown away roses, and computes the number of roses cut from the garden.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task is to calculate the total amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season after earning a weekly income and considering the tax he needs to pay. Lewis earns $21 every week during the 216 weeks of harvest. He also needs to pay a tax amount of $702. The goal is to find the net amount of money Lewis will have left after the harvest season.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings: Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks to find Lewis's total income over the harvest season.\n2. Subtract the tax: Subtract the tax amount of $702 from the total earnings to determine the net amount Lewis will have after paying the tax.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll define a rule in SWI-Prolog that computes the final amount of money using the given weekly earnings, the number of weeks, and the tax amount. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `harvest_earnings` that takes three variables: `WeeklyEarnings`, `Weeks`, `TaxAmount`, and `FinalAmount`.\n2. Calculate the total earnings over the harvest season by multiplying `WeeklyEarnings` and `Weeks`.\n3. Subtract the `TaxAmount` from the total earnings to find the `FinalAmount` that Lewis will have after paying the tax.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task is to determine the quantities of tomatoes and potatoes the farmer has left after picking some tomatoes from his garden. Initially, he had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes. After picking 53 tomatoes, we need to calculate the new quantities of both tomatoes and potatoes left in the garden.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of tomatoes: 177 tomatoes.\n2. Identify the initial number of potatoes: 12 potatoes.\n3. Identify the number of tomatoes picked: 53 tomatoes.\n4. Subtract the picked tomatoes from the initial tomato count to find the remaining tomatoes.\n5. The number of potatoes remains the same, as they weren't picked.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we'll define a rule that considers the initial amounts of tomatoes and potatoes, as well as the number of tomatoes picked, to determine the final quantities. Here's the step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `garden_harvest` that takes four variables: `InitialTomatoes`, `InitialPotatoes`, `PickedTomatoes`, and `FinalTomatoes`, and `FinalPotatoes`.\n2. Subtract the number of picked tomatoes from the initial tomato count to find the remaining tomatoes.\n3. Set the final number of potatoes equal to the initial number, as they aren't affected by the tomato picking.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find the final quantities of tomatoes and potatoes by providing the initial counts and the number of tomatoes picked.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining produce in the garden\ngarden_harvest(InitialTomatoes, InitialPotatoes, PickedTomatoes, FinalTomatoes, FinalPotatoes) :-\n    FinalTomatoes is InitialTomatoes - PickedTomatoes,\n    FinalPotatoes is InitialPotatoes.\n\n% Example query to determine the remaining produce\n% Given initial tomatoes as 177, initial potatoes as 12, and picked tomatoes as 53\n?- garden_harvest(177, 12, 53, FinalTomatoes, FinalPotatoes).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial state of the garden, the picking of tomatoes, and the final state.

We need to find the total number of bird families before the migration, which is the sum of the above two.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to write a rule that calculates the initial number of bird families based on the number that stayed and the number that flew away. Here's the step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule named `bird_families` with four variables: `FamiliesStayed`, `FamiliesFlewAway`, `InitialFamilies`, and `TotalFamilies`.\n2. The initial number of families, `InitialFamilies`, is the sum of `FamiliesStayed` and `FamiliesFlewAway`.\n3. `TotalFamilies` is equal to `InitialFamilies`, because the problem statement mentions that the families that stayed behind represent the ones who didn't migrate, implying that they were part of the original group.\n4. Use a Prolog query to solve for `InitialFamilies` given the number of families that stayed behind and the number that flew away.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the initial number of bird families\nbird_families(FamiliesStayed, FamiliesFlewAway, InitialFamilies, TotalFamilies) :-\n    InitialFamilies is FamiliesStayed + FamiliesFlewAway,\n    TotalFamilies is InitialFamilies.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of bird families initially\n% Given families stayed behind as 14 and families flew away as 20\n?- bird_families(14, 20, InitialFamilies, _).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up a relationship between the initial number of bird families and the number of families that stayed or flew away.

David's performance is also mentioned: he did 36 more push-ups and 33 fewer crunches than Zachary. To find the difference in favor of push-ups for Zachary, we need to calculate the push-up gap between the two students and then subtract the crunches gap.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into steps:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley has a certain number of boys in her class who love playing marbles. She wants to give each of these boys 5 marbles. By dividing the total number of marbles Haley has (10 marbles) by the number of marbles given to each boy, we can find out how many boys she gave marbles to.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into simple steps:\n\n1. Haley has 10 marbles to distribute among the boys.\n2. Each boy receives 5 marbles.\n3. To find the number of boys, we need to divide the total number of marbles by the number of marbles given to one boy.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that computes the number of boys based on the total marbles and the marbles given to each boy. Here's the step-by-step plan for creating the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `number_of_boys`**: This rule will take two arguments--`TotalMarbles` and `MarblesPerBoy`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's division operator (`//`) to divide the `TotalMarbles` by `MarblesPerBoy`. The integer result will be the number of boys.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will craft a query using this rule to determine the number of boys Haley gave marbles to, given the total marbles and marbles per boy.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of boys in Haley's class\nnumber_of_boys(TotalMarbles, MarblesPerBoy, NumberOfBoys) :-\n    NumberOfBoys is TotalMarbles // MarblesPerBoy.\n\n% Example query to find out how many boys received marbles\n% Given total marbles as 10 and marbles given to each boy as 5\n?- number_of_boys(10, 5, NumberOfBoys).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship and computes the number of boys in Haley's class based on the given total marbles and marbles given to each boy.

Lewis earns a fixed amount of $28 every week during the harvest season, which spans 1091 weeks. Additionally, he earns $939 per week for working overtime, and he works overtime every week. The total earnings during the harvest season will be the sum of these weekly earnings over the entire season.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem requires us to perform the following calculations:\n\n1.

        "question": "The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the frog jump?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we need to determine how far the frog jumped in the jumping contest after learning that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches and 2 inches farther than the frog. We will use this information to calculate the frog's jumping distance.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into logical steps:\n\n1. The grasshopper's jump length is known: 13 inches.\n2. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches more than the frog. We can represent the frog's jump as 13 - 2 = 11 inches.\n3. Subtracting the frog's jump from the grasshopper's jump gives us the difference in their performances.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we'll set up a rule that takes into account the known jump length of the grasshopper and calculates the jump length of the frog. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `frog_jump` that takes two variables: `GrasshopperJump` and `FrogJump`.\n2. Since the grasshopper jumped 2 inches more than the frog, we can express the frog's jump as `FrogJump` = `GrasshopperJump` - 2.\n3. Use Prolog's querying system to find out the frog's jump distance by inputting the grasshopper's jump distance.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the frog's jump distance\nfrog_jump(GrasshopperJump, FrogJump) :-\n    FrogJump is GrasshopperJump - 2.\n\n% Example query to find the frog's jump distance\n% Given the grasshopper jumped 13 inches\n?- frog_jump(13, FrogJump).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses the defined relationship to compute the frog's jump distance when given the grasshopper's jump length. The query provided will return the answer when executed in a Prolog environment.",
