Identify the total number of action figures on the shelf now: 6 action figures.\n4. Calculate the sum of the initial number and the number added: \\(3 + 4\\).\n5. Subtract the total number of action figures on the shelf from the sum calculated in step 4 to find the number removed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial number of action figures, the number added, the total number on the shelf, and the number removed. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `removed_action_figures` that takes four variables: `InitialFigures`, `AddedFigures`, `TotalFigures`, and `RemovedFigures`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the sum of the initial and added figures is the total on the shelf, and the removed figures are the difference between the total and the initial sum.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `RemovedFigures` given the initial, added, and total numbers of action figures.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of action figures removed\nremoved_action_figures(InitialFigures, AddedFigures, TotalFigures, RemovedFigures) :-\n    InitialSum is InitialFigures + AddedFigures,\n    RemovedFigures is InitialSum - TotalFigures.\n\n% Example query to find out how many action figures Jerry removed from the shelf\n% Given initial figures as 3, added figures as 4, and total figures as 6\n?- removed_action_figures(3, 4, 6, RemovedFigures).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the number of action figures removed from the shelf based on the given initial, added, and total counts.

If there are 26 bags with an equal number of cookies in each bag, and the total number of cookies and candies is given, we can calculate the number of cookies in each bag.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by setting up an equation based on the information provided:\n\n1. Let the number of cookies in each bag be represented by `X`.\n2. The total number of cookies is 52, and the total number of candies is 15.\n3. Since there are 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies can be expressed as `26 * X`.\n4.

In this case, each necklace requires 8 beads, and Emily has 16 beads. By dividing the total number of beads by the number of beads required for each necklace, we can find out how many necklaces Emily can make.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by dividing the total number of beads Emily has by the number of beads required for each necklace. This division will give us the maximum number of necklaces Emily can make with the given number of beads.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a rule that calculates the number of necklaces Emily can make based on the total number of beads she has and the number of beads required for each necklace.

        "question": "Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week, how much money will have at the end of the harvest season?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we need to calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season after earning a certain amount each week and paying rent. Lewis earns $491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest and has to pay $216 in rent each week. To find out how much money he will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings and subtract his total rent payments.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify Lewis's weekly earnings: $491.\n2. Identify the number of weeks in the harvest season: 1181 weeks.\n3. Identify Lewis's weekly rent payment: $216.\n4. Calculate Lewis's total earnings during the harvest season: weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks.\n5. Calculate Lewis's total rent payments during the harvest season: weekly rent payment multiplied by the number of weeks.\n6. Subtract the total rent payments from the total earnings to find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a rule that captures the relationship between Lewis's weekly earnings, the number of weeks in the harvest season, his weekly rent payment, and the final amount of money he will have. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_end_amount` that takes four variables: `WeeklyEarnings`, `WeeksInHarvest`, `WeeklyRentPayment`, and `EndAmount`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total earnings during the harvest season is the product of `WeeklyEarnings` and `WeeksInHarvest`.\n3. The total rent payments during the harvest season is the product of `WeeklyRentPayment` and `WeeksInHarvest`.\n4. The final amount of money Lewis will have is the difference between the total earnings and the total rent payments.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `EndAmount` given the weekly earnings, the number of weeks, and the weekly rent payment.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season\ncalculate_end_amount(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksInHarvest, WeeklyRentPayment, EndAmount) :-\n    TotalEarnings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksInHarvest,\n    TotalRentPayments is WeeklyRentPayment * WeeksInHarvest,\n    EndAmount is TotalEarnings - TotalRentPayments.\n\n% Example query to find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season\n% Given weekly earnings as $491, weeks in harvest as 1181, and weekly rent payment as $216\n?- calculate_end_amount(491, 1181, 216, EndAmount).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the final amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season based on the given parameters.

Identify the number of books he had left after giving some to his friend: 68 books.\n4. Calculate the total number of books he had after giving some to his friend: \\( 134 - 39 \\).\n5. Subtract the number of books he had left from the total to find out how many books he sold in the garage sale.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial number of books, the number of books given away, the number of books left, and the number of books sold in the garage sale. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_books_sold` that takes four variables: `InitialBooks`, `BooksGivenAway`, `BooksLeft`, and `BooksSold`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total number of books after giving some away is the difference between the initial number and the number given away.\n3. The number of books sold in the garage sale is the difference between the total number of books and the number left.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `BooksSold` given the initial number of books, the number given away, and the number left.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of books sold in the garage sale\ncalculate_books_sold(InitialBooks, BooksGivenAway, BooksLeft, BooksSold) :-\n    TotalBooksAfterGivingAway is InitialBooks - BooksGivenAway,\n    BooksSold is TotalBooksAfterGivingAway - BooksLeft.\n\n% Example query to find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale\n% Given initial books as 134, books given away as 39, and books left as 68\n?- calculate_books_sold(134, 39, 68, BooksSold).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the number of books sold in the garage sale based on the given initial number of books, the number given away, and the number left.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTo determine the number of invitations left after Carol sends invitations to only 2 friends, we need to calculate the total number of invitations she initially had and then subtract the number of invitations sent to the friends.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by following these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of invitations Carol initially had by multiplying the number of invitations in each pack by the number of packs she bought.\n2. Determine the total number of invitations sent to the friends, which is the product of the number of friends and the number of invitations each friend receives.\n3. Subtract the total number of invitations sent from the initial total to find out how many invitations are left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of invitations left based on the initial count, the number of packs bought, the number of invitations per pack, and the number of friends receiving invitations. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `invitations_left` that accepts four parameters: `Packs`, `InvitationsPerPack`, `Friends`, and `InvitationsLeft`.\n2. **Calculate Total Invitations**: Multiply the number of packs by the number of invitations per pack to get the initial total.\n3. **Calculate Invitations Sent**: Multiply the number of friends by the number of invitations each friend receives.\n4. **Calculate Invitations Left**: Subtract the total invitations sent from the initial total to determine the remaining invitations.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the number of invitations left based on the given parameters.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of invitations left\ninvitations_left(Packs, InvitationsPerPack, Friends, InvitationsLeft) :-\n    TotalInvitations is Packs * InvitationsPerPack,\n    InvitationsSent is Friends * 2, % Each friend receives 2 invitations\n    InvitationsLeft is TotalInvitations - InvitationsSent.\n\n% Example query to find out how many invitations Carol will have left\n% Given 7 packs, 10 invitations per pack, and sending invitations to 2 friends\n?- invitations_left(7, 10, 2, InvitationsLeft).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the number of invitations left.

Calculate the difference between the number of campers in the morning and the number of campers in the afternoon.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference in the number of campers who went rowing in the morning compared to the afternoon. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `campers_difference` that takes three variables: `MorningCampers`, `AfternoonCampers`, and `Difference`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the difference is the result of subtracting `AfternoonCampers` from `MorningCampers`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `Difference` given the number of campers in the morning and the number of campers in the afternoon.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in the number of campers rowing in the morning and afternoon\ncampers_difference(MorningCampers, AfternoonCampers, Difference) :-\n    Difference is MorningCampers - AfternoonCampers.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon\n% Given campers in the morning as 44 and campers in the afternoon as 39\n?- campers_difference(44, 39, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the difference in the number of campers who went rowing in the morning compared to the afternoon.

Initially, Paul received a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 391 items left, with all the erasers still intact. To find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left, we need to calculate the difference between the number of crayons and erasers he had left.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1.

Identify the total area of the room: 10 square feet.\n2. Identify the length of the room: 5 feet.\n3. Use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width.\n4. Substitute the known values into the formula: 10 = 5 x Width.\n5.

        "question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe task involves determining the total number of flowers grown by Paige and her mom after planting a certain number of seeds. They planted a total of 55 seeds, with 15 seeds in each flower bed. However, only 60% of the seeds in each flower bed grew into flowers. The goal is to calculate the total number of flowers that grew from the planted seeds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:\n\n1. **Total Seeds Planted**: Paige and her mom planted a total of 55 seeds.\n2. **Seeds per Flower Bed**: They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.\n3. **Growth Rate**: Only 60% of the seeds in each flower bed grew into flowers.\n4. **Calculate Flowers per Flower Bed**: Multiply the number of seeds in each flower bed by the growth rate to find the number of flowers in each flower bed.\n5. **Total Flowers Grown**: Multiply the flowers per flower bed by the total number of flower beds to get the total number of flowers grown.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total number of flowers grown based on the number of seeds planted, seeds per flower bed, and the growth rate. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_flowers` that takes three parameters: `TotalSeeds`, `SeedsPerBed`, and `GrowthRate`.\n2. **Calculate Flowers per Bed**: Inside the rule, calculate the number of flowers that grew in each flower bed by multiplying the seeds per bed by the growth rate.\n3. **Calculate Total Flowers**: Multiply the flowers per bed by the total number of flower beds to determine the total number of flowers grown.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of flowers grown by providing the necessary input values.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of flowers grown\ntotal_flowers(TotalSeeds, SeedsPerBed, GrowthRate, TotalFlowers) :-\n    FlowersPerBed is SeedsPerBed * GrowthRate,\n    TotalFlowers is TotalSeeds // SeedsPerBed * FlowersPerBed.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of flowers grown\n% Given total seeds as 55, seeds per bed as 15, and growth rate as 0.6 (60%)\n?- total_flowers(55, 15, 0.6, TotalFlowers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet establishes the relationship between the input parameters and calculates the total number of flowers grown.
