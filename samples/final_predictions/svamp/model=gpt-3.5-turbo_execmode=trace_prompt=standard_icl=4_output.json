After planting, the total number of trees increased to 21. The difference between the final and initial number of trees will give us the number of trees planted on that day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Initial number of trees**: 15 trees.\n2. **Final number of trees after planting**: 21 trees.\n3. **Calculation**: The number of trees planted is the difference between the final number of trees and the initial number of trees.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of trees planted based on the initial and final counts. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `plant_trees`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialTrees`, `FinalTrees`, and `PlantedTrees`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the difference between `FinalTrees` and `InitialTrees`, which gives `PlantedTrees`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of trees planted given the initial and final counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of trees planted\nplant_trees(InitialTrees, FinalTrees, PlantedTrees) :-\n    PlantedTrees is FinalTrees - InitialTrees.\n\n% Example query to find out how many trees were planted today\n% Given initial trees as 15 and final trees as 21\n?- plant_trees(15, 21, PlantedTrees).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the initial and final tree counts and computes the number of trees planted.

Initially, there were 9 computers. Each day, from Monday to Thursday, 5 more computers were added.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_computers` that accepts four parameters: `InitialComputers`, `Days`, `ComputersPerDay`, and `FinalComputers`.\n2. **Calculate Total Added**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of computers added over the days as the product of `Days` and `ComputersPerDay`.\n3. **Calculate Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to derive the final count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the final number of computers by providing the initial conditions (initial count, number of days, and computers added per day).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of computers in the server room\ntotal_computers(InitialComputers, Days, ComputersPerDay, FinalComputers) :-\n    TotalAdded is Days * ComputersPerDay,\n    FinalComputers is InitialComputers + TotalAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of computers now in the server room\n% Given initial computers as 9, days as 4, and computers installed per day as 5\n?- total_computers(9, 4, 5, FinalComputers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

Calculate the number of apples that remained by subtracting the apples used from the initial count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that captures the relationship between the initial number of apples, the number used, and the number remaining. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_apples` that takes three variables: `InitialApples`, `UsedApples`, and `RemainingApples`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `RemainingApples` is the result of subtracting `UsedApples` from `InitialApples`.\n3. Utilize SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to determine the number of apples that remained after the chef used some to make pies.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of apples that remained\nremaining_apples(InitialApples, UsedApples, RemainingApples) :-\n    RemainingApples is InitialApples - UsedApples.\n\n% Query to find out how many apples remained\n% Given initial apples as 58 and apples used as 35\n?- remaining_apples(58, 35, RemainingApples).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship and computes the number of apples that remained based on the initial count and the number used.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_apples_picked` that takes three parameters: `Trees`, `ApplesPerTree`, and `TotalPicked`.\n2. **Calculate Total Picked**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of apples picked by multiplying the number of trees by the apples picked per tree and subtracting the remaining apples.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Utilize Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of apples picked by Rachel.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of apples picked by Rachel\ntotal_apples_picked(Trees, ApplesPerTree, TotalPicked) :-\n    RemainingApples is Trees * ApplesPerTree - 29,\n    TotalPicked is Trees * ApplesPerTree - RemainingApples.\n\n% Example query to find out how many apples Rachel picked in total\n% Given 4 apple trees and 7 apples picked per tree\n?- total_apples_picked(4, 7, TotalPicked).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the total number of apples picked by Rachel.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given the total number of pages of math, reading, and biology homework that Rachel had to complete. We need to determine the number of pages of reading and biology homework she had to complete. To find this, we will subtract the number of pages of math homework from the total number of pages she had to complete, which will give us the combined number of pages for reading and biology homework.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by following these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of pages of math homework: 5 pages.\n2. Identify the total number of pages of reading homework: 10 pages.\n3. Identify the additional pages of biology homework: 6 pages.\n4. Calculate the total number of pages Rachel had to complete: \\(5 + 10 + 6\\).\n5. Subtract the number of pages of math homework from the total to find the combined number of pages for reading and biology homework.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total number of pages of reading and biology homework based on the given data. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `homework_pages` that takes four variables: `MathPages`, `ReadingPages`, `BiologyPages`, and `TotalPages`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total number of pages is the sum of math, reading, and biology pages.\n3. Subtract the number of math pages from the total to find the combined number of reading and biology pages.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for the combined number of reading and biology pages given the individual homework page counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the combined number of reading and biology homework pages\nhomework_pages(MathPages, ReadingPages, BiologyPages, TotalPages) :-\n    TotalPages is MathPages + ReadingPages + BiologyPages,\n    ReadingBiologyPages is TotalPages - MathPages.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of reading and biology homework pages Rachel had to complete\n% Given math pages as 5, reading pages as 10, and biology pages as 6\n?- homework_pages(5, 10, 6, ReadingBiologyPages).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the homework page counts and calculates the combined number of reading and biology homework pages.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `marbles_difference` that takes three parameters: `InitialMarbles`, `MarblesLost`, and `MarblesFound`.\n2. **Calculate Difference**: Inside the rule, subtract the number of marbles found from the number of marbles lost to determine the difference.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out how many more marbles Josh lost than those he found by providing the initial conditions.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between marbles lost and marbles found\nmarbles_difference(InitialMarbles, MarblesLost, MarblesFound, Difference) :-\n    Difference is MarblesLost - MarblesFound.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more marbles Josh lost than those he found\n% Given initial marbles as 4, marbles lost as 16, and marbles found as 8\n?- marbles_difference(4, 16, 8, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and calculates the difference between the marbles lost and the marbles found.

Calculate the total number of roses after the removal: \\(15 - 33\\).\n4. Identify the final number of roses in the vase: 17 roses.\n5. Calculate the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden: \\(17 - (15 - 33)\\).\n6. Determine the difference between the roses cut and those thrown away.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference between the roses cut and those thrown away. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `roses_difference` that takes four parameters: `InitialRoses`, `RosesThrownAway`, `FinalRoses`, and `Difference`.\n2. Calculate the total number of roses after the removal as the difference between the initial roses and those thrown away.\n3. Calculate the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden as the difference between the final roses and the total after removal.\n4. Calculate the difference between the roses cut and those thrown away.\n5. Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the difference between the roses cut and those thrown away.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between roses cut and those thrown away\nroses_difference(InitialRoses, RosesThrownAway, FinalRoses, Difference) :-\n    TotalAfterRemoval is InitialRoses - RosesThrownAway,\n    RosesCut is FinalRoses - TotalAfterRemoval,\n    Difference is RosesCut - RosesThrownAway.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away\n% Given initial roses as 15, roses thrown away as 33, and final roses as 17\n?- roses_difference(15, 33, 17, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

Given the number of visitors on the current day (705), the number of visitors on the previous day (191), and the number of visitors two days before (457), we need to calculate the difference in visitors between the current day and the previous 245 days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. Identify the number of visitors on the current day: 705 visitors.\n2. Identify the number of visitors on the previous day: 191 visitors.\n3. Identify the number of visitors two days before: 457 visitors.\n4. Calculate the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days: Sum of visitors in the previous 245 days.\n5.

Lewis earns $403 every week but has to pay $49 in rent each week. The goal is to determine the total amount of money he earns during the entire harvest season after accounting for rent.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Weekly Earnings**: Lewis earns $403 every week.\n2. **Weekly Rent**: Lewis pays $49 in rent every week.\n3. **Number of Weeks**: The harvest season lasts for 233 weeks.\n4. **Total Earnings**: Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the weekly earnings by the number of weeks.\n5. **Total Rent**: Calculate the total rent paid by multiplying the weekly rent by the number of weeks.\n6. **Net Earnings**: Subtract the total rent from the total earnings to find the net amount earned during the harvest season.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season after deducting his rent expenses. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `calculate_earnings` that accepts three parameters: `WeeklyEarnings`, `WeeklyRent`, and `TotalWeeks`.\n2. **Calculate Total Earnings**: Multiply the weekly earnings by the total number of weeks to get the total earnings.\n3. **Calculate Total Rent**: Multiply the weekly rent by the total number of weeks to get the total rent paid.\n4. **Calculate Net Earnings**: Subtract the total rent from the total earnings to find the net amount earned.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the net earnings during the harvest season by providing the necessary data.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the net earnings during the harvest season\ncalculate_earnings(WeeklyEarnings, WeeklyRent, TotalWeeks, NetEarnings) :-\n    TotalEarnings is WeeklyEarnings * TotalWeeks,\n    TotalRent is WeeklyRent * TotalWeeks,\n    NetEarnings is TotalEarnings - TotalRent.\n\n% Example query to find out how much money Lewis earns during the harvest season\n% Given weekly earnings as $403, weekly rent as $49, and total weeks as 233\n?- calculate_earnings(403, 49, 233, NetEarnings).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between Lewis's weekly earnings, rent expenses, and the total number of weeks during the harvest season.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `tshirts_per_package`**: This rule will take three arguments - `TotalPackages`, `TotalTshirts`, and `TshirtsPerPackage`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the division of `TotalTshirts` by `TotalPackages`, which gives `TshirtsPerPackage`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of t-shirts in each package given the total packages and total t-shirts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of t-shirts in each package\ntshirts_per_package(TotalPackages, TotalTshirts, TshirtsPerPackage) :-\n    TshirtsPerPackage is TotalTshirts / TotalPackages.\n\n% Example query to find out how many t-shirts are in each package\n% Given total packages as 28 and total t-shirts as 56\n?- tshirts_per_package(28, 56, TshirtsPerPackage).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a simple relationship between the total number of packages, total number of t-shirts, and the number of t-shirts in each package.

Calculate the number of crunches David did: 58 - 62.\n5. Determine the difference between the number of crunches and push-ups that Zachary did.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of crunches and push-ups that Zachary did. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `calculate_difference` that accepts two parameters: `PushUps` and `Crunches`.\n2. **Calculate David's Push-Ups and Crunches**: Calculate the number of push-ups and crunches David did based on the given information.\n3. **Calculate Zachary's Difference**: Calculate the difference between the number of crunches and push-ups that Zachary did.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between crunches and push-ups Zachary did\ncalculate_difference(PushUps, Crunches, Difference) :-\n    DavidPushUps is PushUps + 38,\n    DavidCrunches is Crunches - 62,\n    Difference is Crunches - PushUps.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did\n% Given Zachary's push-ups as 46 and crunches as 58\n?- calculate_difference(46, 58, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the number of push-ups and crunches that Zachary did and calculates the difference between them.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `remaining_bird_families`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialFamilies`, `FlewAwayFamilies`, and `RemainingFamilies`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the difference between `InitialFamilies` and `FlewAwayFamilies`, which gives `RemainingFamilies`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of bird families left near the mountain.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of bird families left near the mountain\nremaining_bird_families(InitialFamilies, FlewAwayFamilies, RemainingFamilies) :-\n    RemainingFamilies is InitialFamilies - FlewAwayFamilies.\n\n% Example query to find out how many bird families were left near the mountain\n% Given initial bird families as 41 and families that flew away as 27\n?- remaining_bird_families(41, 27, RemainingFamilies).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the initial count of bird families and the number that flew away, and computes the number of families left near the mountain.

Calculate the amount made per day: Total earnings divided by the number of days.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the amount made per day based on the total earnings and the number of days. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `earnings_per_day`**: This rule will take two arguments - `TotalEarnings` and `Days`, and calculate the amount made per day.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to divide the `TotalEarnings` by `Days` to get the earnings per day.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the amount made per day given the total earnings and the number of days.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the earnings per day\nearnings_per_day(TotalEarnings, Days, EarningsPerDay) :-\n    EarningsPerDay is TotalEarnings / Days.\n\n% Example query to find out how much money they made per day\n% Given total earnings as 165 dollars over 5 days\n?- earnings_per_day(165, 5, EarningsPerDay).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a rule to calculate the earnings per day and uses a query to find the answer based on the given data. Executing the query in a Prolog environment will provide the amount made per day at the ring toss game.",

The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar in total, and she has already added 4 cups. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs, we need to calculate the difference between the total required sugar and the sugar already added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Sugar Required**: The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar in total.\n2. **Sugar Already Added**: Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar.\n3. **Calculate Remaining Sugar**: Subtract the sugar already added from the total sugar required to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the remaining cups of sugar needed based on the total required sugar and the sugar already added. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `remaining_sugar` that takes three parameters: `TotalSugar`, `SugarAdded`, and `RemainingSugar`.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Sugar**: Inside the rule, subtract the `SugarAdded` from the `TotalSugar` to determine the remaining sugar needed.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add by providing the total required sugar and the sugar already added.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining cups of sugar needed\nremaining_sugar(TotalSugar, SugarAdded, RemainingSugar) :-\n    RemainingSugar is TotalSugar - SugarAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add\n% Given total sugar required as 7 cups and sugar already added as 4 cups\n?- remaining_sugar(7, 4, RemainingSugar).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the total required sugar, the sugar already added, and the remaining sugar needed.
