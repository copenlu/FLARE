Initially, there were 9 computers. Each day, from Monday to Thursday, 5 more computers were added.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_computers` that accepts four parameters: `InitialComputers`, `Days`, `ComputersPerDay`, and `FinalComputers`.\n2. **Calculate Total Added**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of computers added over the days as the product of `Days` and `ComputersPerDay`.\n3. **Calculate Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to derive the final count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the final number of computers by providing the initial conditions (initial count, number of days, and computers added per day).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of computers in the server room\ntotal_computers(InitialComputers, Days, ComputersPerDay, FinalComputers) :-\n    TotalAdded is Days * ComputersPerDay,\n    FinalComputers is InitialComputers + TotalAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of computers now in the server room\n% Given initial computers as 9, days as 4, and computers installed per day as 5\n?- total_computers(9, 4, 5, FinalComputers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome.

We know that Matthew had enough crackers to give 2 crackers to each of his friends. We'll call this initial number of crackers `X`.\n2.

Paco initially had 40 cookies, ate two of them, and then bought 37 more. The remaining cookies can be found by calculating the difference between the initial and final counts.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves basic arithmetic operations:\n\n1. **Initial Cookies**: Paco starts with 40 cookies.\n2. **Cookies Consumed**: Paco eats 2 cookies, reducing the count to 38.\n3. **Cookies Purchased**: Paco buys 37 more cookies, increasing the count.\n4. **Final Cookies**: To find the final count, we subtract the initial count (38) from the total after the purchase (37 is added to the initial count).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to create a rule that computes the number of cookies Paco has left based on the initial count, cookies consumed, and cookies purchased.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `bus_stop_difference` with four parameters: `InitialChildren`, `ChildrenExiting`, `UnknownChildrenOn`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Final Count Calculation**: The final number of children on the bus is obtained by adding the children who didn't exit (`InitialChildren - ChildrenExiting`) and the unknown number who got on (`UnknownChildrenOn`).\n3. **Net Change Calculation**: Subtract the initial number of children from the final count to determine the net change.\n4. **Difference Calculation**: Subtract the unknown number of children who got on from the net change to find the difference between children who got off and those who got on.\n5. **Query in Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying system to solve for `Difference` by providing the initial count, number of children exiting, and the final count.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between children getting off and on the bus\nbus_stop_difference(InitialChildren, ChildrenExiting, UnknownChildrenOn, Difference) :-\n    FinalChildren is (InitialChildren - ChildrenExiting) + UnknownChildrenOn,\n    NetChange is FinalChildren - InitialChildren,\n    Difference is NetChange - UnknownChildrenOn.\n\n% Query to find the difference\n% Given initial children as 36, children exiting as 68, and final count as 12\n?- bus_stop_difference(36, 68, UnknownOn, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the given data and the unknown number of children who got on the bus.

Here's the step-by-step plan for constructing the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `house_nails` with four variables: `LargePlanks`, `NailsPerLargePlank`, `SmallPlanksNails`, and `TotalNails`.\n2. **Calculate Nails for Large Planks**: Multiply the number of large planks by the nails required per large plank.\n3. **Add Nails for Small Planks**: Add the number of nails for the small planks to the previous calculation.\n4. **Query with Given Data**: Use Prolog's querying system to find the total nails required, given the number of large planks, nails per large plank, and the additional nails for small planks.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of nails needed for the house walls\nhouse_nails(LargePlanks, NailsPerLargePlank, SmallPlanksNails, TotalNails) :-\n    NailsForLargePlanks is LargePlanks * NailsPerLargePlank,\n    TotalNails is NailsForLargePlanks + SmallPlanksNails.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of nails John needs\n?- house_nails(13, 17, 8, TotalNails).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the given data and the total number of nails needed.

After losing some marbles, Ed now has only 8 more marbles than Doug. The difference in the number of marbles between these two scenarios will give us the count of marbles Ed lost.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into steps:\n\n1. **Initial Marble Difference**: Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. This implies that the difference in their marble counts is 19.\n2. **Final Marble Difference**: After Ed's loss, he now has 8 more marbles than Doug. This results in a change in the marble difference.\n3. **Lost Marbles**: The difference in the marble counts before and after Ed's loss represents the number of marbles he lost.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the number of marbles lost based on the initial and final marble differences. Here's the step-by-step plan for constructing the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Start by creating a rule named `lost_marbles` with four variables: `InitialDifference`, `FinalDifference`, and `LostMarbles`. These variables will represent the difference in marble counts between Ed and Doug at the initial and final stages, and the number of marbles lost, respectively.\n2. **Compute Lost Marbles**: Inside the rule, calculate the number of marbles lost by subtracting the final difference from the initial difference.\n3. **Query Execution**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the number of marbles lost by providing the initial and final difference values.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of marbles lost\nlost_marbles(InitialDifference, FinalDifference, LostMarbles) :-\n    LostMarbles is InitialDifference - FinalDifference.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of marbles Ed lost\n% Given the initial and final differences in marble counts\n?- lost_marbles(19, 8, LostMarbles).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial and final states of marble differences and computes the number of marbles lost.

Here's the step-by-step plan for creating the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `cut_roses`**: This rule should take three variables - `InitialRoses`, `FinalRoses`, and `CutRoses`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to find the difference between `FinalRoses` and `InitialRoses`, which represents the number of roses cut.\n3. **Querying the Prolog database**: We'll write a query to find out the number of roses cut, given the initial and final rose counts in the vase.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define a rule to calculate the number of roses cut\ncut_roses(InitialRoses, FinalRoses, CutRoses) :-\n    CutRoses is FinalRoses - InitialRoses.\n\n% Example query to find out the number of roses cut\n% Based on the initial and final rose counts in the vase\n?- cut_roses(7, 20, CutRoses).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial and final rose counts, and it can compute the number of roses cut.

The difference between the final and initial number of roses, along with the number of roses thrown away, will give us the number of roses Jessica cut.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves basic arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Initial number of roses**: There were 2 roses in the vase initially.\n2. **Roses thrown away**: 4 roses were removed from the vase.\n3. **Final number of roses**: After adding more roses, the count increased to 23.\n4. **Calculation**: The number of roses Jessica cut is the difference between the final and initial counts, minus the number of roses thrown away.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the number of roses cut based on the initial count, final count, and the number thrown away.

On their way back, Marco's dad found additional strawberries that weighed 30 pounds. To find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries, we need to subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight after the addition.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into logical steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial combined weight of strawberries: 22 pounds (collectively Marco and his dad's strawberries).\n2. Identify the weight of additional strawberries found: 30 pounds.\n3. After the addition of these strawberries, the total weight increased to 36 pounds (the weight of Marco's strawberries now).\n4.

We can subtract the number of crayons left to find the difference.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog, we'll define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of erasers and crayons left. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `eraser_crayon_difference` with four variables: `InitialCrayons`, `InitialErasers`, `CrayonsLeft`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate Crayons Lost**: Compute the number of crayons lost by subtracting `CrayonsLeft` from `InitialCrayons`.\n3. **Calculate Difference**: Subtract the number of crayons left from the initial number of erasers to find the difference.\n4. **Query in Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the difference between erasers and crayons left, given the initial counts and the final crayon count.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between erasers and crayons left\neraser_crayon_difference(InitialCrayons, InitialErasers, CrayonsLeft, Difference) :-\n    CrayonsLost is InitialCrayons - CrayonsLeft,\n    Difference is InitialErasers - CrayonsLeft.\n\n% Example query to find the difference\n% Given initial crayons as 601, initial erasers as 406, and crayons left as 336\n?- eraser_crayon_difference(601, 406, 336, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the initial and final states of Paul's crayons and erasers.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Josh started with a marble collection of 4 marbles. He experienced a loss of 16 marbles, which is quite unfortunate. However, he managed to find 8 new marbles. The task is to determine the difference between the number of marbles he lost and the number he found. This will give us an understanding of Josh's net gain or loss of marbles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial count of marbles: Josh began with 4 marbles.\n2. Account for the marbles he lost: Subtract 16 marbles from the initial count.\n3. Identify the number of marbles he found: Josh found 8 new marbles.\n4. Calculate the difference between the lost and found marbles. This will give us the net change in Josh's marble collection.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will establish a rule that computes the difference between the lost and found marbles based on the initial count and the number of marbles associated with both events (loss and finding).

The mailman has to give 25 pieces of junk mail to each block and 5 mails to each house within that block. We need to find out the number of houses.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can solve this problem by performing the following arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. Identify the total number of mails the mailman has to give to each block: 25 pieces of junk mail.\n2. Identify the number of mails given to each house: 5 mails.\n3. Calculate the number of houses by dividing the total mails for a block by the mails for each house.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to create a rule that establishes a relationship between the total mails for a block, mails per house, and the number of houses.

Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `ferris_wheel_capacity` with four variables: `seatsPerWheel`, `peoplePerSeat`, `numWheels`, and `totalPeople`.\n2. **Calculate Total Capacity**: Inside the rule, multiply `seatsPerWheel` by `peoplePerSeat` to find the capacity of a single Ferris wheel, and then multiply this by `numWheels` to find the total capacity.\n3. **Query with Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to solve for `totalPeople` by providing the appropriate initial values.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheels\nferris_wheel_capacity(seatsPerWheel, peoplePerSeat, numWheels, totalPeople) :-\n    capacityPerWheel is seatsPerWheel * peoplePerSeat,\n    totalPeople is numWheels * capacityPerWheel.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of people that can ride 20 Ferris wheels\n?- ferris_wheel_capacity(19, 15, 20, totalPeople).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the characteristics of the Ferris wheels and the total number of people they can hold.

Zachary's Push-ups: We don't know Zachary's individual count, but we'll represent it with a variable, say `ZacharyPushups`.\n2. David's Push-ups: Since David did 56 more than Zachary, his push-ups can be expressed as `ZacharyPushups + 56`.\n3.

The task is to determine how many more cups of flour she needs to add compared to the number of cups of sugar required. We need to calculate this difference to guide Mary's next steps in baking.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break this problem down into logical steps:\n\n1. **Ingredients**: The recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour in total.\n2. **Started Addition**: Mary has already started by adding 2 cups of flour.\n3. **Remaining Addition**: To determine the difference, we need to calculate the remaining flour and sugar requirements. The remaining flour needed is part of the total flour requirement (9 cups), just as the remaining sugar needed is part of the total sugar requirement (6 cups). \n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that computes the difference between the required cups of flour and sugar based on the ingredients in the recipe and Mary's initial action. Here's the plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `cake_baking_difference` that takes into account the total cups of sugar and flour required (`TotalSugar` and `TotalFlour`) and the cups of flour already added (`AddedFlour`).\n2. **Calculate Remaining Ingredients**: Determine the remaining flour and sugar needed by subtracting the already added flour from the total flour requirement, and similarly for sugar.\n3. **Calculate the Difference**: Find the difference between the remaining flour and sugar quantities. If the flour requirement is higher, the difference will be positive; if sugar is higher, it will be negative.\n4. **Query with Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find and present this difference.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in required cups of flour and sugar\ncake_baking_difference(TotalSugar, TotalFlour, AddedFlour, Difference) :-\n    RemainingFlour is TotalFlour - AddedFlour,\n    RemainingSugar is TotalSugar,\n    Difference is RemainingFlour - RemainingSugar.\n\n% Example query to find out the difference in cups required for flour and sugar\n% Given total sugar as 6 cups, total flour as 9 cups, and already added flour as 2 cups\n?- cake_baking_difference(6, 9, 2, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the baking scenario and computes the required difference in cups between flour and sugar.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDanny's bottle cap and wrapper collection is expanding. After his visit to the park, we need to determine the initial number of bottle caps he had in his collection. He started with some bottle caps and wrappers, and after adding the finds from the park, his collection grew. We will calculate the difference between his final and initial bottle cap counts to find the initial count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved using basic arithmetic:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: There's an unknown number of bottle caps and wrappers that Danny had before his park visit.\n2. **Park Find**: He found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park.\n3. **Final Count**: After adding the park finds, Danny has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers.\n4. **Calculation**: To find the initial number of bottle caps, we'll subtract the final bottle cap count from the count after the park visit.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to write a rule that computes the initial number of bottle caps based on the final counts and the additions made after the park visit. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `find_initial_caps` that takes four variables: `FinalCaps`, `ParkCaps`, `InitialCaps`, and `Wrappers`.\n2. The difference between `FinalCaps` and `ParkCaps` gives the number of bottle caps Danny had initially: `InitialCaps - FinalCaps`.\n3.

Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a rule `eaten_candy`**: This rule will have three variables - `InitialCandy`, `LeftCandy`, and `EatenCandy`.\n2. **Arithmetic relationship**: Use the `is` keyword in Prolog to express the relationship between these variables. `EatenCandy` is the difference between `InitialCandy` and `LeftCandy`.\n3. **Querying the rule**: We will write a query in Prolog to find out how many pieces of candy Bobby ate, given the initial and final candy counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of candies eaten\neaten_candy(InitialCandy, LeftCandy, EatenCandy) :-\n    EatenCandy is InitialCandy - LeftCandy.\n\n% Example query to find the number of candies Bobby ate\n% Based on initial and final candy counts\n?- eaten_candy(32, 20, EatenCandy).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the initial and final states of candy and computes the number of candies eaten.

To find the number of chapters Frank read daily, we'll first calculate the number of pages per chapter and then divide the total number of pages read per day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into arithmetic operations:\n\n1. Identify the total number of chapters in the book: 15 chapters.\n2. Calculate the number of pages per chapter: \\( \\frac{193\\,\\text{pages}}{15\\,\\text{chapters}} \\).\n3. Given that Frank finished the book in 660 days, we need to calculate the number of chapters he read per day by dividing the total number of chapters by the number of days.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the number of chapters Frank read daily.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the difference in the number of eggs Rebecca has compared to marbles. She has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. To find this difference, we can calculate the number of eggs in each group and then compare the number of eggs to the number of marbles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached as follows:\n\n1.

To solve this, we'll first find out how many apples Adam has, then add the specified number of apples to arrive at Bob's apple count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into clearer steps:\n\n1. Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. This implies that Adam has 4 apples more than half of the total number of apples Jackie and Adam have together (because together they have 14 apples).\n2. We can find the number of apples Adam has by taking half of 14 and adding 4 to it.\n3. Once we know Adam's apple count, we can add 6 apples to that number, which should give us Bob's total apple count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the number of apples Adam has, and then adds the right number of apples to reach Bob's count. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `apples_count` with four variables: `JackieApples`, `AdamHasMoreThanJackie`, `AdamApples`, and `BobApples`.\n2. Calculate Adam's apples by taking half of Jackie's apples and adding the difference Adam has more than Jackie (4 apples).\n3.

Initially, there are 85 bird families in the vicinity of the mountain. Some of them fly away to Africa, and others to Asia. To find out the number of bird families left near the mountain, we'll subtract the total number of families that migrated from the initial count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into simple steps:\n\n1.

To find the width, we can compute the square root of the carpet's area, as the length is already known. The width will be equal to the square root of the carpet's area.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the known length of Jesse's room: 7 feet.\n2. Calculate the square root of the required carpet area: The width of the room will be equal to the square root of 14.\n3.

The grasshopper's jump length is known: 36 inches.\n2. The frog jumps 17 inches farther than the grasshopper. We can represent the frog's jump as 36 inches + 17 inches = 53 inches.\n3. The mouse jumps 15 inches farther than the frog, so we can express the mouse's jump as 53 inches + 15 inches = 68 inches.\n\nNow, we know the difference in jump lengths between the frog and the mouse, which is 15 inches.

Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find the total number of white t-shirts using the rule, given the number of packages and shirts per package.\n\nAdditionally, we'll also provide the number of trousers purchased as an input, even though it might not directly affect the count of white t-shirts. This aligns with the complete information provided in the problem statement.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of white t-shirts\ncount_tshirts(Packages, ShirtsPerPackage, TotalShirts, Trousers) :-\n    TotalShirts is Packages * ShirtsPerPackage.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of white t-shirts\n% With 57 packages, 53 shirts per package, and 34 trousers\n?- count_tshirts(57, 53, TotalShirts, 34).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the relationship between the number of packages, shirts per package, and the total number of shirts.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Start by defining a rule named `not_hiding_alligators` with four variables: `InitialSnakes`, `InitialAlligators`, `HidingSnakes`, and `HidingAlligators`, representing the respective quantities.\n2. **Calculate the Number of Alligators Not Hiding**: Subtract `HidingAlligators` from `InitialAlligators` to find the number of alligators that were not hiding.\n3. **Use Prolog's Querying**: Use Prolog's querying mechanism to solve for the number of alligators not hiding by providing the initial counts and the number of hidden creatures.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to find alligators not hiding\nnot_hiding_alligators(InitialSnakes, InitialAlligators, HidingSnakes, HidingAlligators, NotHidingAlligators) :-\n    NotHidingAlligators is InitialAlligators - HidingAlligators.\n\n% Example query to determine the alligators that were not hiding\n% With the given initial counts and hidden creatures\n?- not_hiding_alligators(3, 75, 82, 19, NotHidingAlligators).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code establishes the relationship between the initial counts and the final number of alligators not hiding. Running the query will return the correct answer.",

To find the total number of flowers, we need to calculate how many seeds were successful in growing.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Identify the total number of seeds planted: 55 seeds.\n2. Identify the number of seeds planted per flower bed: 15 seeds.\n3. Find the number of successful seeds per flower bed: 60 seeds grew successfully.\n4. Calculate the total number of successful seeds by dividing the total number of seeds by the seeds planted per bed and then multiplying by the successful seeds per bed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to set up a rule-based system that computes the total number of flowers.

The recipe calls for a total of 7 cups of sugar, but she has already added 4 cups. The task is to calculate the difference between the desired sugar amount and the amount already added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved using basic arithmetic:\n\n1. We know the total amount of sugar required according to the recipe is 7 cups.\n2. We have information about the sugar already added, which is 4 cups.\n3. To find the remaining amount of sugar needed, we subtract the added sugar from the desired sugar.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that computes the remaining amount of sugar needed.

The grasshopper's jump is described as 2 inches more than the frog's jump. We can represent the frog's jump as 13 inches minus this 2-inch difference.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we'll set up a straightforward rule that subtracts the described difference from the grasshopper's jump distance to find the frog's jump distance.
