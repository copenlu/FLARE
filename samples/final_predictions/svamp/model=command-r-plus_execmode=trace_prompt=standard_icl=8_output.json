To find out how much money she has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the bagels and then subtract this amount from her initial money.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount of money Olivia has: $23.\n2. Identify the number of bagels purchased: 5 bagels.\n3. Identify the cost of each bagel: $3 per bagel.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the bagels: \\( 5 \\times 3 \\).\n5. Subtract the total cost of the bagels from Olivia's initial amount of money to find out how much money she has left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that captures the relationship between the initial amount of money, the number of bagels purchased, the cost per bagel, and the remaining amount of money. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_remaining_money` that takes four variables: `InitialMoney`, `BagelsPurchased`, `CostPerBagel`, and `RemainingMoney`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total cost of the bagels is the product of `BagelsPurchased` and `CostPerBagel`.\n3. The remaining amount of money is the difference between the initial amount of money and the total cost of the bagels.\n4.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `plant_trees`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialTrees`, `FinalTrees`, and `PlantedTrees`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the difference between `FinalTrees` and `InitialTrees`, which gives `PlantedTrees`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of trees planted given the initial and final counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of trees planted\nplant_trees(InitialTrees, FinalTrees, PlantedTrees) :-\n    PlantedTrees is FinalTrees - InitialTrees.\n\n% Example query to find out how many trees were planted today\n% Given initial trees as 15 and final trees as 21\n?- plant_trees(15, 21, PlantedTrees).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the initial and final tree counts and computes the number of trees planted.

        "question": "After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day, how many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over a period of 25 days, given the visitor count for two individual days. On one day, there were 246 visitors, and on the previous day, there were 703 visitors. To find the total number of visitors over 25 days, we need to consider the average daily visitor count and then multiply it by the number of days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the visitor count for day 1: 246 visitors.\n2. Identify the visitor count for day 2: 703 visitors.\n3. Calculate the average daily visitor count: Sum up the visitor counts for the two days and then divide by 2.\n4. Multiply the average daily visitor count by the number of days (25) to find the total number of visitors over the 25-day period.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total number of visitors based on the average daily visitor count and the number of days. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `total_visitors`**: Create a rule with parameters `Day1Visitors`, `Day2Visitors`, `AvgDailyVisitors`, `NumberOfDays`, and `TotalVisitors`.\n2. **Calculate Average Daily Visitors**: Inside the rule, compute the average daily visitor count by taking the sum of `Day1Visitors` and `Day2Visitors` and dividing it by 2.\n3. **Compute Total Visitors**: Multiply the `AvgDailyVisitors` by `NumberOfDays` to find the `TotalVisitors`.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query to find the `TotalVisitors` given the visitor counts for the two days and the number of days.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of visitors over 25 days\ntotal_visitors(Day1Visitors, Day2Visitors, AvgDailyVisitors, NumberOfDays, TotalVisitors) :-\n    AvgDailyVisitors is (Day1Visitors + Day2Visitors) / 2,\n    TotalVisitors is AvgDailyVisitors * NumberOfDays.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of visitors over 25 days\n% Given day 1 visitors as 246, day 2 visitors as 703, and number of days as 25\n?- total_visitors(246, 703, AvgDailyVisitors, 25, TotalVisitors).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the total number of visitors based on the average daily visitor count and the number of days.

Calculate the difference between the number of visitors on the second day and the first day to find out how many more visitors there were on the second day.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining a rule that calculates the difference in the number of visitors between two days. Here's a structured plan for the code:\n\n1. Define a rule `compare_visitors` that takes three arguments: `VisitorsDay1`, `VisitorsDay2`, and `Difference`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `Difference` is calculated by subtracting `VisitorsDay1` from `VisitorsDay2`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find out the value of `Difference` given the number of visitors on each day.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to compare the number of visitors on two days\ncompare_visitors(VisitorsDay1, VisitorsDay2, Difference) :-\n    Difference is VisitorsDay2 - VisitorsDay1.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more visitors came on the second day\n% Given visitors on day 1 as 600 and visitors on day 2 as 661\n?- compare_visitors(600, 661, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a straightforward relationship between the visitor counts on two consecutive days and computes the difference, indicating how many more visitors there were on the second day.

Subtract the number of additional bags from the total to find out how many bags she had on Monday.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining a rule that calculates the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday based on the total number of bags and the number of additional bags she found. Here's a structured plan for the code:\n\n1. Define a rule `bags_on_monday` that takes three parameters: `TotalBags`, `AdditionalBags`, and `MondayBags`.\n2. Calculate the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday by subtracting the `AdditionalBags` from the `TotalBags`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities to find out the value of `MondayBags` given the total number of bags and the additional bags found.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday\nbags_on_monday(TotalBags, AdditionalBags, MondayBags) :-\n    MondayBags is TotalBags - AdditionalBags.\n\n% Example query to find out how many bags Tiffany had on Monday\n% Given a total of 8 bags and finding 4 more bags on Tuesday\n?- bags_on_monday(8, 4, MondayBags).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the total number of bags and the number of additional bags to determine the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday.

Danny initially had a collection of 42 bottle caps. He found 30 bottle caps at the park and threw away some old ones, resulting in a final count of 42 bottle caps. To find out how many more he threw away than he found, we need to compare these two quantities.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of bottle caps in Danny's collection: 42 bottle caps.\n2. Identify the number of bottle caps Danny found at the park: 30 bottle caps.\n3. Calculate the number of bottle caps Danny threw away: The difference between the initial count (42) and the final count (which is also 42) will give us the number of bottle caps he threw away.\n4.

Set `Comparison` to negative (`-`) if the number of bottle caps thrown away is less than the number found, positive (`+`) if greater, and zero (`=`) if they are equal.\n4.

She has already added 10 cups of sugar, and the recipe calls for a total of 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. To determine how many more cups of flour she needs to add compared to sugar, we need to calculate the difference between the required amounts of flour and sugar left to be added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Sugar**: Mary has already added 10 cups, and the recipe calls for a total of 12 cups of sugar. So, she needs to add \\( 12 - 10 \\) more cups of sugar.\n2. **Flour**: The recipe requires a total of 14 cups of flour.

The cake recipe calls for specific quantities of sugar and flour: 6 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. So far, she has already used 7 cups of flour and an excessive amount of sugar (60 cups). To complete the recipe, she wants to know how many more cups of flour she needs to add.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Initial Flour**: Mary has already used 7 cups of flour.\n2. **Required Flour**: The recipe calls for a total of 14 cups of flour.\n3. **Calculation**: To find out how much more flour she needs, subtract the amount of flour she has already used (7 cups) from the total required amount (14 cups).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the additional amount of flour Mary needs to add based on the initial amount she has used and the required total. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `flour_needed`**: This rule will take three parameters - `FlourUsed`, `TotalFlourRequired`, and `FlourNeeded`.\n2. **Arithmetic Operation**: Calculate `FlourNeeded` by subtracting `FlourUsed` from `TotalFlourRequired`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, given the amount of flour she has already used and the total required amount.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the additional flour needed\nflour_needed(FlourUsed, TotalFlourRequired, FlourNeeded) :-\n    FlourNeeded is TotalFlourRequired - FlourUsed.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add\n% Given flour used as 7 cups and total flour required as 14 cups\n?- flour_needed(7, 14, FlourNeeded).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial flour used, the total required flour, and the additional flour needed.

After the weekend, Fred now has $115, and Jason has $44. To find out how much they earned from washing cars and delivering newspapers, we need to calculate the difference in their amounts before and after the weekend.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into simple arithmetic steps:\n\n1. Identify Fred's initial amount: $111.\n2. Identify Fred's amount after the weekend: $115.\n3. Calculate Fred's earnings: Subtract his initial amount from his amount after the weekend.\n4. Identify Jason's initial amount: $40.\n5. Identify Jason's amount after the weekend: $44.\n6. Calculate Jason's earnings: Subtract his initial amount from his amount after the weekend.\n7. The total earnings from both activities is the sum of Fred's and Jason's individual earnings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to define rules for calculating individual earnings and then sum them up to find the total earnings. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `individual_earnings` that takes initial and final amounts for Fred and Jason, and calculates their individual earnings.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to calculate individual earnings by subtracting initial amounts from final amounts.\n3. Define another rule `total_earnings` that uses the `individual_earnings` rule to calculate and sum up Fred's and Jason's earnings.\n4.

We need to subtract 16 from the frog's jump.\n4. **Comparison**: Finally, we compare the mouse's jump with the grasshopper's jump to find out how much farther the mouse jumped.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that establishes the relationships between the jumps of the grasshopper, frog, and mouse. Here's a structured plan:\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `jump_comparison` that takes the jumps of the grasshopper, frog, and mouse as arguments.\n2. **Calculate Frog's Jump**: Within the rule, calculate the frog's jump by adding 37 inches to the grasshopper's jump.\n3. **Calculate Mouse's Jump**: Calculate the mouse's jump by subtracting 16 inches from the frog's jump.\n4. **Compare Jumps**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to find the difference between the mouse's jump and the grasshopper's jump, representing how much farther the mouse jumped.\n5. **Query**: Write a query using the `jump_comparison` rule to find the answer given the jumps of the grasshopper and frog, and the relationship with the mouse's jump.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to compare the jumps of the grasshopper, frog, and mouse\njump_comparison(GrasshopperJump, FrogJump, MouseJump) :-\n    FrogJump is GrasshopperJump + 37,\n    MouseJump is FrogJump - 16.\n\n% Example query to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper\n% Given grasshopper's jump as 14 and the relationship with frog's and mouse's jumps\n?- jump_comparison(14, FrogJump, MouseJump).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships between the jumps and allows us to query the system to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper.",

Steven serves as a reference point, as he has 8 more peaches than Jill and 3 more peaches than Jake. Given that Steven has 5 peaches, we can set up equations to find out how many peaches Jake and Jill have and then compare their counts.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information:\n\n1. Let's represent the number of peaches Jill has as 'J'.\n2. Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so he has 'J + 8' peaches.\n3. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has '(J + 8) - 3' peaches.\n4. Given that Steven has 5 peaches, we can substitute: '5 = J + 8'.\n5. Solving for 'J', we get: 'J = 5 - 8', which simplifies to 'J = -3'.\n6.

Then, 5 customers left. To find out how many customers the waiter still has, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the initial count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using a simple arithmetic operation:\n\n1.

We need to calculate the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards to determine how many more Ace cards she has.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following arithmetic calculations:\n\n1.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule `compare_cups`**: This rule will take five parameters - `SugarCups`, `FlourCups`, `SaltCups`, `FlourUsed`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Flour**: Inside the rule, calculate the remaining flour needed by subtracting `FlourUsed` from `FlourCups`.\n3. **Compute Difference**: Compare the remaining flour needed with the salt needed. If the remaining flour is more than the salt, the difference is positive. If it's less, the difference is negative.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find out the difference in cups between the remaining flour and the salt needed, given the initial ingredient quantities and the amount of flour already used.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to compare the number of cups of flour and salt needed\ncompare_cups(SugarCups, FlourCups, SaltCups, FlourUsed, Difference) :-\n    RemainingFlour is FlourCups - FlourUsed,\n    (RemainingFlour > SaltCups -> Difference > 0;\n     RemainingFlour < SaltCups -> Difference < 0;\n     Difference =:= 0).\n\n% Example query to find out the difference in cups between flour and salt needed\n% Given sugar cups as 9, flour cups as 7, salt cups as 4, and flour already used as 2\n?- compare_cups(9, 7, 4, 2, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the ingredient quantities and computes the difference in cups between the remaining flour and the salt needed.

Identify the number of bird families that flew away to Africa: 47.\n2. Identify the number of bird families that flew away to Asia: 94.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Asia and the number that flew away to Africa to find out how many more flew to Asia.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a rule that calculates the difference in the number of bird families migrating to Asia and Africa. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `compare_migration` that takes four variables: `TotalBirds`, `AfricaBirds`, `AsiaBirds`, and `Difference`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `Difference` is the result of subtracting `AfricaBirds` from `AsiaBirds`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `Difference` given the total number of bird families and the numbers that flew away to Africa and Asia.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference in bird families migrating to Asia and Africa\ncompare_migration(TotalBirds, AfricaBirds, AsiaBirds, Difference) :-\n    Difference is AsiaBirds - AfricaBirds.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more bird families flew to Asia than Africa\n% Given total bird families as 38, Africa as 47, and Asia as 94\n?- compare_migration(38, 47, 94, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the difference in the number of bird families migrating to Asia and Africa.

Identify the number of push-ups Zachary did: 19 push-ups.\n2. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so we add 39 to Zachary's count: \\( 19 + 39 \\).\n3. John did 13 push-ups less than David, which means David did 13 more push-ups than John.\n4.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, and it is given that the grasshopper's jump was 4 inches farther than the frog's jump. Additionally, the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. To find the distance of the frog's jump, we need to consider the relationships between these jumps and set up equations to solve for the unknown jump distance of the frog.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Grasshopper's Jump**: The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.\n2. **Relationship with Frog's Jump**: The grasshopper's jump was 4 inches more than the frog's jump, so the frog's jump is 4 inches less than the grasshopper's jump.\n3. **Relationship with Mouse's Jump**: The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. This means the frog's jump is 44 inches more than the mouse's jump.\n4. **Set Up Equations**:\n   - Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 4 inches\n   - Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 44 inches\n5. **Solve for Frog's Jump**:\n   - We don't know the exact jump distances for the frog and the mouse, so we'll use variables:\n     - Let the frog's jump be represented by the variable `F`.\n     - Let the mouse's jump be represented by the variable `M`.\n6. **Solve the Equations**:\n   - Grasshopper's jump - 4 inches = `F`\n   - `F` - 44 inches = M\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will set up the relationships between the jumps as facts and then query the system to find the value of the frog's jump.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of seats in each school bus for a field trip. The school has certain constraints, such as the number of classrooms, students, and buses. With the given information, we need to calculate the number of seats each bus must have to accommodate all the students.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the number of students and the number of buses available. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Number of Students**: There are 98 students in the school.\n2. **Number of Buses**: The school has 7 buses available.\n3. **Calculation**: To find the number of seats in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses. This will give us the average number of seats required per bus to accommodate all the students.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of seats per bus based on the given information. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `seats_per_bus` that accepts three parameters: `TotalStudents`, `NumberOfBuses`, and `SeatsPerBus`.\n2. **Calculate Seats Per Bus**: Inside the rule, calculate the number of seats per bus by dividing the `TotalStudents` by the `NumberOfBuses`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the number of seats per bus given the total number of students and the number of buses.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of seats per bus\nseats_per_bus(TotalStudents, NumberOfBuses, SeatsPerBus) :-\n    SeatsPerBus is ceil(TotalStudents / NumberOfBuses).\n\n% Example query to find out the number of seats per bus for the field trip\n% Given total students as 98 and number of buses as 7\n?- seats_per_bus(98, 7, SeatsPerBus).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the total number of students and the number of buses to compute the required number of seats per bus.

Calculate the number of kids who went to camp by subtracting the number of kids who stayed home from the total population: \\( 91,676 - 61,619 \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of kids who went to camp based on the given information. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `kids_at_camp` that takes three parameters: `TotalKids`, `KidsStayedHome`, and `KidsAtCamp`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: `KidsAtCamp` is the difference between `TotalKids` and `KidsStayedHome`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for `KidsAtCamp` given the total number of kids in Lawrence County and the number of kids who stayed home.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of kids who went to camp\nkids_at_camp(TotalKids, KidsStayedHome, KidsAtCamp) :-\n    KidsAtCamp is TotalKids - KidsStayedHome.\n\n% Example query to find out how many kids from Lawrence County went to camp\n% Given total kids in Lawrence County as 91676 and kids stayed home as 61619\n?- kids_at_camp(91676, 61619, KidsAtCamp).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship and computes the number of kids who went to camp based on the given data.

To find the size of each banana group, we need to perform a division operation.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be analyzed and solved using the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of bananas**: Philip has a total of 203 bananas.\n2. **Determine the number of groups**: He wants to organize the bananas into 7 groups.\n3. **Calculate the size of each group**: To find the size of each banana group, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups. This can be done using the division operator in SWI-Prolog.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the size of each banana group based on the total number of bananas and the desired number of groups. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define a rule `banana_group_size`**: This rule will take three arguments - `TotalBananas`, `NumberOfGroups`, and `GroupSize`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the size of each banana group. Divide the `TotalBananas` by `NumberOfGroups` to find the `GroupSize`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: Write a query that uses this rule to find the size of each banana group given the total number of bananas and the desired number of groups.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the size of each banana group\nbanana_group_size(TotalBananas, NumberOfGroups, GroupSize) :-\n    GroupSize is TotalBananas // NumberOfGroups.\n\n% Example query to find out the size of each banana group\n% Given total bananas as 203 and number of groups as 7\n?- banana_group_size(203, 7, GroupSize).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a straightforward relationship between the total number of bananas and the desired number of groups, and it computes the size of each banana group.

Calculate the total number of old games they have together: \\( 80 + 41 \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a simple rule that calculates the total number of old games based on the counts for Katie and her friends. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_old_games` that takes two variables: `KatiesOldGames` and `FriendsOldGames`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: the total number of old games is the sum of `KatiesOldGames` and `FriendsOldGames`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to solve for the total number of old games they have together.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of old games\ntotal_old_games(KatiesOldGames, FriendsOldGames, TotalOldGames) :-\n    TotalOldGames is KatiesOldGames + FriendsOldGames.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of old games they have\n% Given Katie's old games as 80 and her friends' old games as 41\n?- total_old_games(80, 41, TotalOldGames).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a straightforward relationship between the old game counts for Katie and her friends, and it computes their combined total of old games.

Initially, there are 6 birds and 3 storks on the fence.\n2. 2 more storks arrive, increasing the number of storks.\n3. To determine how many more birds there are than storks, we need to compare the final counts of birds and storks.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the difference between the number of birds and storks on the fence. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `birds_more_than_storks` that takes four parameters - `InitialBirds`, `InitialStorks`, `StorksArrived`, and `Difference`.\n2. **Calculate Final Counts**: Inside the rule, calculate the final number of storks by adding `StorksArrived` to `InitialStorks`.\n3. **Compute Difference**: Calculate the difference between the final number of birds and the final number of storks to find out how many more birds there are.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the value of `Difference` by providing the initial counts of birds and storks, as well as the number of additional storks that arrived.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the difference between the number of birds and storks\nbirds_more_than_storks(InitialBirds, InitialStorks, StorksArrived, Difference) :-\n    FinalStorks is InitialStorks + StorksArrived,\n    Difference is InitialBirds - FinalStorks.\n\n% Example query to find out how many more birds are on the fence than storks\n% Given initial birds as 6, initial storks as 3, and additional storks as 2\n?- birds_more_than_storks(6, 3, 2, Difference).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the initial counts of birds and storks, the number of additional storks, and computes the difference, representing how many more birds are on the fence than storks.

We are given that Jesse's room is 7 feet long, and she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet. To find the width of the room, we need to calculate it based on the provided information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved using the concept of area. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Known Values**: We know the length of the room (7 feet) and the required carpet size (14 square feet).\n2. **Understand the Relationship**: The area of the carpet should be equal to the area of the room.\n3. **Calculate the Width**: We can find the width of the room by dividing the required carpet size by the length of the room.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the width of the room based on the length and the required carpet size. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `room_width` that accepts three parameters: `Length`, `CarpetSize`, and `Width`.\n2. **Calculate Width**: Inside the rule, calculate the width of the room by dividing the `CarpetSize` by the `Length`.\n3. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the width of Jesse's room by providing the length of the room and the required carpet size.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the width of the room\nroom_width(Length, CarpetSize, Width) :-\n    Width is CarpetSize / Length.\n\n% Example query to find out the width of Jesse's room\n% Given length of the room as 7 feet and required carpet size as 14 square feet\n?- room_width(7, 14, Width).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the length of the room, the required carpet size, and the width.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define Rules**: Create rules `steven_peaches`, `jake_peaches`, and `jill_peaches` to represent the relationships between their peach counts.\n2. **Relationships**: Express the relationships using Prolog arithmetic:\n   - `jake_peaches(JakePeaches, StevenPeaches) :- JakePeaches is StevenPeaches - 12.`\n   - `steven_jill_peaches(StevenPeaches, JillPeaches) :- StevenPeaches is JillPeaches + 8.`\n3. **Query**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to solve for Jill's peaches given the relationships:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- steven_peaches(StevenPeaches, 18),\n      jake_peaches(JakePeaches, StevenPeaches),\n      steven_jill_peaches(StevenPeaches, JillPeaches).\n   ```\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Rule for Jake's peaches\njake_peaches(JakePeaches, StevenPeaches) :-\n    JakePeaches is StevenPeaches - 12.\n\n% Rule for Steven's and Jill's peaches\nsteven_jill_peaches(StevenPeaches, JillPeaches) :-\n    StevenPeaches is JillPeaches + 8.\n\n% Example query to find out how many peaches Jill has\n% Given that Steven has 18 peaches\n?- steven_peaches(StevenPeaches, 18),\n   jake_peaches(JakePeaches, StevenPeaches),\n   steven_jill_peaches(StevenPeaches, JillPeaches).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships between the peach counts of Steven, Jake, and Jill. The query at the end will execute in a Prolog environment to provide the answer for the number of peaches Jill has.",

The cake recipe instructs her to use 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar in total. However, she has already added 4 cups of sugar to the mixture. Now, she wants to know how the remaining quantity of flour she needs to add compares to the remaining quantity of sugar. In other words, she wants to find out how many cups of flour she needs to add for every cup of sugar.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. **Remaining Sugar**: First, we need to determine how much sugar is still needed by subtracting the amount Mary has already added (4 cups) from the total amount of sugar required (6 cups).\n2. **Remaining Flour**: Next, we calculate the amount of flour Mary has yet to add by subtracting no cups from the total amount of flour the recipe calls for (9 cups).\n3. **Comparison**: Finally, we compare the remaining quantities of flour and sugar to determine their ratio. Specifically, we want to know how many cups of flour she needs to add for each additional cup of sugar.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define rules and perform calculations to find the relationship between the remaining quantities of flour and sugar.

Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named `unoccupied_chairs` that takes parameters for the number of chair sets, chairs per set, and the number of people sitting.\n2. **Calculate Total Chairs**: Within the rule, calculate the total number of chairs by multiplying the number of chair sets by the number of chairs per set.\n3. **Calculate Occupied Chairs**: Assume that each person occupies one chair, so the number of occupied chairs is equal to the number of people sitting.\n4. **Calculate Unoccupied Chairs**: Find the number of unoccupied chairs by subtracting the number of occupied chairs from the total number of chairs.\n5. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to find the number of unoccupied chairs given the number of chair sets and the number of people sitting.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of unoccupied chairs\nunoccupied_chairs(ChairSets, ChairsPerSet, PeopleSitting, UnoccupiedChairs) :-\n    TotalChairs is ChairSets * ChairsPerSet,\n    OccupiedChairs is PeopleSitting,  % Assuming each person occupies one chair\n    UnoccupiedChairs is TotalChairs - OccupiedChairs.\n\n% Example query to find out how many chairs are left unoccupied\n% Given 10 sets of tables and 6 chairs per set, with 11 people sitting\n?- unoccupied_chairs(10, 6, 11, UnoccupiedChairs).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the given parameters and computes the number of unoccupied chairs.

Identify the initial number of crayons: 531 crayons.\n2. Identify the initial number of erasers: 38 erasers.\n3. Determine the total number of items Paul had at the end of the school year: 391 items.\n4. Calculate the number of crayons left by subtracting the initial number of erasers (since none were lost) from the total remaining items: \\( 391 - 38 \\).\n5. Find the difference between the number of crayons left and the initial number of erasers to determine how many more crayons he had compared to erasers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe use of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem involves defining a rule that calculates the difference between the remaining crayons and the initial number of erasers. Here\u2019s a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1.

Calculate the number of remaining crayons by subtracting the initial number of erasers from the total remaining items.\n3. Compute the difference between the remaining crayons and the initial number of erasers to find out how many more crayons he had.\n4.

Each basket contains 4 red peaches, and we want to find out the number of green peaches in each basket.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. **Known Information**: There are 2 identical baskets, and each basket contains 4 red peaches. There is a total of 12 peaches across all baskets.\n2. **Unknown Information**: We need to find the number of green peaches in each basket.\n3. **Mathematical Relationship**: The number of green peaches in one basket can be found by subtracting the number of red peaches from half the total number of peaches.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of green peaches in each basket based on the given information.

Identify Lewis's regular weekly earnings: $28 per week.\n2. Identify Lewis's overtime weekly earnings: $939 per week.\n3. Determine the number of weeks in the harvest season: 1091 weeks.\n4. Calculate the total earnings from regular work: \\( 28 \\times 1091 \\).\n5. Calculate the total earnings from overtime work: \\( 939 \\times 1091 \\).\n6. Add the total earnings from regular and overtime work to find Lewis's total earnings during the harvest season.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the total earnings based on the given weekly rates and the number of weeks. Here\u2019s a structured plan for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_earnings` that accepts four parameters: `RegularWeeklyEarnings`, `OvertimeWeeklyEarnings`, `NumberOfWeeks`, and `TotalEarnings`.\n2. Express the relationship between these variables using arithmetic operations: Calculate the total earnings from regular work and overtime work separately by multiplying their respective rates by the number of weeks.\n3. Sum up the total earnings from regular and overtime work to obtain `TotalEarnings`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `TotalEarnings` given the regular and overtime weekly rates and the number of weeks.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total earnings during the harvest season\ntotal_earnings(RegularWeeklyEarnings, OvertimeWeeklyEarnings, NumberOfWeeks, TotalEarnings) :-\n    RegularTotal is RegularWeeklyEarnings * NumberOfWeeks,\n    OvertimeTotal is OvertimeWeeklyEarnings * NumberOfWeeks,\n    TotalEarnings is RegularTotal + OvertimeTotal.\n\n% Example query to find out Lewis's total earnings during the harvest season\n% Given regular weekly earnings as $28, overtime weekly earnings as $939, and number of weeks as 1091\n?- total_earnings(28, 939, 1091, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationship between the earnings rates, the number of weeks, and the total earnings.

To determine the frog's jumping distance, we need to calculate the sum of the grasshopper's jump and the additional 2 inches.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. **Grasshopper's Jump**: The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.\n2. **Frog's Jump**: The frog jumped 2 inches more than the grasshopper.\n3. **Calculation**: To find the frog's jumping distance, we add 2 inches to the grasshopper's jump: \\( 13 + 2 \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the frog's jumping distance based on the given information. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `frog_jump`**: This rule will take two arguments - `GrasshopperJump` and `FrogJump`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: We will use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the frog's jump as `GrasshopperJump` plus 2 inches.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find the frog's jumping distance given the grasshopper's jump.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the frog's jumping distance\nfrog_jump(GrasshopperJump, FrogJump) :-\n    FrogJump is GrasshopperJump + 2.\n\n% Example query to find out how far the frog jumped\n% Given grasshopper's jump as 13 inches\n?- frog_jump(13, FrogJump).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the grasshopper's jump and the frog's jump, taking into account the additional 2 inches. The query provided will execute in a Prolog environment to yield the frog's jumping distance.",
