        "question": "Can a false pope become a saint?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\nThe process of becoming a saint within the Catholic Church is known as canonization. Typically, this process involves an extensive investigation into the candidate's life, virtues, and contributions to the Church. The notion of a \"false pope,\" however, introduces complexities and ambiguities that must be addressed.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe question requires clarification on two fronts: the criteria for sainthood and the concept of a \"false pope.\" Clarifying these terms and their implications is essential to determine if such a scenario is logically possible.\n\n### Plan for Logically Answering the Question:\n\n#### Define \"False Pope\":\n- Start by explaining the term \"false pope\" and the circumstances that might lead to such a perception. Clarify historical context or controversial situations that could give rise to the label of a \"false pope.\"\n\n#### Investigate Sainthood Criteria:\n- Outline the criteria and process the Catholic Church uses for canonization, including the requirements for sainthood.\n- Highlight any provisions or exceptions within canon law that might relate to exceptional cases, including those regarding popes.\n\n#### Examine Historical Precedents:\n- Research past instances of controversial or disputed papal figures and their legacies.\n- Analyze how the Catholic Church has historically dealt with contentious papal succession or imposters.\n\n#### Consult Theological Expertise:\n- Seek insights from theological scholars and experts on canon law regarding the theoretical possibility of a \"false pope\" being considered for sainthood.\n\n#### Evaluate the Canonization Process:\n- Discuss the role of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which oversees the canonization process, and how it might perceive and act in a hypothetical scenario involving a \"false pope.\"\n\n#### Weigh Moral and Theological Considerations:\n- Explore the moral and theological dilemmas that could arise from elevating a \"false pope\" to sainthood.\n- Analyze the potential impact on Catholic doctrine and the faithful's perception of papal authority.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n- Summarize the key findings regarding the criteria for sainthood and the complexities introduced by a \"false pope.\"\n- Conclude with a reasoned judgment on the logical possibility of such an occurrence, considering both historical precedent and theological implications.\n\nThis plan delves into the criteria for sainthood, the historical context of papal controversies, and theological insights to provide a reasoned answer on the logical feasibility of a \"false pope\" becoming a saint.",
