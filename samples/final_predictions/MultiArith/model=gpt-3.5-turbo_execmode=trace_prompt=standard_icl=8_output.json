                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nHarry is customizing a workout bar by adding weights of different colors, each with a specified weight. The blue weights each weigh 2 pounds, and the green weights each weigh 3 pounds. He uses 4 blue weights and 5 green weights. Additionally, the bar itself has a weight of 2 pounds. To find the total weight of the bar with the weights, we need to calculate the weight contributed by each color of weight and add it to the bar's weight.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by calculating the total weight for each type of weight and then adding these weights together along with the bar's weight:\n1. Calculate the total weight of the blue weights: Number of blue weights multiplied by the weight of each blue weight.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the green weights: Number of green weights multiplied by the weight of each green weight.\n3. Add the weights of the blue and green weights to the weight of the bar to get the total weight.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total weight based on the given input of the number of each type of weight and the weight of the bar. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_weight` that takes five parameters: the number of blue weights (`NumBlue`), the number of green weights (`NumGreen`), the weight of each blue weight (`WeightBlue`), the weight of each green weight (`WeightGreen`), and the weight of the bar (`WeightBar`).\n2. Calculate the total weight contributed by the blue weights as `NumBlue * WeightBlue`.\n3. Calculate the total weight contributed by the green weights as `NumGreen * WeightGreen`.\n4. Sum the weights from the blue weights, green weights, and the bar to get the `TotalWeight`.\n5. Use swi-prolog's ability to perform arithmetic operations and unify the result with `TotalWeight`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total weight\ntotal_weight(NumBlue, NumGreen, WeightBlue, WeightGreen, WeightBar, TotalWeight) :-\n    TotalBlueWeight is NumBlue * WeightBlue,\n    TotalGreenWeight is NumGreen * WeightGreen,\n    TotalWeight is TotalBlueWeight + TotalGreenWeight + WeightBar.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total weight\n% ?- total_weight(4, 5, 2, 3, 2, TotalWeight).\n% This should output the total weight with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total weight of Harry's custom weight bar setup using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing the power of Prolog in handling mathematical tasks through logical rules."

The goal is to find out the difference in total costs between the two options after considering all these factors.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the first apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($800) and monthly utilities ($260).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost as the product of daily miles driven (31 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the first apartment.\n\n2. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the second apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($900) and monthly utilities ($200).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost using the daily miles driven (21 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the second apartment.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between the two total costs** to determine which apartment allows for greater monthly savings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate each part of the problem and then compare the results.\n\n1. **Define a predicate for calculating transportation cost**:\n   - Parameters: Miles per day, Cost per mile, Days per month.\n   - Returns: Total transportation cost.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for calculating total monthly cost**:\n   - Parameters: Rent, Utilities, Transportation cost.\n   - Returns: Total monthly cost.\n\n3. **Define a predicate to calculate the difference between the two total monthly costs**:\n   - Parameters: Total cost for the first apartment, Total cost for the second apartment.\n   - Returns: Difference in total costs.\n\n4. **Implement the predicates with actual values**:\n   - Use 800 for rent and 260 for utilities for the first apartment.\n   - Use 900 for rent and 200 for utilities for the second apartment.\n   - Use 31 miles and 21 miles for the daily transportation distances for the first and second apartments respectively.\n   - Use 58 cents as the cost per mile and 20 as the number of workdays per month.\n\n5. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference** to compute the results based on the given data.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code this way, we can efficiently compute the required values and compare the costs of the two apartments.

After accumulating his earnings for four weeks, he makes two sequential purchases: first, he spends half of his total savings on a video game, and then he spends a quarter of the remaining amount on a book. The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on similar items. Thus, to find out how much Rachel should budget, we need to calculate Sara's total expenditure and then double that amount to find Rachel's budget.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate Sara's total expenditure by adding the cost of the shoes and the dress.\n2. Double Sara's expenditure to determine Rachel's budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of Rachel's budget based on the expenses of Sara. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent)` which calculates the total amount spent by Sara. This rule will take the cost of the shoes and the dress as input and output the total spent.\n   \n2. Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget. This rule will take the total spent by Sara as input and output the budget for Rachel by doubling Sara's expenditure.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (ShoesCost as $50 and DressCost as $200) and use them to compute the desired budget for Rachel.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `RachelBudget` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define how much Sara spent\ntotal_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent) :-\n    TotalSpent is ShoesCost + DressCost.\n\n% Define Rachel's budget as twice what Sara spent\nbudget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget) :-\n    RachelBudget is 2 * SaraSpent.\n\n% Sample query to find Rachel's budget\n% ?- total_spent_by_sara(50, 200, SaraSpent), budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total spent by Sara and then calculates Rachel's budget based on Sara's expenditure. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given costs of the shoes and dress, outputting the amount Rachel should budget."

The task is to calculate the total cost of the meal and then determine how much each friend must pay if the bill is split equally among them. The items ordered include a Taco Salad, Dave's Single hamburgers, sets of french fries, and cups of peach lemonade, each with specific costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much each friend pays, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each item:\n   - Taco Salad: $10\n   - Dave's Single hamburgers: 5 orders at $5 each = $25\n   - French fries: 4 sets at $2.50 each = $10\n   - Peach lemonade: 5 cups at $2 each = $10\n\n2. Sum up these costs to get the total bill:\n   - Total bill = $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (Hamburgers) + $10 (Fries) + $10 (Lemonade) = $55\n\n3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend pays:\n   - Each friend pays = Total bill / 5\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_bill\" that takes variables for each item's cost and the number of friends.\n2. Assign constants to the costs of individual items (e.g., cost of Taco Salad, cost of a hamburger).\n3. Compute the total cost for each type of item by multiplying the unit cost with the quantity ordered.\n4. Sum up all these total costs to get the final bill.\n5. Divide the final bill by the number of friends to determine how much each friend pays.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define costs of items\nitem_cost(taco_salad, 10).\nitem_cost(hamburger, 5).\nitem_cost(fries, 2.5).\nitem_cost(lemonade, 2).\n\n% Calculate total cost of an item type\ntotal_item_cost(Item, Quantity, TotalCost) :-\n    item_cost(Item, CostPerItem),\n    TotalCost is CostPerItem * Quantity.\n\n% Calculate the total bill and how much each friend pays\ncalculate_bill(NumFriends, EachPays) :-\n    total_item_cost(taco_salad, 1, TotalTacoSalad),\n    total_item_cost(hamburger, 5, TotalHamburgers),\n    total_item_cost(fries, 4, TotalFries),\n    total_item_cost(lemonade, 5, TotalLemonade),\n    TotalBill is TotalTacoSalad + TotalHamburgers + TotalFries + TotalLemonade,\n    EachPays is TotalBill / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost of each item, calculates the total cost for each type of item based on the quantity, sums these to get the total bill, and finally computes the amount each friend pays by dividing the total bill by the number of friends."

We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought.

                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nJo-Bob's hot air balloon ride involves alternating periods of ascent and descent based on whether he pulls the lift chain or releases it. The balloon ascends at a rate of 50 feet per minute when the lift chain is pulled and descends at 10 feet per minute when the chain is not being pulled. He pulls the chain for two separate intervals of 15 minutes each and releases it for an interval of 10 minutes in between these periods. The task is to calculate the highest elevation reached during this ride.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the initial ascent: Jo-Bob pulls the chain for 15 minutes, causing the balloon to rise at 50 feet per minute.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n2. Calculate the descent after the first ascent: Jo-Bob releases the chain for 10 minutes, causing the balloon to descend at 10 feet per minute.\n   - Total descent = 10 minutes * 10 feet/minute = 100 feet.\n3. Calculate the second ascent: Jo-Bob again pulls the chain for 15 minutes at the same ascent rate.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n4. Calculate the highest elevation reached by adding the net gain after the first descent to the second ascent.\n   - Highest elevation = first ascent - first descent + second ascent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to model the balloon's behavior during ascent and descent and to calculate the highest elevation reached. The steps to construct the code are:\n\n1. Define predicates for ascent and descent that calculate the total change in height based on time and rate:\n   - `ascent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n   - `descent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n2. Define a predicate `balloon_ride` that calculates the highest elevation reached by using the ascent and descent predicates and considering the sequence of actions:\n   - `balloon_ride(HighestElevation) :- ascent(15, 50, Ascent1), descent(10, 10, Descent1), ascent(15, 50, Ascent2), HighestElevation is Ascent1 - Descent1 + Ascent2.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the highest elevation:\n   - `?- balloon_ride(HighestElevation).`\n4. The code will use logical inference to determine the total heights for each ascent and descent phase and combine these to find the highest elevation reached.\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to model and solve the problem based on the given conditions of the balloon's ascent and descent rates and the times Jo-Bob pulls or releases the chain."

He has already received commitments from half the class and is working to persuade additional voters. The task involves calculating the total number of votes Alec has secured and determining how many additional votes he needs to reach his goal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Votes Required**: Alec needs three-quarters of the total class votes.\n   - Total class size = 60\n   - Required votes = 3/4 of 60 = 45 votes\n\n2. **Current Votes Secured**: Half of the class has already agreed to vote for Alec.\n   - Votes from half the class = 1/2 of 60 = 30 votes\n\n3. **Additional Votes from Undecided Students**: Out of the remaining students, only 5 were considering voting for him initially. After further campaigning, a fifth of the remaining students (who were not already considering him) decided to vote for him.\n   - Remaining students after 30 commitments = 60 - 30 = 30 students\n   - Initially undecided but considering = 5\n   - Remaining students not considering Alec initially = 30 - 5 = 25\n   - Additional votes after campaigning = 1/5 of 25 = 5 votes\n\n4. **Total Votes After Campaigning**: Sum of votes from committed and persuaded students.\n   - Total votes after initial and additional campaigning = 30 (initially committed) + 5 (initially undecided) + 5 (converted from non-considering) = 40 votes\n\n5. **Votes Needed to Reach Goal**: Subtract the total votes Alec has from the required votes.\n   - Additional votes needed = 45 (goal) - 40 (current) = 5 votes\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how many more votes Alec needs based on the input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_students/1` to hold the total number of students.\n   - `votes_required/2` to calculate the number of votes needed to win.\n   - `initial_votes/2` to calculate the votes Alec initially secured.\n   - `undecided_votes/2` to calculate the votes from students initially undecided.\n   - `additional_campaign_votes/3` to calculate the additional votes from non-considering students after campaigning.\n   - `total_current_votes/2` to sum up all votes Alec has after campaigning.\n   - `votes_needed/3` to calculate how many more votes Alec needs to reach his goal.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of students and check if the output matches the expected number of additional votes needed (5 votes).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values."

Subtract the tickets spent on the hat from the total number of tickets won to find out how many tickets Tom has left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of tickets Tom has left. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total number of tickets won, subtracts the tickets spent on the hat, and then computes the remaining tickets.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_tickets_won(WhackAMoleTickets, SkeeBallTickets, TotalTicketsWon)` that calculates the total number of tickets won by adding the tickets won from 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'.\n2. Define a predicate `tickets_left(TotalTicketsWon, TicketsSpent, TicketsLeft)` that calculates the number of tickets Tom has left by subtracting the tickets spent on the hat from the total tickets won.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nHere's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of tickets won\ntotal_tickets_won(WhackAMoleTickets, SkeeBallTickets, TotalTicketsWon) :-\n    TotalTicketsWon is WhackAMoleTickets + SkeeBallTickets.\n\n% Define the number of tickets Tom has left\ntickets_left(TotalTicketsWon, TicketsSpent, TicketsLeft) :-\n    TicketsLeft is TotalTicketsWon - TicketsSpent.\n\n% Query to find out how many tickets Tom has left\n% ?- total_tickets_won(32, 25, TotalWon), tickets_left(TotalWon, 7, TicketsLeft).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships between the variables and calculates the number of tickets Tom has left after winning tickets from playing 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball' and spending some on the hat. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given values and outputs the number of tickets Tom has left.",

To find the extra apples, we need to determine the total number of apples ordered and subtract the number of apples needed for the 10 students.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Apples Ordered**: The cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples, making a total of 25 + 17 = 42 apples.\n2. **Apples Needed for 10 Students**: Since only 10 students wanted fruit, the number of apples needed is 10.\n3. **Extra Apples**: To find the extra apples, subtract the number of apples needed by the students from the total apples ordered: 42 - 10 = 32 extra apples.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of extra apples based on the given quantities. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to determine the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_apples_ordered/1` to hold the total number of apples ordered.\n   - `apples_needed_for_students/1` to calculate the number of apples needed for the students.\n   - `extra_apples/2` to calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Define the predicates with the actual values from the problem.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain the predicates to derive the final answer.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the values and check if the output matches the expected number of extra apples (32).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can efficiently solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, there were initially 5 friends playing a video game online, with each player having 8 lives. Subsequently, 2 more players joined the game. The task is to calculate the total number of lives all the players have collectively after the additional players have joined.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of lives all the players have after the new players join, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of lives for the initial 5 players: 5 players * 8 lives/player.\n2. Calculate the total number of lives for the 2 new players: 2 players * 8 lives/player.\n3. Add the total number of lives for the initial players and the new players to find the total number of lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the given information. Here's a structured plan to create the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_lives(InitialPlayers, NewPlayers, Lives)` that takes the number of initial players, the number of new players, and calculates the total number of lives.\n2. Calculate the total lives for the initial players by multiplying the number of initial players by the lives per player.\n3. Calculate the total lives for the new players by multiplying the number of new players by the lives per player.\n4. Sum the total lives for the initial players and the new players to get the total number of lives.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and return the total number of lives.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code might look based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of lives\ntotal_lives(InitialPlayers, NewPlayers, Lives) :-\n    LivesPerPlayer = 8,\n    TotalLivesInitial is InitialPlayers * LivesPerPlayer,\n    TotalLivesNew is NewPlayers * LivesPerPlayer,\n    Lives is TotalLivesInitial + TotalLivesNew.\n```\n\nBy defining the `total_lives` predicate in Prolog, we can efficiently calculate the total number of lives all the players have after the new players join.

Here's how we can structure the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalSongs)` that calculates the total number of songs Isabel bought.\n2. Calculate the total number of songs in the country albums by multiplying `CountryAlbums` by `SongsPerAlbum`.\n3. Calculate the total number of songs in the pop albums by multiplying `PopAlbums` by `SongsPerAlbum`.\n4. Sum the number of songs in the country albums and the number of songs in the pop albums to get the `TotalSongs`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of songs Isabel bought\ntotal_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalSongs) :-\n    TotalCountrySongs is CountryAlbums * SongsPerAlbum,\n    TotalPopSongs is PopAlbums * SongsPerAlbum,\n    TotalSongs is TotalCountrySongs + TotalPopSongs.\n\n% Query to find the total number of songs Isabel bought\n% ?- total_songs(6, 2, 9, TotalSongs).\n% This query will calculate the total number of songs Isabel bought.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total number of songs Isabel bought by multiplying the number of albums by the number of songs per album for each type of album and then summing the results.

Determine the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of bears by the number of bears that can fit on each shelf.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule to calculate the number of shelves required based on the given information. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_shelves` that takes the number of bears in stock, the number of bears from the new shipment, and the capacity of each shelf as input parameters.\n2. Calculate the total number of bears by adding the bears in stock and the bears from the new shipment.\n3. Determine the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of bears by the shelf capacity.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and calculate the number of shelves required.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code can be structured based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of shelves needed\ncalculate_shelves(BearsInStock, BearsFromShipment, BearsPerShelf, ShelvesNeeded) :-\n    TotalBears is BearsInStock + BearsFromShipment,\n    ShelvesNeeded is TotalBears // BearsPerShelf.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule that calculates the number of shelves needed based on the total number of bears and the capacity of each shelf. By querying this rule with the appropriate input values, we can determine the number of shelves required to accommodate all the bears in the toy store.",

Determine how many trips Jerry will need to make based on his carrying capacity.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the number of trips Jerry needs to make to pick up all the trays. Here's a structured plan to generate the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_trips` that takes the number of trays from each table and Jerry's carrying capacity as input and calculates the total trips needed.\n2. Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up by summing the trays from each table.\n3. Determine the number of trips by dividing the total number of trays by Jerry's carrying capacity and rounding up to the nearest whole number.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code can be structured based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of trips\ncalculate_trips(TraysTable1, TraysTable2, CarryingCapacity, TotalTrips) :-\n    TotalTrays is TraysTable1 + TraysTable2,\n    TotalTrips is ceil(TotalTrays / CarryingCapacity).\n```\n\nIn this Prolog code, the `calculate_trips` rule calculates the total number of trips Jerry needs to make based on the trays from each table and his carrying capacity. The `ceil` function is used to round up the result to the nearest whole number, ensuring that Jerry makes enough trips to pick up all the trays. This approach leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to solve the problem efficiently.",

Calculate the total number of pictures uploaded by Olivia: 5 pictures from her phone + 35 pictures from her camera = 40 pictures.\n2. Divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to determine how many pictures should be in each album: 40 pictures / 8 albums = 5 pictures per album.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of pictures in each album based on the total number of pictures and the number of albums. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule \"pictures_per_album\" that takes variables for the total number of pictures and the number of albums.\n2. Calculate the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and determine the result.\n\nBy implementing this Prolog code, we can efficiently calculate the number of pictures that should be placed in each album based on the given constraints.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of pictures in each album\npictures_per_album(TotalPictures, NumAlbums, PicturesPerAlbum) :-\n    PicturesPerAlbum is TotalPictures / NumAlbums.\n\n% Query to find the number of pictures in each album\n% ?- pictures_per_album(40, 8, PicturesPerAlbum).\n% This query will calculate the number of pictures in each album.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule to calculate the number of pictures in each album based on the total number of pictures and the number of albums.

Determine the total number of groups that can be formed by dividing the total number of students by the group size of 9.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of groups that can be formed based on the given number of boys and girls. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_groups` that takes the number of boys and girls as input and calculates the total number of groups that can be formed.\n2. Calculate the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls.\n3. Divide the total number of students by the group size of 9 to determine the number of groups.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and compute the number of groups.\n\nHere's a sample Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of groups\ncalculate_groups(Boys, Girls, Groups) :-\n    TotalStudents is Boys + Girls,\n    Groups is TotalStudents // 9.\n\n% Query to find the number of groups that can be formed\n% ?- calculate_groups(5, 40, Groups).\n% This should output the number of groups that can be formed.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem efficiently. By querying the `calculate_groups` predicate with the given number of boys and girls, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of groups that can be formed based on the group size of 9.",

The task is to calculate how many pieces of chocolate candy Dave still has after giving some to his brother.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of chocolate candy pieces Dave still has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chocolate candy pieces Dave initially had:\n   - Total pieces = Number of boxes * Pieces per box = 12 boxes * 3 pieces/box.\n\n2. Calculate the number of chocolate candy pieces Dave gave to his little brother:\n   - Pieces given = Number of boxes given * Pieces per box = 5 boxes * 3 pieces/box.\n\n3.

Calculate the total number of customers served, which is 7.\n2. Determine the number of customers who left a tip by subtracting the customers who did not leave a tip from the total number of customers.\n3. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the tip amount ($3) by the number of customers who left a tip.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total earnings based on the given information. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_earnings(TotalCustomers, CustomersWithoutTip, TipAmount, TotalEarnings)` that calculates the total earnings.\n2. Calculate the number of customers who left a tip by subtracting the customers without a tip from the total number of customers.\n3. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the tip amount by the number of customers who left a tip.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total earnings\ntotal_earnings(TotalCustomers, CustomersWithoutTip, TipAmount, TotalEarnings) :-\n    CustomersWithTip is TotalCustomers - CustomersWithoutTip,\n    TotalEarnings is CustomersWithTip * TipAmount.\n\n% Given values from the problem\nTotalCustomers = 7,\nCustomersWithoutTip = 5,\nTipAmount = 3,\n\n% Calculate the total earnings\ntotal_earnings(TotalCustomers, CustomersWithoutTip, TipAmount, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total earnings of the waiter based on the number of customers who left a tip and the tip amount. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given values and outputs the total earnings.",

The task is to determine how many packages Sarah could make if she were to put 8 cupcakes in each package.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Sarah has left after Todd ate some.\n2. Divide the remaining number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package to find out how many packages she can make.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of packages Sarah can make. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `cupcakes_left` that calculates the number of cupcakes Sarah has left after Todd ate some.\n2. Define a rule `packages_made` that calculates the number of packages Sarah can make based on the remaining cupcakes and the number of cupcakes in each package.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and determine the number of packages Sarah can make.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code might look based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of cupcakes Sarah baked and the number Todd ate\ntotal_cupcakes(38).\ncupcakes_ate(14).\n\n% Calculate the number of cupcakes Sarah has left\ncupcakes_left(CupcakesLeft) :-\n    total_cupcakes(TotalCupcakes),\n    cupcakes_ate(CupcakesAte),\n    CupcakesLeft is TotalCupcakes - CupcakesAte.\n\n% Calculate the number of packages Sarah can make\npackages_made(CupcakesLeft, CupcakesPerPackage, Packages) :-\n    Packages is CupcakesLeft // CupcakesPerPackage.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the total number of cupcakes baked, the number Todd ate, calculates the remaining cupcakes, and then determines the number of packages Sarah can make based on the remaining cupcakes and the number of cupcakes per package. The code leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "question": "Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Nancy uploaded a total of 41 pictures to Facebook. She placed 37 pictures into one album and distributed the remaining pictures into two different albums. The task is to determine how many pictures were placed in each of the two additional albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures uploaded by Nancy: 41 pictures.\n2. Determine the number of pictures in the first album: 37 pictures.\n3. Calculate the number of pictures distributed among the two additional albums by subtracting the pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures.\n4.
