                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nJo-Bob's hot air balloon ride involves alternating periods of ascent and descent based on whether he pulls the lift chain or releases it. The balloon ascends at a rate of 50 feet per minute when the lift chain is pulled and descends at 10 feet per minute when the chain is not being pulled. He pulls the chain for two separate intervals of 15 minutes each and releases it for an interval of 10 minutes in between these periods. The task is to calculate the highest elevation reached during this ride.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the initial ascent: Jo-Bob pulls the chain for 15 minutes, causing the balloon to rise at 50 feet per minute.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n2. Calculate the descent after the first ascent: Jo-Bob releases the chain for 10 minutes, causing the balloon to descend at 10 feet per minute.\n   - Total descent = 10 minutes * 10 feet/minute = 100 feet.\n3. Calculate the second ascent: Jo-Bob again pulls the chain for 15 minutes at the same ascent rate.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n4. Calculate the highest elevation reached by adding the net gain after the first descent to the second ascent.\n   - Highest elevation = first ascent - first descent + second ascent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to model the balloon's behavior during ascent and descent and to calculate the highest elevation reached. The steps to construct the code are:\n\n1. Define predicates for ascent and descent that calculate the total change in height based on time and rate:\n   - `ascent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n   - `descent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n2. Define a predicate `balloon_ride` that calculates the highest elevation reached by using the ascent and descent predicates and considering the sequence of actions:\n   - `balloon_ride(HighestElevation) :- ascent(15, 50, Ascent1), descent(10, 10, Descent1), ascent(15, 50, Ascent2), HighestElevation is Ascent1 - Descent1 + Ascent2.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the highest elevation:\n   - `?- balloon_ride(HighestElevation).`\n4. The code will use logical inference to determine the total heights for each ascent and descent phase and combine these to find the highest elevation reached.\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to model and solve the problem based on the given conditions of the balloon's ascent and descent rates and the times Jo-Bob pulls or releases the chain."

After accumulating his earnings for four weeks, he makes two sequential purchases: first, he spends half of his total savings on a video game, and then he spends a quarter of the remaining amount on a book. The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

After further campaigning, a fifth of the remaining students (who were not already considering him) decided to vote for him.\n   - Remaining students after 30 commitments = 60 - 30 = 30 students\n   - Initially undecided but considering = 5\n   - Remaining students not considering Alec initially = 30 - 5 = 25\n   - Additional votes after campaigning = 1/5 of 25 = 5 votes\n\n4. **Total Votes After Campaigning**: Sum of votes from committed and persuaded students.\n   - Total votes after initial and additional campaigning = 30 (initially committed) + 5 (initially undecided) + 5 (converted from non-considering) = 40 votes\n\n5. **Votes Needed to Reach Goal**: Subtract the total votes Alec has from the required votes.\n   - Additional votes needed = 45 (goal) - 40 (current) = 5 votes\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how many more votes Alec needs based on the input parameters.

The blue weights each weigh 2 pounds, and the green weights each weigh 3 pounds. He uses 4 blue weights and 5 green weights. Additionally, the bar itself has a weight of 2 pounds. To find the total weight of the bar with the weights, we need to calculate the weight contributed by each color of weight and add it to the bar's weight.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by calculating the total weight for each type of weight and then adding these weights together along with the bar's weight:\n1. Calculate the total weight of the blue weights: Number of blue weights multiplied by the weight of each blue weight.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the green weights: Number of green weights multiplied by the weight of each green weight.\n3. Add the weights of the blue and green weights to the weight of the bar to get the total weight.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total weight based on the given input of the number of each type of weight and the weight of the bar. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_weight` that takes five parameters: the number of blue weights (`NumBlue`), the number of green weights (`NumGreen`), the weight of each blue weight (`WeightBlue`), the weight of each green weight (`WeightGreen`), and the weight of the bar (`WeightBar`).\n2. Calculate the total weight contributed by the blue weights as `NumBlue * WeightBlue`.\n3. Calculate the total weight contributed by the green weights as `NumGreen * WeightGreen`.\n4. Sum the weights from the blue weights, green weights, and the bar to get the `TotalWeight`.\n5. Use swi-prolog's ability to perform arithmetic operations and unify the result with `TotalWeight`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total weight\ntotal_weight(NumBlue, NumGreen, WeightBlue, WeightGreen, WeightBar, TotalWeight) :-\n    TotalBlueWeight is NumBlue * WeightBlue,\n    TotalGreenWeight is NumGreen * WeightGreen,\n    TotalWeight is TotalBlueWeight + TotalGreenWeight + WeightBar.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total weight\n% ?- total_weight(4, 5, 2, 3, 2, TotalWeight).\n% This should output the total weight with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total weight of Harry's custom weight bar setup using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing the power of Prolog in handling mathematical tasks through logical rules."

The task is to determine the number of cats remaining in the store after the sale.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves subtracting the number of cats sold from the initial stock of cats in the store. We need to consider two types of cats: Siamese and house cats, and perform a single subtraction to find the total number of cats left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a simple rule that calculates the number of cats remaining based on the initial counts of each type of cat and the number sold during the sale.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFaye has a substantial homework load, comprising 46 math problems and 9 science problems. However, she's fortunate enough to complete a significant portion of them during school hours. The remaining problems need to be tackled at home. The task is to determine the total number of problems Faye has to tackle after finishing her in-school work.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to calculate the number of problems remaining after Faye's in-school efforts. This can be broken down into two components: math problems and science problems.\n\n1. Math Problems:\n   - Total math problems: 46\n   - Problems completed in school: 40\n   - Remaining math problems: 46 - 40 = 6 problems\n\n2.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `remaining_problems` with six variables:\n   - `math_total` for the total number of math problems.\n   - `math_done` for the number of math problems done in school.\n   - `science_total` for the total number of science problems.\n   - `science_done` to represent the number of science problems done (not available).\n   - `remaining_math` to hold the number of remaining math problems.\n   - `total_remaining` to store the final answer, representing the total number of problems left.\n\n2. Calculate the number of remaining math problems by subtracting `math_done` from `math_total`.\n\n3. Set the number of remaining science problems equal to `science_total`, as we don't have information about problems done in school for science.\n\n4. Sum up the remaining math and science problems to find the `total_remaining` problems.\n\n5. Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and find the solution.\n\nThe Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_problems(MathTotal, MathDone, ScienceTotal, RemainingMath, TotalRemaining) :-\n    RemainingMath is MathTotal - MathDone,\n    TotalRemaining is RemainingMath + ScienceTotal.\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how Prolog can be used to logically break down a problem and perform calculations, providing a concise and effective solution.",

She plans to remove a significant number of them, and the task is to determine how many files will remain on her flash drive after the deletion.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves simple subtraction to find the remaining number of files. We need to subtract the number of deleted files from the initial total of files.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code can be structured simply to perform the arithmetic operation involved.

He first purchases 11 games from a friend and later adds to his haul by buying 22 more games at a garage sale. Unfortunately, some of the games turn out to be duds, with 19 of them being non-functional. The actual number of functional, playable games is the remaining count. The task is to calculate how many good games Ned has in his collection after this disappointing revelation.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Ned starts with 11 games from his friend.\n2. He then adds 22 more games from the garage sale, increasing his collection's size.\n3. However, 19 of these games are non-functional, so they don't count as good games.\n4. The remaining functional games are the ones we need to calculate.\n\nTo find the number of good games, we need to perform the following steps:\n- Calculate the total number of games acquired.\n- Subtract the number of non-working games to determine the number of good games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the number of good games based on the games acquired and the number of non-working ones.

She scored 40 points in the first round and improved her score in the second round by adding 10 points. However, she experienced a minor setback in the third and final round, losing 4 points. The task is to determine Chloe's final score after this last round.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into three sequential additions and subtractions:\n\n1. First round score: 40 points.\n2. Second round change: Add 10 points to the first round score.\n   - Second round score = 40 points + 10 points = 50 points.\n3. Third round change: Subtract 4 points from the second round score.\n   - Final score = 50 points - 4 points = 46 points.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this sequential calculation in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that traces the score's progression through each round.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJohn expanded his game collection by purchasing a bulk of games from two different sources. Unfortunately, some of the games he acquired were non-functional. The goal is to determine the number of games that are actually playable, i.e., the \"good games\" among his purchases.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to calculate the total number of games John bought and then subtract the number of non-working games to find the number of good games.\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. John bought 21 games from a friend.\n2. He bought an additional 8 games at a garage sale.\n3. Subtract the 23 non-working games from the total working games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the number of good games based on the games purchased from different sources and the number of non-working ones. Here's how the Prolog code can be organized:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_good_games` that incorporates variables for games purchased from the friend, games purchased at the sale, and the number of non-working games.\n2. Calculate the total number of games by summing the games from both sources.\n3. Subtract the number of non-working games from the total to determine the number of good games.\n4. Use the actual values provided in the problem for testing the rule.\n\nThe step-by-step breakdown of the code structure is as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_games(GamesFromFriend, GamesFromSale, TotalGames)` that calculates the total games based on the purchases from different sources.\n2. Define the main predicate `number_of_good_games` that uses the total games and subtracts the number of non-working games to find the final count.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is`) and logical inference to deduce the result.\n\nFollowing this approach, the Prolog code will efficiently compute the number of good games John ended up with after his purchases.

This will give us the count of working games that Edward can actually play.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that determines the number of good games based on the total games purchased and the count of non-working ones. Here's a detailed roadmap for constructing the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_good_games` that accepts variables for the total games purchased and the number of non-working games, and returns the count of good games.\n2. Subtract the number of non-working games from the total purchased games to find the number of good games.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's basic arithmetic operations to perform this subtraction.\n4. Write the query with the actual values mentioned in the problem statement to obtain the correct answer.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\nnumber_of_good_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames) :-\n    GoodGames is TotalGames - NonWorkingGames.\n\nedward_games :-\n    number_of_good_games(41 + 14, 31, GoodGames),\n    write(GoodGames).\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a clear relationship between the variables, allowing Prolog's logical inference engine to deduce the correct answer.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKatie and her sister combined their Halloween candy hauls, which were 10 pieces and 6 pieces respectively. After a fun first night of indulging, they ate 9 pieces of candy together. The remaining question is to determine how many pieces of candy are left for the two sisters.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved by performing a simple arithmetic calculation. The initial total candy count is obtained by adding Katie's candy to her sister's, resulting in 10 + 6 = 16 pieces. After the first night's indulgence, the remaining candy is found by subtracting the eaten pieces from the initial total: 16 - 9 = 7 pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog using a straightforward approach. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `remaining_candy` that takes the number of pieces Katie has and the number of pieces her sister has.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKaleb initially had a collection of 34 books. He decided to declutter and sell 17 of them, which would presumably give him some money. Using this earned money, Kaleb intends to purchase new books. After this series of events, the question arises: how many books will Kaleb have in his possession?\n\nTo find the final count of Kaleb's books, we need to start by determining the number of books sold, which will then reduce the total number of his initial books. The money obtained from this sale will then be used to determine the number of new books Kaleb can purchase. Finally, we must calculate the total number of books by adding the remaining old books to the newly purchased ones.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down this problem into a series of steps that will help us find the final number of books:\n\n1. We first need to establish the number of books sold, which is 17, and subtract this from Kaleb's initial count of 34 books to determine the number of remaining old books.\n\n2. Next, we'll use the earned money (represented by the number of books sold) to buy new books. Since the question doesn't provide an exact price per book, we'll let the number of new books be a variable, which we'll calculate based on the number of books sold.\n\n3. Finally, we'll add the count of new books to the count of remaining old books to find the total number of books in Kaleb's possession.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog's logic and arithmetic capabilities to construct a clear and concise code that solves this problem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_old_books(InitialCount, BooksSold, RemainingBooks)` that calculates the number of books Kaleb has left from his initial stack after selling some of them.\n\n2.

The task is to determine Adam's current total money.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves a simple sequence of financial transactions: a deduction followed by an addition. The analysis can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Adam starts with $5.\n2. He spends $2 on a game, leaving him with $5 - $2 = $3.\n3. He receives $5 as allowance, which adds to his remaining amount. The final total is calculated by adding this allowance to the post-purchase amount: $5 + $3 = $8.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will embody this sequential financial transaction, using addition as the primary operation. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule, say `adam_s_money`, that represents Adam's total money at each stage and takes appropriate variables.\n2. Initialize Adam's initial money to $5.\n3. Subtract $2 to account for the game purchase.\n4. Add the allowance of $5 to the remaining amount after the purchase.\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the number of students in the fourth grade class after student turnover during the academic year. The class started with 40 students, then some left, and new students joined. To find the final count, we must account for both the students who left and the ones who joined.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by considering the two separate events\u2014students leaving and new students arriving\u2014and determining the net change in the number of students.\n\n1. Students leaving: 14 students departed.\n2. New students arriving: 26 students enrolled.\n\nTo find the final number of students, we subtract the number of departing students from the initial count and then add the number of students who joined.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to logically infer and calculate the final number of students using the provided information. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule, `fourth_grade_students`, which represents the problem's logical inference. This rule should take the initial number of students as one parameter and the number of students who left and joined as separate parameters.\n2. Subtract the number of students who left from the initial count to determine the intermediate count after departures.\n3. Add the number of new students who arrived to the intermediate count to find the final number of students.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and logical inference to guide the computation.\n\nThe Prolog code will be constructed as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `fourth_grade_solution(InitialCount, Left, Joined, FinalCount)` that represents the problem logic.\n2. Calculate `IntermediateCount` by subtracting the number of students who left from the initial count.\n3. Calculate `FinalCount` by adding the number of new students to the `IntermediateCount`.\n4. Execute the rule with the given values to compute the final number of students.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's strength in handling logical relationships and simple arithmetic to solve a real-world problem involving changes in a student population over time.",

The question is to determine Wendy's total lives after this sequence of life changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves a straightforward sequence of gaining and losing lives in the video game. We need to calculate the number of lives lost in the challenging part and then add the lives gained in the next level to the remaining lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that models the life changes Wendy experiences in the game. The plan involves the following steps:\n\n1. Define a rule `wendy_lives` that takes the initial number of lives (`InitialLives`), lives lost (`LivesLost`), and lives gained (`LivesGained`) as parameters.\n2. Calculate the remaining lives after the difficult part by subtracting the lives lost from the initial lives: `RemainingLives = InitialLives - LivesLost`.\n3.

We start with four books, remove three sales, and then add ten new books. The difference between the initial count and the number of books added after sales gives us the number of books remaining in the bin.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we will define a logical rule that computes the total number of books using the initial count and the number of books added after sales. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRachel, while playing a video game, starts with 10 lives. She faces a challenging part of the game and loses four lives in the process. After this difficult section, she enters the next level, where she gains 26 lives for completing it. The question is to determine the total number of lives Rachel has after this addition of lives in the next level.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves a straightforward addition of lives gained in the next level to the remaining lives from the previous level. We need to calculate:\n\n1. The number of lives remaining after the challenging part: 10 lives - 4 lost lives = 6 lives.\n2. The total number of lives after gaining the bonus lives in the next level: 6 lives + 26 bonus lives = ?\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will involve defining a simple rule that subtracts the lives lost and then adds the lives gained to determine the final number of lives. We will make use of Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform this addition. The structure of the code will be as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_lives` that takes the initial_lives and lives_lost as input and calculates the remaining lives after the challenging part.\n2. Define another predicate `total_lives` that adds the bonus_lives to the remaining lives obtained from the previous step.\n3. Use these predicates in conjunction with Prolog's arithmetic operations to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_lives(InitialLives, LivesLost, RemainingLives) :-\n    RemainingLives is InitialLives - LivesLost.\n\ntotal_lives(RemainingLives, BonusLives, TotalLives) :-\n    TotalLives is RemainingLives + BonusLives.\n\nrachel_lives(InitialLives, LivesLost, BonusLives, TotalLives) :-\n    remaining_lives(InitialLives, LivesLost, RemainingLives),\n    total_lives(RemainingLives, BonusLives, TotalLives).\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to perform arithmetic computations and its logical reasoning to solve this problem efficiently.

Haley's sister then steps in, adding 19 pieces to Haley's stash. The question is, how many pieces of candy does Haley have in her possession after these transactions?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves simple addition and subtraction of the candy pieces. We need to subtract the candy Haley ate from her initial stash and then add the new pieces her sister provided.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured around a single predicate that calculates the final number of candy pieces. We will break down the problem into two steps, first accounting for the candy Haley ate, and then adding the new candy.\n\n1.

        "question": "For the school bake sale Carol made 19 cupcakes. If she sold 6 of them and then made 27 more, how many cupcakes would she have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nCarol initially baked 19 cupcakes for the school bake sale but sold 6 of them, leaving her with only 13 cupcakes. She plans to restock the sale by baking an additional 27 cupcakes. The task is to determine the total number of cupcakes Carol will have after this second baking session.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves basic arithmetic calculations to find the total number of cupcakes. We need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of cupcakes left unsold after the first baking session: Initial cupcakes baked (19) minus the number of sold cupcakes (6).\n2. Add the number of cupcakes from the second baking session to the remaining cupcakes from the first session.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be constructed to reflect the sequential events and calculate the final count of cupcakes. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_cupcakes` to represent the first batch of cupcakes baked by Carol.\n2. Define a predicate `sold_cupcakes` to represent the number of cupcakes sold from the initial batch.\n3. Calculate the number of remaining cupcakes by subtracting the sold cupcakes from the initial batch.\n4. Define a predicate `second_batch` to represent the additional cupcakes Carol plans to bake.\n5. Add the number of cupcakes from the second batch to the remaining cupcakes from the first batch.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to find the total number of cupcakes.\n\nThe code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_cupcakes(19).\nsold_cupcakes(6).\nremaining_cupcakes(Remaining) :-\n    initial_cupcakes(Initial),\n    sold_cupcakes(Sold),\n    Remaining is Initial - Sold.\nsecond_batch(27).\ntotal_cupcakes(Total) :-\n    remaining_cupcakes(Remaining),\n    second_batch(New),\n    Total is Remaining + New.\n\n?- total_cupcakes(TotalCupcakes).\n```\n\nThis code uses simple arithmetic operations and the defined predicates to guide SWI-Prolog in calculating the correct total number of cupcakes.

After this purchase, Victor continues his arcade adventures and wins an additional 39 tickets. The task is to calculate the total number of tickets Victor has in possession after this new addition.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to perform the following steps to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThis problem involves a scenario where there's a line for bumper cars at a fair, and people either join or leave the line, causing fluctuations in the number of people waiting. Initially, there are 7 people in line, but 4 get tired of waiting and leave. After this, 8 more people join the line. The task is to determine the final count of people in line.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to perform the following calculations to arrive at the solution:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of people in line (7).\n2. Subtract the number of people who left due to long wait times (4).\n3. Add the number of people who joined the line subsequently (8).\n\n### Plan: SWI-Prolog Implementation\n\nWe will structure the SWI-Prolog code to mimic the sequence of events and calculate the final count of people in line. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_line` to represent the initial number of people in line.\n2. Define a predicate `people_left` to capture the number of people who left the line.\n3. Define a predicate `new_people_joined` to account for the people who joined the line after some left.\n4. Define a predicate `final_count` to compute and return the total number of people in line after the sequence of events.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to solve for the final count by combining the defined predicates.\n\nThe code structure will look like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_line(7).\npeople_left(4).\nnew_people_joined(8).\n\nfinal_count(Final) :-\n    initial_line(Initial),\n    people_left(Left),\n    new_people_joined(Joined),\n    Final is Initial - Left + Joined.\n```\n\nWe can then query this predicate with `final_count(X)` to let Prolog infer and return the final number of people in line.

Specifically, she removes 8 songs and then adds 10 new songs.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe school cafeteria has a certain number of apples, and they use two of them for lunch. After this, they restock by buying a known number of apples. The task is to calculate the total number of apples in the cafeteria post this transaction.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to perform the following steps to arrive at the solution:\n\n1. Start with the initial count of 17 apples.\n2. Subtract the number of apples used for lunch (2 apples).\n3. Add the number of apples purchased later (23 apples).\n4. Compute the final count of apples.\n\n### Plan: SWI-Prolog Code Structure:\n\nWe will create a structured Prolog code to represent the problem and compute the solution. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a simple predicate `initial_apples(Count)` to represent the initial count of apples, where `Count` is the number of apples they had initially.\n\n2. Define a predicate `used_for_lunch(Count)` to represent the number of apples used for lunch. This will be a constant value of 2.\n\n3. Define a predicate `bought_later(Count)` to represent the number of apples bought later. This will also be a constant value of 23.\n\n4. Create a predicate `final_count(InitialCount, FinalCount)` that computes the final number of apples based on the initial count and the subsequent additions/subtractions. This will be the main predicate we will query to find our answer.\n\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to infer the final count of apples.\n\nThe code will linearly progress through these predicates, computing the values step by step until we reach the final count.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code could be written based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_apples(17).\nused_for_lunch(2).\nbought_later(23).\n\nfinal_count(InitialCount, FinalCount) :-\n    NewCount1 is InitialCount - 2,\n    FinalCount is NewCount1 + 23.\n\n?- final_count(InitialCount, FinalCount), initial_apples(InitialCount).\n```\n\nThis code will correctly infer that the school cafeteria would have 38 apples after the transaction.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJanet, while playing a video game, had a substantial number of lives at 47. However, the difficulty of the game took a toll on her lives, resulting in a loss of 23 of them. Fortunately, the next level proved more forgiving, awarding her with 46 additional lives. The question now arises: how many lives does Janet have after this tumultuous gaming journey?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be approached by simply subtracting the lives lost from the initial number of lives and then adding the lives gained in the next level.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe solution to this problem can be modeled using SWI-Prolog code with a straightforward application of addition and subtraction. The following steps will be taken:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_lives` to represent the number of lives Janet has at the beginning.\n2. Define a predicate `lives_lost` to represent the number of lives lost during the challenging part of the game.\n3.

We need to sum the number of remaining cupcakes from the first batch and the newly baked cupcakes from the second batch.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the total number of cupcakes based on the input values for the initial and second batches of cupcakes. The steps to construct this code are as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_cupcakes` that takes two variables: one for the initial batch of cupcakes and another for the second batch.\n2. Use addition to calculate the total number of cupcakes.\n3. Provide the actual values for the initial and second batches when querying the rule to obtain the solution.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of the code structure:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_batch(Number)` to represent the first batch of cupcakes.\n2. Define a predicate `second_batch(Number)` to represent the second batch of cupcakes Robin baked.\n3. Define the main predicate `total_cupcakes` that calculates the total by adding the cupcakes from both batches.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations (`+`) to perform the addition.\n\nThis straightforward approach utilizes Prolog's ability to perform arithmetic computations to solve this simple mathematical problem.\n\nNow, let's see the actual Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_batch(20). % Remaining cupcakes after selling 22\nsecond_batch(39).\n\ntotal_cupcakes(TotalCupcakes) :-\n    initial_batch(Initial),\n    second_batch(Second),\n    TotalCupcakes is Initial + Second.\n```\n\nWith this code in place, we can query the total number of cupcakes by calling `?- total_cupcakes(X).`, and Prolog will infer the correct answer.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe need to determine the total number of students in the fourth grade after some students left the class and many new students joined throughout the year. The initial count of students was four, and three students left, which reduces the count to one. After this, 42 new students joined. We need to calculate the final count of students in the fourth grade.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves a straightforward calculation of the final student count: we start with four students, subtract three who left, and then add 42 new students.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be constructed to reflect the sequential nature of the events: first, the departure of students, followed by the arrival of new students. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. Define a rule `students_left` that subtracts the number of students who left from the initial count, resulting in the intermediate count.\n2. Define a rule `final_count` that adds the number of new students to the intermediate count obtained in the previous step.\n3. Use actual values (4 initial students, 3 students left) in the `students_left` rule and let the `final_count` rule compute the final student count based on the result.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Initialize the number of students\ninitial_count(4).\n\n% Handle the students who left\nstudents_left(InitialCount, LeftCount) :- LeftCount is InitialCount - 3.\n\n% Calculate the final count after new students join\nfinal_count(LeftCount, NewStudents, FinalCount) :- FinalCount is LeftCount + NewStudents.\n\n% Query to find the final count of students\n?- students_left(initial_count(4), left_students(X)), final_count(left_students(X), 42, final_number_of_students(Y)).\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define the initial count of students, then use a predicate to keep track of the students who left, and finally, determine the final count after the new students join.

        "question": "Paul bought 6 boxes of chocolate candy and 4 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 9 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nPaul purchased candies for distribution among his friends or for some event. He bought six boxes of chocolate candies and four boxes of caramel candies, and each box contains nine pieces. The task is to calculate the total number of candies Paul has.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved by aggregating the candies from both types of boxes. The number of candies in each box is the same, containing nine pieces. Therefore, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of candies in each box to obtain the total count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe plan for constructing the SWI-Prolog code involves setting up a logical relationship between the number of boxes and the candies inside each box, and then multiplying these quantities to obtain the total candy count. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a variable for the number of candies in each box. We'll call this `CandiesPerBox`.\n2. Define the number of boxes for each type of candy. We'll use `ChocolateBoxes` for the number of chocolate candy boxes and `CaramelBoxes` for the caramel candy boxes.\n3. Calculate the total number of candies for each type: \n   - `TotalChocolateCandies is ChocolateBoxes * CandiesPerBox`.\n   - `TotalCaramelCandies is CaramelBoxes * CandiesPerBox`.\n\n4. Sum up the total candies from both types to find the grand total:\n   - `TotalCandies is TotalChocolateCandies + TotalCaramelCandies`.\n\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and obtain the final answer.\n\nThe resulting Prolog code will be a logical representation of this problem-solving strategy, enabling the inference engine to deduce the correct total candy count.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's simplicity in coding logical relationships and its ability to handle arithmetic computations.

Sum up the cans collected on both days to find the total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to create a logical representation of this problem and guide the solver through the steps outlined in the analysis. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a constant for the number of cans per bag.\n2. Create a predicate `bags_collected(Day, Number)` to represent the number of bags collected on a given day.\n3. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the total cans collected on each day by multiplying the number of bags and the cans per bag.\n4. Sum up the cans from both days to find the final total.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will leverage the logical relationships and arithmetic operations available in the language.

To solve this, we need to calculate the product of the number of players and the lives per player.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe require the total lives which can be found by multiplying the number of players by the lives per player. We can represent the number of players as a variable `NumberOfPlayers` and the lives per player as `LivesPerPlayer`. The total lives will be the product of these two values.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe strategy to solve this using SWI-Prolog involves setting up a straightforward rule that computes the total lives based on the input parameters.

The task is to calculate the total time Wendy spent putting all these furniture pieces together. Each piece reportedly took 6 minutes to assemble, and we need to find the total of these minutes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total time, we need to sum the time taken for each individual piece of furniture. With four chairs and four tables, we have:\n\n1. Chairs: 4 chairs * 6 minutes each = 24 minutes\n2. Tables: 4 tables * 6 minutes each = 24 minutes\n\nThe total time spent is the sum of these two values.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this straightforward problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that multiplies the number of furniture pieces by the time taken for each. We can then use this rule to calculate the total time spent on assembly.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `furniture_assembly(NumFurniture, Time)` where `NumFurniture` represents the number of furniture pieces and `Time` is the time taken to assemble each piece (6 minutes in this case).\n2.

The task is to calculate the total amount of money spent when Edward and his friend each buy four decks.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total amount spent, we need to multiply the cost per deck by the number of decks purchased by both Edward and his friend.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that computes the total expenditure based on the cost per deck and the number of decks purchased by each individual. SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions will be employed to perform the multiplication operation. The following is a step-by-step breakdown of how we will achieve this:\n\n1.

        "question": "Faye was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 3 bead necklaces and 7 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 7 dollars, how much money did she earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFaye is running a garage sale and has sold multiple necklaces, including bead necklaces and gemstone necklaces, each with a specific price per necklace. The task is to calculate the total earnings from the sale of these necklaces.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward calculation of the total earnings from the necklaces. We need to multiply the number of bead necklaces sold by the price per bead necklace, and do the same for the gemstone necklaces. Then, we sum these two amounts to find the total earnings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a clear and concise rule that takes into account the number of each type of necklace sold and the corresponding price. We then perform arithmetic operations to calculate the total earnings. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `necklace_cost` that assigns the cost per bead necklace and the cost per gemstone necklace.\n2. Define another predicate `total_earnings` that takes the number of bead necklaces and gemstone necklaces sold as arguments and calculates the total earnings by multiplying the number of necklaces by their respective costs and then adding these amounts.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform the multiplication and addition.\n4. Query the rule with the given values (3 bead necklaces and 7 gemstone necklaces) to obtain the total earnings.\n\nThe corresponding Prolog code could be written as follows:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost of each type of necklace\nnecklace_cost(bead, 7).\nnecklace_cost(gemstone, 7).\n\n% Calculate total earnings from necklace sales\ntotal_earnings(BeadNecklaces, GemstoneNecklaces, TotalEarnings) :-\n    TotalBeadEarnings is BeadNecklaces * 7,   % Cost of bead necklaces is $7\n    TotalGemstoneEarnings is GemstoneNecklaces * 7,  % Cost of gemstone necklaces is also $7\n    TotalEarnings is TotalBeadEarnings + TotalGemstoneEarnings.\n\n% Example query with Faye's sales\n?- total_earnings(3, 7, Total).\n% This should return the total amount of money Faye earned.\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's simplicity in defining logical relationships and its ability to handle basic arithmetic operations, making it a concise and effective solution.",

The task is to calculate the total number of tickets Oliver used during his carnival visit.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved by performing the following calculations:\n\n1. Multiply the number of times Oliver rode the Ferris wheel (5 times) by the cost of each ride (7 tickets).\n2. Do the same for the bumper cars (4 times x 7 tickets per ride).\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a waiter is attending to multiple tables, with a specified number of women and men at each table. The goal is to calculate the total number of customers the waiter is serving. This involves multiplying the number of women and men at each table and then adding these totals together.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. The waiter has been described as having multiple tables to attend to, with a fixed number of women and men at each table. We need to capture this setup in our logic.\n2. We should multiply the number of women and men at one table to find the total number of customers for a single table.\n3. Finally, we'll multiply this single table total by the number of tables to arrive at the overall total customers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a clear and concise rule that calculates the total number of customers based on the input of the number of women and men per table and the total number of tables. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `customers_per_table` that takes in the number of women (`Women`) and men (`Men`) at one table and returns the total number of customers for that table.\n2. Multiply the number of women and men to find the table's customer count: `Customers = Women * Men`.\n3. Define the main predicate `total_customers` that combines the results from multiple tables. It should take the number of tables as an input and return the total customers across all tables.\n4. Multiply the `Customers per Table` by the `Number of Tables` to get the `Total Customers`.\n\nThe Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\ncustomers_per_table(Women, Men, Customers) :- Customers is Women * Men.\n\ntotal_customers(Tables, Total) :-\n    customers_per_table(4, 3, Customers),  % Assuming 4 women and 3 men per table\n    Total is Tables * Customers.\n```\n\nThis code uses the logical relationships and arithmetic operations provided in the problem statement. We leverage Prolog's strength in reasoning and inference to obtain the correct result.\n\nNow, running the query with the provided values will give us the total number of customers.",

We need to multiply the number of mystery books per shelf and the total number of mystery shelves, and do the same for the picture books.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe pet store has multiple bird cages, and each cage houses a certain number of parrots and parakeets. The task is to calculate the total number of birds in the store by multiplying the number of birds per cage and the total number of cages.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of birds in the store, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of parrots: Each cage has two parrots, so multiplying the number of cages by 2 will give us the total parrots.\n2. Determine the total number of parakeets: Each cage has seven parakeets, so multiplying the number of cages by 7 provides the total parakeets.\n3. Add the totals of parrots and parakeets to find the overall count of birds in the pet store.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to write a rule that calculates the total number of birds based on the input number of cages, parrots per cage, and parakeets per cage. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_birds` that takes the number of cages as its input.\n2. Calculate the total parrots by multiplying the number of cages by 2, and the total parakeets by multiplying the cages by 7.\n3. Add the totals of parrots and parakeets to obtain the `TotalBirds`.\n4.

She plans ahead by buying a fixed number of tickets, ensuring that her friends and any potential additional companions can attend the concert. The goal is to determine how much Lana spent on these tickets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved by calculating the total cost of the tickets Lana purchased. She bought a fixed number of tickets (8) for herself and her friends and an additional 2 tickets for potential attendees. The cost of an individual ticket is a known factor at $6 each.

Determine the total number of bead necklaces sold (7) and the total number of gemstone necklaces sold (3).\n\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRoger has been organizing his spare change into piles, with three piles each for quarters and dimes. If each of these piles contains 7 coins, the total number of coins can be determined by summing up the coins in all the piles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total number of coins, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1.

Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a constant for the number of quarter piles (`QuarterPiles`) and dime piles (`DimePiles`).\n2. Define a predicate `coins_in_pile` that specifies the number of coins in a single pile (7).\n3. Define a predicate `total_quarters` that multiplies the number of coins in a quarter pile by the total number of quarter piles.\n4. Similarly, define a predicate `total_dimes` for calculating the total dimes.\n5.

When two players join an existing game, the total lives need to be recalculated. Each player starts with 8 lives, and the task is to determine the total number of lives after the new players join.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Recognize that the number of players has increased by 2.\n2. Multiply the number of lives per player (which is 8) by the total number of players after the addition.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the number of players. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_lives(NumberPlayers, LivesEachPlayer, TotalLives)` that calculates the total number of lives. This rule will take the number of players and the lives per player as input and return the total lives.\n\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to multiply `LivesEachPlayer` by `NumberPlayers` to get `TotalLives`.\n\n3.

His score needs to be calculated based on the number of correct answers in each half of the game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. **First Half Performance**: Adam answered 8 questions correctly in the first half, which earned him a certain number of points.\n2. **Second Half Performance**: He answered 2 questions correctly in the second half, contributing to his total score.\n3. **Determine Final Score**: To find Adam's final score, we need to sum up the points from both halves of the game.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to implement a logical inference-based solution to calculate Adam's final score.

The task is to calculate the total number of coins across all the piles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Tom has 2 piles of quarters, and each pile has 5 coins. The total number of quarters is: 2 piles * 5 coins/pile = 10 coins.\n2. Similarly, for the dimes, he has 4 piles, each containing 5 coins.

Sum up the cans collected on both days to find the total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to model this scenario and find the total number of cans. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `cans_on_saturday(TotalSaturday)` which calculates the number of cans Kaleb collected on Saturday. This rule should output the total cans for Saturday.\n2. Define a rule `cans_on_sunday(TotalSunday)` which calculates the number of cans collected on Sunday, outputting this total.\n3. Create a rule `total_cans(TotalSaturday, TotalSunday, FinalTotal)` that sums up the cans collected on both days to provide the overall total.\n\n4. Use these defined rules and instantiate them with the respective bag counts to compute the final total using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code might look like this:\n\n```prolog\ncans_on_saturday(Total) :- Total is 4 * 4.\ncans_on_sunday(Total) :- Total is 6 * 4.\ntotal_cans(SaturdayTotal, SundayTotal, FinalTotal) :- FinalTotal is SaturdayTotal + SundayTotal.\n\nkalebs_total_cans(FinalTotal) :-\n    cans_on_saturday(SaturdayTotal),\n    cans_on_sunday(SundayTotal),\n    total_cans(SaturdayTotal, SundayTotal, FinalTotal).\n```\n\nBy defining these relationships, we can use SWI-Prolog's inference engine to deduce the total number of cans Kaleb has collected over the weekend. This approach leverages Prolog's simplicity in encoding logical relationships and performing arithmetic operations.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRobin has uploaded a total of 40 pictures (35 from her phone and 5 from her camera) and wants to distribute them evenly across 5 different albums. The goal is to determine the number of pictures in each of these albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures are in each album.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe solution in SWI-Prolog will involve a simple division to determine the number of pictures in each album. We can define a rule that takes the total count of pictures and the number of albums as input and returns the number of pictures per album. By structuring the problem this way, we can leverage Prolog's built-in support for arithmetic operations.\n\n1. Define a rule `pics_per_album(TotalPics, Albums, PicsPerAlbum)` that calculates the number of pictures in each album. `TotalPics` represents the total count of pictures, and `Albums` is the number of albums. `PicsPerAlbum` will be the desired output.\n\n2. Use the `//` operator, which performs integer division in Prolog, to divide the total pictures evenly among the albums.\n\n3. Instantiate the rule with the given values: Total pictures (35 + 5 = 40) and number of albums (5).\n\n4. Query the rule to compute and display the number of pictures in each album.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\npics_per_album(TotalPics, Albums, PicsPerAlbum) :-\n    PicsPerAlbum is TotalPics // Albums.\n\n?- pics_per_album(40, 5, PicsPerAlbum).\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's simplicity in handling arithmetic operations to find the solution using the provided constraints.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRoger's task of picking up lunch trays involves him making trips while carrying a limited number of trays at once. To determine the number of trips he will make, we need to divide the total number of trays into groups of four, as that is the most Roger can carry simultaneously.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by first calculating the total number of trays that need to be picked up (10 trays from one table + 2 trays from another = 12 trays in total). Then, we can determine the number of trips required by dividing this total count by the maximum number of trays Roger can carry per trip.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the number of trips based on the given data. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_trays` that specifies the total number of trays Roger needs to pick up (10 from the first table and 2 from the second, totaling 12 trays).\n2. Define a rule `max_trays_per_trip` that specifies the maximum number of trays Roger can carry in one trip, which is 4 trays.\n3. Use division to calculate the number of trips required. Since the total number of trays cannot be divided evenly by the maximum per-trip count, we round up to the nearest integer, as Roger will make one more trip to carry the remaining trays.\n\n4.

        "question": "Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 4 people and there are 2 students and 6 adults going, how many vans will they need?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe goal is to determine the minimum number of vans required to transport students and adults from Debby's class to the zoo when each van can accommodate four people. The group consists of two students and six adults. The task involves finding a way to divide the attendees into vans while ensuring that each van's occupancy adheres to the specified capacity.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people going to the zoo (2 students + 6 adults = 8 people).\n2. Determine the required number of vans by dividing the total number of people by the capacity of each van (4 people).\n3. Compute the remainder when the total number of people is divided by the van capacity, as this will determine the final number of vans needed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to construct a code that logically infers the answer based on the given scenario. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `min_vans(TotalPeople, VanCapacity, RequiredVans)` that calculates the minimum number of vans needed. This predicate will use simple arithmetic to establish the relationship between the total number of people and the van capacity.\n\n2. Instantiate the predicates with the actual values:\n   - TotalPeople: 8 (two students + six adults)\n   - VanCapacity: 4 (capacity of each van)\n\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to find the solution. The `mod` operator can be used to find the remainder of the division, which will determine the final number of vans required if there's an uneven distribution.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured along these lines:\n\n```prolog\n% Define a predicate to calculate the minimum number of vans\nmin_vans(TotalPeople, VanCapacity, RequiredVans) :-\n    RequiredVans is ceil(TotalPeople / VanCapacity).\n\n% Use the predicate with the given values\n?- min_vans(8, 4, RequiredVans).\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's strength in logical reasoning and arithmetic operations to provide a concise and efficient solution to the problem of determining the required number of vans for the field trip.",

        "question": "Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\nHenry's task of collecting lunch trays involves him making multiple trips, as he can only carry a limited number of trays (9) at a time. The problem requires us to calculate the total number of trips he will make to clear all the trays from two different tables.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many trays Henry will carry in each trip and then find how many trips are required to clear all the trays.\n\n1. Trays from the first table: 29 trays need to be picked up, which will require Henry to make 29 / 9 = 3.22 trips (rounded up due to the fractional part).\n2. Trays from the second table: 52 trays need to be picked up, resulting in 52 / 9 = 5.78 trips (rounded up).\n\nSince Henry makes the maximum number of trips for each table, we will consider the higher number of trips from the second table.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog by defining rules that calculate the number of trips required for each table and then return the higher number of these trips. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `tray_trips_first_table(TotalTrays, Trips)` that calculates the number of trips needed to clear a certain number of trays from the first table. The rule will return the ceiling value of the total trays divided by the trays Henry can carry.\n\n2. Define a similar rule `tray_trips_second_table(TotalTrays, Trips)` for the second table.\n\n3.

The task is to determine how many candies Edward can buy with his ticket stash.\n\n### Analysis:\nEdward's total tickets are directly applicable to the number of candies he can buy. Each candy requires a contribution of four tickets, and Edward has eight tickets in total.

The task is to determine how many chicken wings each friend will receive if the wings are distributed equally among them. This is a simple problem of division, where we need to ascertain the quotient of the total number of wings divided by the number of friends.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe are given the total number of chicken wings (9) and the number of friends (3). The solution lies in dividing the total number of wings by the number of friends to find out the equal distribution.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to perform the division and extract the quotient as the solution. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `equal_distribution` that takes the total number of chicken wings and the number of friends as input and calculates the equal distribution.\n\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform the division.\n\n3. Present the result as the number of chicken wings each friend would receive.\n\nThe code structure would be as follows:\n\n```prolog\nequal_distribution(TotalWings, NumFriends, WingsPerFriend) :-\n    WingsPerFriend is TotalWings // NumFriends.\n```\n\nTo solve the problem using this code, we would instantiate `TotalWings` as 9 and `NumFriends` as 3, and query the rule to obtain the answer.\n\nThis straightforward approach leverages Prolog's support for arithmetic operations to provide a concise solution to the problem.",

The task is to calculate how many vases are needed to hold all the flowers. This involves finding the optimal distribution of flowers among the vases without exceeding the capacity of each vase.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of flowers and then determine how many vases are required to accommodate them all.\n\n1. **Total Flowers**: Add the number of carnations and roses.\n2. **Vases Required**: Calculate the minimum number of vases needed by dividing the total number of flowers by the maximum flowers per vase.

To calculate her points, we need to divide the weight she recycled by the rate of 3 pounds per point and then round down the result since earning a fraction of a point doesn't make sense in this context.\n\n2. **Friends' Points**: Her friends recycled 16 pounds, and the points calculation can be done similarly to Haley's.\n\n3. **Total Points**: Sum the points earned by Haley and her friends to find the total points earned by the group.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog's logical reasoning and arithmetic capabilities to compute the points earned by Haley and her friends.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSarah has a capacity constraint when using her washing machine, as it can only accommodate 5 pieces of clothing per cycle. With a large pile of 43 shirts and 2 sweaters to wash, she needs to strategically plan the number of loads required to wash all her clothes. The task is to determine how many loads Sarah will need to complete her laundry.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of loads required, we must calculate how many times Sarah will need to run the washing machine, considering its limited capacity. Here's the approach:\n\n1. Calculate the number of shirts that can be washed in one load. Since the focus is on shirts, we'll start with them.\n2. Determine how many shirts are left after each load to identify when the remaining shirts can fit into a single load.\n3. Include the two sweaters into the remaining shirts load, as the sweaters can be washed along with the shirts.\n4. Calculate the total number of loads required.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll create a SWI-Prolog rule to compute the required number of loads based on the input number of shirts and sweaters. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_loads` that takes the number of shirts (`NumShirts`) and sweaters (`NumSweaters`) as parameters.\n2. Calculate the number of shirts washed in the first load: `ShirtsPerLoad is NumShirts mod 5`.\n3. Subtract the shirts washed in the first load from the total to find the remaining shirts: `RemainingShirts is NumShirts - ShirtsPerLoad`.\n4. Repeat step 2 to determine the number of shirts washed in the next load: `ShirtsPerNextLoad is RemainingShirts mod 5`.\n5. Continue this pattern until the remaining shirts plus the sweaters can fit in one load: `RemainingShirts + NumSweaters <= 5`.\n6. Count the number of completed loads by dividing the remaining shirts by the load capacity, adding the current load number, and initializing a load counter.\n7. Use SWI-Prolog's control constructs, such as `between/3`, to iterate through the loads and keep track of the overall count.\n8.

The chef has a total of 8 cooked chicken wings but cooks an additional 10 wings for the group. The task is to determine how many chicken wings each friend will receive.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of chicken wings each person gets, we need to calculate the total number of wings and then divide this number by the number of friends.\n\n1. Total Chicken Wings: The chef has 8 ready-made wings, and then cooks another 10, making a total of 8 + 10 = 18 chicken wings.\n2. Number of Friends: There are three friends (Friend A, Friend B, and Friend C).\n3. Wings Per Person: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to find the equal share for each person.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Define a constant for the number of initial chicken wings (e.g., `INITIAL_WINGS`).\n2. Define a constant for the number of additional chicken wings cooked (e.g., `ADDITIONAL_WINGS`).\n3.

The task is to determine how many loads she will need to wash to get all the clothes clean. We need to divide the total number of items into groups of nine to find the number of loads required.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of loads, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of clothing items:\n   - Total items = 19 shirts + 8 sweaters\n\n2. Divide the total number of items by the washing machine's capacity:\n   - Number of loads = Total items / 9 (capacity of the machine)\n\n3.

Vanessa's points: Her weight is divisible by 9, so she earned 20 / 9 points.\n2. Friends' points: Their weight is slightly higher than 16 pounds, so their contribution will be calculated as 2 sets of 9 pounds each, with the remaining weight being ignored in this calculation.

The task is to calculate the total points earned by the group, considering Zoe's contribution of 25 pounds and her friends' contribution of 23 pounds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total points, we need to determine how many 8-pound increments can be made from the combined weight of paper recycled by Zoe and her friends. The analysis involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight recycled by adding Zoe's and her friends' contributions: Total Weight = 25 pounds + 23 pounds = 48 pounds.\n2. Divide the total weight by the weight required for one point: Total Weight / 8 pounds/point.\n3. Round down the result to obtain the whole number of points earned, as each point represents an increment of 8 pounds.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to implement this calculation through a defined rule. The plan involves setting up predicates that represent the problem's constraints and performing the necessary arithmetic operations. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `recycled_points(ZoePounds, FriendsPounds, Points)` that represents the main calculation.\n2. Calculate the total weight recycled by summing Zoe's and her friends' contributions: `TotalWeight is ZoePounds + FriendsPounds`.\n3. Divide the `TotalWeight` by `8` to find the number of points earned, and use Prolog's rounding function or arithmetic operations to round down the result to the nearest integer.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's built-in functions and inference capabilities to construct the logical flow and perform the calculations.\n\nThe resulting Prolog code will be a straightforward implementation of this plan, using the predicates and relationships defined above.\n\nThis approach leverages SWI-Prolog's strengths in both logical reasoning and arithmetic computations to solve the practical problem of calculating points earned through recycling efforts.",

        "question": "For a birthday party Tom bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 7 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTom needs to organize the sodas he has purchased for the birthday party into his fridge, which has a capacity of 7 drinks per shelf. The regular sodas are purchased in packs of 4, and the diet sodas come in packs of 7. Tom's goal is to maximize the use of his fridge space while accommodating all the soda packs efficiently.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many shelves Tom will require to fit all the soda packs. We can achieve this by dividing the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf:\n\n1. The number of regular soda packs is 4, which will fit onto one shelf as 4 \u00f7 7 = 0 shelves, with 4 sodas remaining.\n2. The number of diet soda packs is 52, which equals seven 7-soda packs and two extra sodas.\n3. Adding the remaining regular sodas, we have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 extra sodas that don't fit into a full shelf.\n4. Now, we must calculate how many shelves are needed to fit these remaining sodas. Since six sodas remain, we can calculate it using the formula: Ceiling(6 / 7).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of shelves required based on the given pack sizes and fridge shelf capacity. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `regular_sodas(NumPacks)` that represents the number of regular soda packs.\n2. Define a predicate `diet_sodas(NumPacks)` for the number of diet soda packs.\n3. Define a predicate `fridge_capacity(Capacity)` to represent the number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.\n4. Calculate the number of full shelves required for the regular sodas using integer division and get the remainder.\n5. Add the remainder from the regular sodas to the number of diet soda packs.\n6. Calculate the number of shelves needed for the combined remainder using SWI-Prolog's built-in functions for arithmetic and logical inference.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\nregular_sodas(4).\ndiet_sodas(52).\nfridge_capacity(7).\n\nnum_shelves(RegularSodas, DietSodas, Capacity, Shelves) :-\n    RemainingRegular is RegularSodas mod Capacity,\n    RemainingTotal is RemainingRegular + DietSodas,\n    Shelves is ceil(RemainingTotal / Capacity).\n\ntom_soda_shelves(Shelves) :-\n    num_shelves(4, 52, 7, Shelves).\n```\n\nIn this code, the `tom_soda_shelves` predicate provides the solution by calculating the required number of shelves using the defined predicates and Prolog's inference capabilities. This approach leverages the clarity and modularity of Prolog to solve a practical problem efficiently.",

He needs to pick up 23 trays from one table and five trays from another. The task is to determine how many trips Victor will have to make to complete this task.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to divide the total number of trays into groups of seven, the maximum that Victor can carry. Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Calculate the number of trays that need to be picked up from both tables: 23 trays from the first table + 5 trays from the second table = 28 trays in total.\n2. Divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Victor can carry per trip: 28 trays / 7 trays/trip.\n3. If the quotient is the number of trips Victor needs to make, and there's a remainder, add one extra trip.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in swi-prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of trips based on the given scenario. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `number_of_trips(TotalTrays, MaxTraysPerTrip, Trips)` where `TotalTrays` is the total number of trays, `MaxTraysPerTrip` is the maximum trays Victor can carry per trip, and `Trips` is the resulting number of trips.\n2. Calculate the quotient and remainder when dividing the `TotalTrays` by `MaxTraysPerTrip`.\n3.

She wants to organize these pictures into different albums, with each album containing an equal number of pictures. We need to determine how many pictures will be in each album.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1.

Determine the time already spent painting, which is the product of the number of rooms painted (8) and the time taken to paint each room (8 hours).\n2.

The current level has a total of 11 enemies, but the player could only destroy all but three of them. The task is to calculate the total points earned by the player in this level.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo calculate the points earned, we need to determine the number of enemies defeated. The remaining number of enemies is the total number of enemies minus the number of enemies not defeated (undefeated). Once we have the number of enemies defeated, we can multiply this by the points earned per enemy to find the total points.\n\n### Plan:\nWe will create a Prolog rule that takes the total number of enemies in the level and the number of undefeated enemies. We will then compute the number of enemies defeated by subtracting the undefeated enemies from the total. Multiplying the number of defeated enemies by the points per enemy will give us the total points earned.\n\n1. Define a rule `enemy_points` that represents the points earned from defeating enemies.\n2. The rule will take two variables: `TotalEnemies`, the total number of enemies in the level, and `Undefeated`, the number of undefeated enemies.\n3.

She sold all but 6 bars, meaning 7 bars were sold. The revenue depends on the cost per bar and the number of bars sold.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total revenue, we need to determine the number of bars sold and the cost price of each bar. The sold bars are obtained by subtracting the unsold bars from the total bars in the box.

Define a predicate `calculate_installation_time(Count, Time)` that multiplies the count of remaining windows by the time taken for one installation.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform the multiplication.\n\nHere's the SWI-Prolog code outline based on this strategy:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the number of remaining windows\nremaining_windows_count(Total, Installed, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is Total - Installed.\n\n% Calculate the total time required for installation\ncalculate_installation_time(Remaining, Time) :-\n    Time is Remaining * 8.  % Assuming 8 hours per window installation\n\n% Example query to find the time for the remaining installations\n% ?- remaining_windows_count(14, 8, Remaining), calculate_installation_time(Remaining, Time).\n```\n\nThis code uses logical relationships to determine the number of remaining windows and then employs arithmetic operations to find the total time required for their installation. The query provided will output the exact time needed to install the left windows, showcasing Prolog's utility in solving real-world problems.",

The task is to determine the total cost for the entire group. To solve this, we need to differentiate between the number of adults and kids and calculate the cost accordingly.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of adults: Total group size minus the number of kids.\n2. Calculate the cost for adults: Number of adults multiplied by the cost per adult meal.\n3. As kids eat free, there is no additional cost for them, but we should account for their presence by adding a placeholder cost of $0 for each kid.\n4.

The group includes 9 kids and the remaining adults. The task is to determine the overall cost for the entire group to eat.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by breaking down the costs into two categories: adult meals and kid meals.\n\n1. **Adult Meals**: Calculate the cost by multiplying the number of remaining adults (total group size minus kids) by the cost per adult meal.\n2. **Kid Meals**: Since kids eat free, we need to determine the number of kid meals based on the given number of kids and include a cost of $0 for them.\n3. **Total Cost**: Sum the costs of adult and kid meals to find the total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total meal cost based on the given input of the number of kids and adults in the group. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `restaurant_cost` that takes two parameters: `NumKids` and `NumAdults`, representing the numbers of kids and adults in the group.\n2.

We can multiply the number of kids by a cost per kid meal (0), or simply use a fact that represents the zero cost.\n4. Add the costs of adult and kid meals to find the `TotalCost`.\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\nYou're helping to calculate the total cost of a meal for a group with a unique dining offer: adult meals cost $8 each, while kids eat free. The group includes 11 people, with 2 of them being kids. The task is to determine the overall cost of the meal for this group.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of adult meals and then calculate the total cost. Since two members of the group are kids, we'll account for them separately from the remaining adults. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the number of adult meals: Subtract the number of kids from the total group size.\n2. Compute the cost of the adult meals: Multiply the number of adult meals by the cost per adult meal.\n3. Add the cost of the adult meals to derive the total meal cost.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to implement a logical solution to this problem. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `group_meal_cost(GroupSize, KidCount, AdultCost)` where `GroupSize` is the total group size, `KidCount` is the number of kids, and `AdultCost` is the cost of an adult meal.\n2. Calculate the number of adult meals by subtracting the number of kids from the total group size.\n3. Multiply the number of adult meals by the cost per adult meal to get the total cost of adult meals.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform the above calculations and find the total cost.\n\nThe Prolog code will be designed based on this logic, utilizing the power of Prolog for logical reasoning and arithmetic computations.\n\nThis approach breaks down the problem into manageable steps, making the code structure clear and concise, which should help in writing an efficient SWI-Prolog solution.",

The task is to calculate the total amount of money Kaleb spent on riding the Ferris wheel, which can be determined by finding the number of tickets used and multiplying that by the cost per ticket.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to find the difference between the initial and final number of tickets to determine how many tickets were used.

Since each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, Tiffany needs to calculate how much flour is needed to complete the remaining brownies.

Calculate the flour required for the remaining 9 brownies (17 total - 8 baked).\n   - Required flour for the remaining brownies = 9 brownies * 8 cups/brownie = 72 cups\n\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\nYou're faced with a restaurant pricing scenario where adult meals cost a fixed price of $2 each, but kids get to enjoy a free meal. Now, a group of 9 people, including 2 kids, plans to visit the restaurant, and you need to determine the total cost of their meal.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo tackle this problem, the following considerations come into play:\n\n1. **Meal Cost for Adults**: Each adult meal carries a $2 price tag. The number of adults within the group needs to be determined.\n2. **No Cost for Kids**: The two children in the group enjoy a complimentary meal, so their meals don't contribute to the overall cost.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the total cost, factoring in the meals for both adults and kids.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, a systematic approach can be implemented as follows:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Establish a Prolog rule named `restaurant_cost` that computes the total meal cost. This rule should accept the number of adults within the group as an argument and return the total cost.\n2. **Compute Total Cost**: Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal ($2).\n3. **Consider Kids**: Since kids eat free, the number of kids (assumed to be 2) doesn't directly affect the total cost. However, they do impact the number of adults. Subtract the number of kids from the total group size to determine the number of adults.\n4. **Query Execution**: Execute a query to determine the total cost for the group of 9, with 2 of them being kids.\n\nThe Prolog code could be structured as:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the restaurant cost\nrestaurant_cost(NumberOfAdults, TotalCost) :-\n    TotalCost = NumberOfAdults * $2.\n\n% Query to find the total cost for a group of 9 with 2 kids\ntotal_cost_for_group :-\n    restaurant_cost(NumberOfAdults, Cost),\n    NumberOfAdults = 9 - 2, % Calculate number of adults based on total group size and kids\n    write(Cost). % Display the result\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to model real-world scenarios and perform calculations, thereby finding the correct total cost for the group's meal at the restaurant.",

She needs to determine the additional amount of flour required to complete her baking task.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of flour already used: Since Chloe has baked 7 brownies, and each brownie uses 6 cups of flour, we multiply the number of brownies by the flour needed per brownie: 7 brownies * 6 cups/brownie = 42 cups.\n2. Calculate the remaining amount of flour needed: The difference between the desired total and the amount already prepared will give the required flour for completing the task. This can be found by subtracting the number of brownies Chloe has baked (7) from the desired total (16), then multiplying the difference by the flour requirement per brownie (6 cups).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that computes the required amount of flour based on the given information. Here's the detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_flour(BakedBrownies, TotalBrownies, FlourPerBrownie, RequiredFlour)` that takes into account the number of brownies already baked, the desired total number of brownies, the flour used per brownie, and computes the required flour.\n2. Calculate the flour already used by multiplying `BakedBrownies` and `FlourPerBrownie`.\n3.

To continue the game, the remaining players need to calculate the total number of lives they have collectively.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Determine the number of lives per player after three players have quit. Since the lives are shared equally among the remaining players, we can calculate this by dividing the total lives by the number of remaining players.\n2. Multiply the number of lives per player by the total number of remaining players to find the total lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the total lives based on the number of lives per player and the number of remaining players.

Sam still wants to ensure that those who do attend have a memorable time, so he decides to buy cupcakes for them. He wants each attendee to have exactly two cupcakes. The question is, how many cupcakes should Sam buy?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be approached by first determining the number of attending friends and then calculating twice that number, as each person will receive two cupcakes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this in SWI-Prolog, a clear and concise rule can be defined to calculate the required number of cupcakes based on the number of attending friends.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\nKatie prepared 18 cupcakes for a bake sale, but her brother Todd's appetite led him to consume 8 of them. Now, Katie plans to distribute the remaining cupcakes into packages, each containing two cupcakes. The question is, how many packages can she make?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be approached by first calculating the number of cupcakes remaining after Todd's indulgent snack. Then, we can determine how many packages Katie can make by dividing the remaining cupcakes by the capacity of two cupcakes per package.\n\n### Plan:\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, the following strategy can be implemented:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_cupcakes(TotalCupcakes, EatenCupcakes, Remaining)` that calculates how many cupcakes are left after some have been eaten.\n2. Define a predicate `number_of_packages(RemainingCupcakes, PackageCapacity, NumberOfPackages)` to determine the number of packages needed based on the remaining cupcakes and the capacity of each package.\n3. Apply these predicates using the given values of 18 total cupcakes and 8 eaten cupcakes.\n4.

Determine the number of files remaining after deletions. Megan started with 93 files and deleted 21, leaving her with 72 files.\n2.

The number of deleted files will be provided as an input, and the predicate will infer the total original files.\n2. Calculate the number of folders needed by dividing the total remaining files by the desired number of files per folder.

        "question": "Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily has a gardening project involving a big garden and several small gardens. She starts with a fixed number of seeds and follows a specific planting pattern. She plants a bulk of the seeds in the big garden and distributes the remaining seeds across the small gardens, with each small garden receiving an equal number of seeds. The task is to determine how many small gardens Emily has based on the given information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to ascertain the number of seeds remaining after planting in the big garden and then divide these remaining seeds evenly among the small gardens.\n\n1. Find the number of seeds planted in the big garden: Emily plants 29 seeds in the big garden.\n2. Calculate the number of seeds remaining: Emily starts with 41 seeds, so the remaining seeds are found by subtracting the number planted in the big garden: 41 - 29 = 12 seeds.\n3. Divide the remaining seeds among the small gardens: Each small garden receives 4 seeds, so the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining 12 seeds by 4.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this scenario using SWI-Prolog by defining a logical rule that calculates the number of small gardens based on the given input parameters. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `emily_gardens` that takes the total number of seeds (`TotalSeeds`), the number of seeds planted in the big garden (`BigGardenSeeds`), and the number of seeds planted in each small garden (`SmallGardenSeeds`) as parameters.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining seeds after planting in the big garden by subtracting `BigGardenSeeds` from `TotalSeeds`.\n3. Divide the number of remaining seeds by `SmallGardenSeeds` to find the number of small gardens. Use integer division to ensure the result is a whole number.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query system to find the solution by providing the specific values from the problem statement.\n\nThe following is the Prolog code that embodies this plan:\n\n```prolog\nemily_gardens(TotalSeeds, BigGardenSeeds, SmallGardenSeeds, NumSmallGardens) :-\n    RemainingSeeds is TotalSeeds - BigGardenSeeds,\n    NumSmallGardens is RemainingSeeds // SmallGardenSeeds.\n\n% Query to solve Emily's garden mystery\n?- emily_gardens(41, 29, 4, NumSmallGardens).\n```\n\nThis code leverages Prolog's mathematical operations and logical reasoning to deduce the number of small gardens Emily has created.

The task involves calculating how many $2 games Edward can buy with the money he has left.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the remaining money after Edward's expense and then calculate how many $2 increments can be made from that amount.\n\n1. Calculate the money left after Edward's purchase:\n   - Remaining money = Earned money - Money spent on new blades\n   - Remaining money = $37 - $21 = $16\n\n2.

The remaining puppies need to be distributed across cages, each designed to hold up to 8 puppies comfortably. The task is to determine how many cages are required to house the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of cages needed, we must first determine the number of remaining puppies after the sales. Then, we can calculate the number of cages required to accommodate them.\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining puppies: Subtract the sold puppies from the initial stock.\n2. Determine the number of cages needed: Divide the number of remaining puppies by the capacity of each cage, ensuring that the result is rounded up to account for the use of whole cages.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll create a Prolog code that follows this logical structure:\n\n1. Define a rule named `puppy_cages` that takes the number of puppies sold (`SoldPuppies`) and the capacity of each cage (`CageCapacity`) as input parameters and calculates the number of cages required for the remaining puppies.\n2. Inside the rule, calculate the number of remaining puppies by subtracting the sold puppies from the initial count (81).\n3.

His goal is to split these remaining clothes into five equal small loads. We need to determine how many pieces of clothing can be included in each of these small loads.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by calculating the number of pieces remaining and then dividing them equally among the small loads.\n\n1. Number of pieces remaining after the first load: `Remaining Pieces = 39 - 19 = 20 pieces`.\n2. Dividing the remaining pieces into five equal loads: `Pieces per Load = Remaining Pieces / Number of Small Loads = 20 / 5`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of pieces per small load.

Mike can fit 9 books on a single shelf. The task involves calculating the number of shelves needed to accommodate the remaining books after a librarian has taken some of them.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps to solve it:\n\n1. Determine the number of books Mike has after the librarian takes some away. If there are initially 82 books and the librarian takes 10, then Mike has 82 - 10 = 72 books left.\n\n2. Calculate the number of complete shelves needed to hold all the books. We can do this by dividing the number of books by the capacity of each shelf (number of books per shelf): Number of Shelves = 72 / 9.\n\n3. Check if the result from step 2 is a whole number. Since we're dealing with whole numbers of shelves, we need to ensure the calculation doesn't result in a fraction.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of shelves required based on the given parameters. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the code structure:\n\n1. Define a predicate `number_of_shelves(TotalBooks, RemainingBooks, Shelves)` where:\n   - `TotalBooks` is the total number of books Mike has initially.\n   - `RemainingBooks` is the number of books left after the librarian takes some away.\n   - `Shelves` is the number of shelves required.\n\n2. In the body of the rule, calculate `RemainingBooks` by subtracting the books taken by the librarian from the `TotalBooks`.\n\n3. Compute the number of shelves needed by dividing `RemainingBooks` by 9 (books per shelf). Ensure that the division is integer division to get the whole number of shelves required.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and integer division (`//`) to perform the calculations and derive the final answer.\n\nHere's the sample Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of shelves\nnumber_of_shelves(total, remaining, shelves) :-\n    Remaining is total - 10,\n    Shelves is remaining // 9.\n\n% Query to find the number of shelves needed for the initial 82 books\nfind_shelves(Shelves) :-\n    number_of_shelves(82, Shelves).\n```\n\nWith this setup, querying `find_shelves(X)` will return the number of shelves Mike needs to put away the remaining books.

The task is to calculate how many such toys Will can purchase.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to perform the following steps to solve this problem:\n\n1.

Bianca planted a bulk of these seeds in her big garden, leaving her with a remainder that she used to plant in her small gardens, placing two seeds in each garden. We need to calculate how many small gardens Bianca has.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Divide the `RemainingSeeds` by 2, as each small garden gets two seeds. This can be done using integer division (`//`) in Prolog.\n\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA waiter who initially had 21 customers in his section experienced a dropout of 12 customers. The remaining customers are spread across multiple tables, with each table accommodating 3 people. The task is to determine the total number of tables the waiter has in his section after the customer dropout.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of tables, we need to calculate the remainder of customers after 12 have left and then divide this number by 3, as each table seats 3 people.\n\n1. Remaining customers after dropout = 21 initial customers - 12 who left = 9 customers.\n2. Number of tables = Remaining customers / Customers per table = 9 / 3 = 3 tables.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of tables based on the initial number of customers and the number of customers who left.

Then, we create a more specific predicate `waiter_tables` that fixes the number of customers who left to 12, making it easier to query for the specific scenario we're interested in.

Ten of these pictures go into one album, while the remaining 15 are distributed across five different albums. The task is to determine the number of pictures in each album.\n\n### Analysis:\nWe need to distribute the remaining 15 pictures evenly among the five albums, which will give us the count of pictures in each album.\n\n### Plan:\nWe can accomplish this in SWI-Prolog by setting up calculations that find the number of pictures remaining after the first album and then dividing this number by the number of remaining albums to get the pictures per album.\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMike earned $42 from his summer lawn mowing business, but he spent $10 on new mower blades, reducing his earnings. From the remaining money, he wants to buy games that cost $8 each. The task is to calculate how many such games Mike can afford to buy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the money Mike has left after purchasing new mower blades and then divide that amount by the cost of each game.\n\n1. Calculate the money left: Start with Mike's earnings of $42 and subtract the $10 spent on mower blades. This gives the total amount Mike has left.\n\n2. Determine the number of games: Divide the money left by the cost of each game ($8). The result is the maximum number of games Mike can buy.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll use SWI-Prolog to set up a logical rule that computes the number of games Mike can purchase. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a fact for the cost of each game (`GameCost` = $8).\n\n2. Create a rule `money_left(Earnings, RemainingMoney)` that calculates the money Mike has left after purchasing the mower blades. The `Earnings` fact will be instantiated with $42, and the rule will output the `RemainingMoney`.\n\n3. Another rule `number_of_games(RemainingMoney, NumberOfGames, GameCost)` can be defined to calculate the number of games Mike can buy. This rule will take the remaining money and the cost of each game as inputs and output the number of games.\n\n4. Chain the two rules together to compute the answer.\n\nThe corresponding SWI-Prolog code could be:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost of each game\ngame_cost(8). \n\n% Calculate money left after purchasing mower blades\nmoney_left(Earnings, RemainingMoney) :-\n    RemainingMoney is Earnings - 10. % Assuming earnings is $42\n\n% Calculate the number of games Mike can buy\nnumber_of_games(RemainingMoney, NumberOfGames, GameCost) :-\n    NumberOfGames is RemainingMoney // GameCost.\n\n% Compute the answer by chaining the rules\nremaining_games(NumberOfGames) :-\n    money_left(42, RemainingMoney),\n    number_of_games(RemainingMoney, NumberOfGames, 8).\n```\n\nThis code uses simple arithmetic operations and rule instantiation to logically deduce the answer.\n\nNow, executing the query will reveal the correct answer.",

After completing 47 of them, she still has 6 pages worth of problems remaining, with each page presumably containing a fixed number of problems. The task is to determine how many problems are present on each page.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of problems per page, we can use the total number of remaining problems and the number of pages. The problems remaining after Nancy's initial progress are calculated by subtracting the completed problems from the total. Then, dividing the remaining problems by the number of pages will yield the count of problems per page.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the problems per page. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `problems_per_page(TotalProblems, CompletedProblems, Pages, ProblemsPerPage)` that takes the total number of problems, the number of problems completed, and the number of remaining pages and computes the problems per page.\n\n2. Calculate the problems remaining after completion of some problems by Nancy: `RemainingProblems is TotalProblems - CompletedProblems`.\n\n3. Divide the number of remaining problems by the number of pages to find the count of problems per page: `ProblemsPerPage is RemainingProblems / Pages`.\n\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWendy has picked a total of 45 flowers to create bouquets for her friend's wedding. Unfortunately, some of the flowers wilted before the wedding, reducing the available number of fresh flowers. The task is to determine how many bouquets Wendy can still make with the flowers that are in good condition.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by first determining the number of flowers that have wilted and then calculating the remaining flowers that can be used to make bouquets.\n\n1. **Wilted Flowers**: 35 flowers have wilted, leaving the remaining flowers intact.\n2. **Available Flowers**: Subtracting the wilted flowers from the total picked gives us the number of flowers Wendy can still use: 45 total flowers - 35 wilted flowers = 10 flowers.\n3. **Bouquets**: The number of bouquets depends on the count of available flowers, with each bouquet requiring five flowers.\n   - Number of bouquets = Total available flowers / Flowers per bouquet\n   - Number of bouquets = 10 / 5 = 2 bouquets.\n\n### Plan: SWI-Prolog Code Structure:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of bouquets Wendy can make based on the given scenario.

The task is to determine how many shelves were used to display these coloring books.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of shelves used, we need to determine how many books were left after the sale and then calculate the most efficient way to organize them on the shelves.\n\n1. **Books Remaining**: After the sale, 27 initial books minus 6 sold books equal 21 remaining books.\n\n2. **Shelving the Remaining Books**: To maximize efficiency, the store likely shelved the remaining books in a way that filled each shelf equally.\n   - 21 books \u00f7 7 books per shelf = 3 shelves\n\n### Plan: SWI-Prolog Code Structure:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of shelves needed based on the given parameters.

Deletions: Wendy deleted 37 files, leaving her with 82 - 37 = 45 files for organization.\n2. Folders: The remaining 45 files need to be divided into groups of five, with any remainder accounting for the last folder.\n   - Number of folders containing 5 files each = 45 / 5\n   - If the division is not exact, we must account for the remainder.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of folders based on the number of remaining files after deletions.

She starts with a fixed number of seeds and follows a specific planting pattern. The question is to determine how many small gardens Sarah has based on the number of seeds and their distribution.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find Sarah's total count of small gardens, we need to ascertain the number of seeds attributed to the small gardens. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The big garden receives 12 seeds, leaving 21 - 12 = 9 seeds for the small gardens.\n2. Each small garden contains 3 seeds, and we need to find how many gardens 9 seeds can make.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMike earned a total of $69 by mowing lawns during the summer. He spent $24 on new mower blades, leaving him with the remaining amount of money to spend. The task is to determine how many $5 games he can buy with the money he has left.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many $5 games Mike can purchase, we need to calculate the money he has available after the expense and then divide this amount by $5, as each game costs $5.\n\n1. Calculate Mike's remaining money: Start with his total earnings of $69 and subtract the $24 spent on mower blades.\n2. Divide the remaining money by $5 to find the maximum number of $5 games Mike can buy.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a logical rule that computes the number of games Mike can buy. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_games` that takes Mike's total earnings (`Earnings`) and the cost of the mower blades (`BladeCost`) as input.\n2. Calculate the money Mike has left by subtracting the `BladeCost` from the `Earnings`.\n3. Divide this remaining amount by $5 to find the number of $5 games he can buy. We'll use integer division to get the whole number of games.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to construct this rule.\n5.

        "question": "The cafeteria had 75 apples. For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\nWe are given the initial count of apples available in the cafeteria, which is 75. After some apples were handed out to students (19 apples), we need to determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples, considering each pie requires 8 apples for its preparation.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo find out how many pies can be made, the remaining apples after the student lunch must be calculated first. Then, this number should be divided by the number of apples needed for one pie. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining apples by subtracting the handed out apples from the initial count: `RemainingApples = InitialApples - HandedOutApples`.\n2. Determine the number of pies that can be made by dividing the RemainingApples by the number of apples per pie: `NumberofPies = RemainingApples / ApplesPerPie`.\n\n### Plan:\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of pies based on the given inputs of initial apples and apples used per pie. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `number_of_pies(InitialApples, HandedOutApples, ApplesPerPie, NumberOfPies)` that computes the number of pies by using the remaining apples after lunch.\n2. Calculate the RemainingApples using the difference between InitialApples and HandedOutApples.\n3. Divide the RemainingApples by ApplesPerPie to get the NumberOfPies.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and variable unification to execute these calculations.\n\nThe following is a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this strategy:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of pies\nnumber_of_pies(InitialApples, HandedOutApples, ApplesPerPie, NumberOfPies) :-\n    RemainingApples is InitialApples - HandedOutApples,\n    NumberOfPies is ceil(RemainingApples / ApplesPerPie).\n\n% Query the rule with the given values to find the number of pies\nfind_pies(NumberOfPies) :-\n    number_of_pies(75, 19, 8, NumberOfPies).\n```\n\nThis code uses the defined logical relationships to calculate the remaining apples after lunch and then determines how many pies can be made, ensuring an accurate answer even when the remaining apples aren't a perfect multiple of the apples needed per pie.",

        "question": "Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSarah has baked 38 cupcakes for a bake sale, but her brother Todd ends up eating 14 of them. Now Sarah needs to repackage the remaining cupcakes into packages of 8. The task is to determine how many packages Sarah can make under these circumstances.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many packages Sarah can create, we need to calculate the number of remaining cupcakes and then divide this number by the cupcakes per package.\n\n1. Find the number of cupcakes left: Subtract the number of cupcakes eaten by Todd from the total baked.\n2. Divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the cupcakes per package to get the number of packages.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that computes the number of packages based on the given input of the total cupcakes baked and the cupcakes consumed by Todd. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a rule called `cupcake_packages` that accepts two variables: `total_cupcakes`, the total number of cupcakes baked, and `eaten_cupcakes`, the number of cupcakes Todd ate.\n2. Calculate the remaining cupcakes by subtracting `eaten_cupcakes` from `total_cupcakes`.\n3. Divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the desired `cupcakes_per_package` to determine the number of packages.\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and its ability to solve for the number of packages.\n\nThe following is a suggested Prolog code snippet based on this strategy:\n\n```prolog\ncupcake_packages(Total, Eaten, Remaining, Packages) :-\n    Remaining is Total - Eaten,\n    Packages is Remaining // 8.\n\nsarahs_packages(TotalBaked, ToddEaten, Packages) :-\n    cupcake_packages(TotalBaked, ToddEaten, 8, Packages).\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define a general predicate `cupcake_packages` that calculates the number of packages for different scenarios and then create a more specific predicate `sarahs_packages` tailored to Sarah's situation. This approach leverages Prolog's flexibility in defining relationships and performing calculations to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNancy has uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook and organized them into albums. She placed 37 pictures in one album and divided the remaining pictures evenly between two different albums. The task is to determine the number of pictures in each album.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of pictures in each album, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining pictures after placing 37 in one album. This is done by subtracting 37 from the total of 41 pictures.\n2. Divide the number of remaining pictures by 2, as they are placed in two different albums.\n3. Add the number of pictures from step 2 to the known number of pictures in the first album (37) to find the number of pictures in each of the two different albums.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of pictures in each album using the given information. The plan involves using basic arithmetic operations and variable relationships.\n\n1. Define a rule named `picture_distribution` that takes the total number of pictures (`TotalPics`) as an input and calculates the number of pictures in each album.\n2. Subtract the number of pictures in the first album (37) from the total to find the remaining pictures.\n3. Divide the remaining pictures by 2 to find the number of pictures in each of the other two albums.\n4. Add this number to the number of pictures in the first album to get the final answer.\n5.
