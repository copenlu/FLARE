                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given the cost of items Sara purchased: a pair of shoes and a dress. Sara's total expenditure is the sum of these two items. Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on similar items. Thus, to find out how much Rachel should budget, we need to calculate Sara's total expenditure and then double that amount to find Rachel's budget.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate Sara's total expenditure by adding the cost of the shoes and the dress.\n2. Double Sara's expenditure to determine Rachel's budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of Rachel's budget based on the expenses of Sara. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent)` which calculates the total amount spent by Sara. This rule will take the cost of the shoes and the dress as input and output the total spent.\n   \n2. Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget. This rule will take the total spent by Sara as input and output the budget for Rachel by doubling Sara's expenditure.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (ShoesCost as $50 and DressCost as $200) and use them to compute the desired budget for Rachel.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `RachelBudget` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define how much Sara spent\ntotal_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent) :-\n    TotalSpent is ShoesCost + DressCost.\n\n% Define Rachel's budget as twice what Sara spent\nbudget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget) :-\n    RachelBudget is 2 * SaraSpent.\n\n% Sample query to find Rachel's budget\n% ?- total_spent_by_sara(50, 200, SaraSpent), budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total spent by Sara and then calculates Rachel's budget based on Sara's expenditure. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given costs of the shoes and dress, outputting the amount Rachel should budget."

Each video game costs $45, and each book costs $5. By the end of the summer, Kenny has mowed 35 lawns and wants to buy 5 video games. We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently."

Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_apples(Total)` which calculates the total number of apples ordered. This predicate will output the total count of apples.\n\n2. Define a predicate `students_wanted(Wanted)` which represents the number of students who wanted fruit.\n\n3. Calculate the number of apples needed for the students using another predicate `apples_needed(Wanted, Needed)`, where `Needed` is the total number of apples the students wanted.\n\n4. Subtract the apples needed from the total apples ordered to find the extra apples using a predicate `extra_apples(Total, Needed, Leftover)`.\n\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find the number of extra apples by instantiating the predicates with the given values (42 red and 7 green apples, and 9 students wanting fruit).\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code might look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of apples\ntotal_apples(89).\n\n% Number of students wanting fruit\nstudents_wanted(9).\n\n% Calculate apples needed for students\napples_needed(Wanted, Needed) :-\n    Needed is Wanted * 2.  % Assuming each student wanted 2 apples\n\n% Find extra apples\nextra_apples(Total, Needed, Leftover) :-\n    Leftover is Total - Needed.\n\n% Query to find the extra apples\nquery(Extra) :- extra_apples(89, X, Extra).\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define the total number of apples and the number of students who want fruit. We then calculate the number of apples the students needed, assuming each student wanted 2 apples. Finally, we determine the number of extra apples by subtracting the needed apples from the total. The query at the end retrieves the correct answer using the defined predicates.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWendy prepared pastries for a bake sale, including cupcakes and cookies. She baked 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies initially, but after the sale, she had 24 pastries left. We need to determine how many pastries she sold during the bake sale.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into a simple arithmetic calculation. The number of pastries sold is the difference between the initial number of pastries and the number of pastries left unsold.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code can be constructed to perform this simple calculation using the difference operator. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define the initial number of pastries, which includes the 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies.\n2. Define the number of pastries left unsold after the bake sale.\n3. Subtract the unsold pastries from the initial number to calculate the number of pastries sold.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this scenario might look like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_pastries(Total) :- Total = 4 + 29.\npastries_left(Left) :- Left = 24.\n\npastries_sold(Sold) :-\n    initial_pastries(Total),\n    pastries_left(Left),\n    Sold is Total - Left.\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define the total initial pastries and then the number left after the sale. The actual number of pastries sold is computed by finding the difference between these two values. We can then query this predicate to obtain the correct answer.

        "question": "At the arcade, Tom won 32 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 25 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he spent 7 of his tickets on a hat, how many tickets does Tom have left?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTom has won a total of 32 tickets from playing 'whack a mole' and another 25 tickets from playing 'skee ball' at the arcade. After spending 7 tickets on a hat, Tom's remaining tickets need to be calculated.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find Tom's remaining tickets, follow these steps:\n\n1. Add the number of tickets Tom won from both games to get the total tickets: \n   - Total Tickets = 32 (whack a mole) + 25 (skee ball) = 57 tickets\n\n2. Subtract the number of tickets Tom spent on the hat from the total tickets:\n   - Remaining Tickets = Total Tickets - Tickets Spent on Hat = 57 - 7 = 50 tickets\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe plan for writing the SWI-Prolog code involves setting up a logical relationship between the total tickets and the remaining tickets after spending some on a hat. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `remaining_tickets` that takes the total number of tickets as an input and computes the remaining tickets after spending 7 tickets.\n2. Subtract the number of tickets spent on the hat from the total tickets to find the remaining tickets.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform the subtraction.\n\nThe code structure based on this strategy will look like:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate remaining tickets\nremaining_tickets(TotalTickets, RemainingTickets) :-\n    RemainingTickets is TotalTickets - 7.\n```\n\nThis simple rule captures the logic of subtracting the cost of the hat from the total number of tickets.

The store's inventory changed, and they now have a different number of cats remaining. We need to determine how many cats they have left after the sale.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves subtracting the number of cats sold from the initial count to find the number of cats left unsold.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this in SWI-Prolog by creating a rule that takes the initial number of Siamese and house cats and the number of cats sold as inputs and returns the number of cats left in the store.

We need to determine the number of students who didn't make the cut after the initial tryouts.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a waiter initially had 47 customers and then experienced a change in the number of customers under his care. He lost some customers but gained others. The task is to determine the final number of customers the waiter would have after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Customers**: The waiter began with 47 customers.\n2. **Customers Left**: 41 customers left, resulting in a reduction to the number of customers being served.\n3. **New Customers**: The waiter gained 20 new customers after some left.\n4. **Final Count**: To find the final number of customers, we must subtract the customers who left from the initial count and then add the new customers to this result.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this scenario using SWI-Prolog by defining relationships that mimic the logical steps outlined above. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Define a fact for the initial number of customers.\n   - `initial_customers(47)`\n\n2. **Customers Left**: Define a rule to simulate the departure of 41 customers.\n   - `customers_left(RemainingCustomers)`\n\n3. **New Customers**: Add new customers by defining another rule.\n   - `new_customers(RemainingCustomers, FinalCustomers)` \n\n4. **Final Calculation**: Use the rules established above to compute the final number of customers using SWI-Prolog's inference capabilities.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured based on these relationships to calculate the answer.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n```prolog\n% 1.

The difference between the number of books post addition and the books sold prior to that will give us the answer.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Books in Bin**: There are 4 books initially placed in the bargain bin.\n\n2. **Books Sold**: 3 books are sold from the bin, reducing the number of books to 1.\n\n3. **Books Added**: 10 books are then added to the bin, increasing the number of books.\n\n4. **Final Count**: To find the total number of books remaining in the bin after the sale and addition.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will break down the problem into smaller components and then use SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a fact for the initial number of books: `initial_books(4)`.\n\n2. Define a rule to calculate the number of books sold using a variable: `books_sold(Sold)`.\n\n3. Introduce another rule to add new books using another variable: `books_added(Added)`.\n\n4. The final number of books in the bin can be calculated by adding the books remaining after the sale (initial books minus sold books) and the books added later.\n\n5. Using SWI-Prolog's querying capabilities, we can determine the answer by instantiating the variables appropriately.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would be structured as:\n\n```prolog\n% 1. Initial books in the bin\ninitial_books(4).\n\n% 2. Books sold\nbooks_sold(Sold).\n\n% 3. Books added after the sale\nbooks_added(Added).\n\n% 4. Calculate the final number of books\nfinal_books(Final) :-\n    Remaining is initial_books - Sold,\n    Final is Remaining + Added.\n\n% Query to get the answer\n?- books_sold(3), books_added(10), final_books(Answer), write(Answer).\n```\n\nWe can then input the values of the sold books and added books to obtain the final number of books in the bin.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nCody started with a certain number of tickets won at the arcade, spent some of them on a beanie, and then won additional tickets. The task is to determine how many tickets Cody has in total after these transactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Tickets**: Cody began with 49 tickets.\n2. **Tickets Spent**: He spent 25 tickets on a beanie, leaving him with half of the initial tickets.\n   - Remaining tickets after spending = 1/2 * 49 = 24.5 tickets (since we cannot have half a ticket)\n\n3. **Additional Tickets Won**: Cody then won 6 more tickets, which we can simply add to the remaining tickets after the expenditure.\n   - Total tickets after winning = 24.5 + 6 = 30.5 tickets\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a clear and structured approach to solve this problem. Our plan involves breaking down the problem into logical steps and using arithmetic operations to calculate the final answer.\n\n1. **Define the Initial Situation**: Start by setting a fact that represents Cody's initial win of 49 tickets.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Tickets**: Use a rule that subtracts the cost of the beanie (25 tickets) from the initial amount, rounding down to the nearest whole number.\n3. **Add Additional Tickets**: Add a simple rule to increase the remaining tickets by 6, representing the further tickets Cody won.\n4. **Display Final Answer**: Define a rule that displays the total number of tickets Cody has after these transactions.\n\nWe can use Prolog's built-in arithmetic capabilities throughout this process to perform the necessary calculations.

He decided to downsize his library by selling a portion of these books and using the earned money to purchase new titles. The question is to determine how many books Adam would have after this process of selling and buying.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Books**: Adam starts with a collection of 33 books.\n\n2. **Books Sold**: He sells a number of books, say 'x', and earns money based on the value of these books. We know the value of 'x' is 11.\n\n3. **Money Used for Buying Books**: The money earned from selling the books is then used to buy new books. The number of new books purchased, say 'y', depends on the price of each book. We'll need to factor in the total amount of money spent.\n\n4. **Final Count**: To find the total number of books Adam eventually has, we must subtract the books sold ('x') from the initial count (33) and then add the books purchased ('y').\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will outline a step-by-step approach to solving this problem using SWI-Prolog code.\n\n1. **Define Facts**:\n   - `initial_books(33)` to represent Adam's initial book collection.\n   - `books_sold(11)` to define the number of books Adam sold.\n\n2. **Calculate Books Purchased**:\n   - Use a rule to calculate the total money earned by selling the books.

After this purge, he goes on a shopping spree to restock his sock drawer. The question is: how many socks will George have after this process of removal and addition?\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. George initially has 28 socks.\n2. He throws away 4 old socks, reducing the count to 24.\n3. Following this, he purchases 36 new socks.\n4. To find the final count, we need to add these new socks to the remaining 24.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a clear and structured approach to solve this problem.

Define the throwaway operation, which subtracts 4 socks, using a rule named `remove_old_socks/2`.\n3. Define the addition of new socks by multiplying the number of new socks by a constant, using a rule named `add_new_socks/2`.\n4. Use Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform these calculations.\n5.

Ensure the code is well-structured, and each step of the solution is represented by a predicate. Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities where necessary.

        "question": "At the arcade Victor won 46 tickets. If he spent 27 tickets on a beanie and later won 39 more tickets, how many would he have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVictor currently holds 46 tickets and plans to use some of them to purchase a beanie. After this purchase, he continues his gaming and wins more tickets, aiming to accumulate as many as possible. The task involves calculating the total number of tickets Victor has after spending some on the beanie and winning additional ones.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Tickets**: Victor starts with 46 tickets.\n\n2. **Tickets Spent on Beanie**: He spends a substantial amount, leaving him with a reduced count. We need to subtract the cost of the beanie from his initial tickets.\n\n3. **Additional Tickets Won**: Victor continues playing and wins more tickets, adding to his remaining count. We should add the newly won tickets to the remaining initial tickets after the purchase.\n\n4. **Total Tickets**: The final step is to compute the total number of tickets Victor has in hand.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to formulate a code that computes Victor's final ticket count. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_tickets/1` to represent the tickets Victor starts with (46 tickets).\n   - `tickets_spent/2` for the number of tickets spent on the beanie.\n   - `additional_won_tickets/1` for the tickets Victor won after the purchase.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Compute the remaining tickets after spending on the beanie: `RemainingInitialTickets` = `initial_tickets` - `tickets_spent`.\n   - Add the newly won tickets to the remaining initial tickets: `TotalTickets` = `remaining_initial_tickets` + `additional_won_tickets`.\n\n3. **Write the Query**: Use the defined predicates and relationships to write a query that computes Victor's final ticket tally.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define Victor's initial tickets\ninitial_tickets(46).\n\n% Compute remaining tickets after spending on beanie\ntickets_spent(BeanieCost, RemainingTickets) :-\n    RemainingTickets is initial_tickets - BeanieCost.\n\n% Add newly won tickets to the remaining initial tickets\ntotal_tickets(RemainingTickets, NewTickets, Total) :-\n    Total is RemainingTickets + NewTickets.\n\n% Query to compute the final total of tickets\n?- tickets_spent(27, Remaining), total_tickets(Remaining, 39, Total).\n```\n\nFollowing this plan, we can use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and relational logic to guide the computation, ultimately finding Victor's total ticket count after the beanie purchase and additional winnings.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nChloe's carrot harvesting involves multiple steps: first, she picks 48 carrots, then throws out a significant portion (45 of them), and finally, picks an additional 42 carrots the next day. To find the total number of carrots she has after these iterations, we need to calculate the remaining carrots after the discard and then add the new ones picked.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Picking**: Chloe starts with 48 carrots.\n\n2. **Discarding Carrots**: She throws away 45 carrots, leaving only 3 left from the initial picking.\n\n3. **Subsequent Picking**: The next day, Chloe picks another 42 carrots.\n\n4. **Total Calculation**: To find the overall total, we must sum the carrots retained after the discard and the new carrots picked.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will create a SWI-Prolog code to automate the calculation of Chloe's final carrot count. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a fact for the initial number of carrots picked, `initial_pick(NumCarrots)`, where NumCarrots is set to 48.\n\n2. Define a rule, `after_discard(RemainingCarrots)`, to calculate how many carrots Chloe has left after discarding 45. This can be done by subtracting the discarded carrots from the initial pick.\n\n3. Define another rule, `final_pick(NewCarrots)`, which represents the carrots picked the next day. Set NewCarrots to 42, as mentioned in the problem.\n\n4. Use a rule, `total_carrots(FinalTotal)`, to calculate the sum of the remaining and newly picked carrots, thereby finding the overall total.\n\n5.

        "question": "Bianca had 34 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 14 old songs from it and then added 44 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca's MP3 player initially had 34 songs, but she decided to delete some old songs, creating some space for new additions. She removed 14 songs, bringing the count down to 20. Subsequently, she added 44 new songs, and now the question is to determine the total number of songs on her MP3 player after these deletions and additions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into a series of logical steps:\n\n1. Deletion of old songs: Subtract 14 songs from the initial 34 to get the number of remaining songs, resulting in 20 songs (34 - 14 = 20).\n2. Addition of new songs: Add the 44 new songs to the 20 songs that are left after the deletion, resulting in a total of 64 songs (20 + 44 = 64).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that mimics the song addition and deletion process, starting with the initial 34 songs. The plan involves using basic arithmetic operations and logical relationships to guide the Prolog program. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `song_count(InitialSongs, DeletedSongs, AddedSongs, FinalSongs)` that represents the song deletion and addition process.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the intermediate step where songs are deleted: `FinalSongs is InitialSongs - DeletedSongs`.\n3. Perform the second arithmetic operation to find the final count after adding new songs: `FinalSongs is FinalSongs + AddedSongs`.\n4. Provide the actual values of the initial songs (34), deleted songs (14), and added songs (44) for testing.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code:\n\n1. Initialize the initial song count with a fact: `initial_songs(34)`.\n2. Define the deletion process by subtracting the deleted songs from the initial count: `deleted_songs(DeletedSongs, RemainingSongs)` where `RemainingSongs is InitialSongs - DeletedSongs`.\n3. Define the addition process by adding the added songs to the remaining songs after deletion: `added_songs(AddedSongs, FinalSongs)` where `FinalSongs is RemainingSongs + AddedSongs`.\n4. Combine the predicates using logical relationships to form the complete solution.\n\nThe following SWI-Prolog code realizes the above plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Initialize the initial song count\ninitial_songs(34).\n\n% Delete old songs\ndeleted_songs(14, 20). % 20 songs remaining after deletion\n\n% Add new songs\nadded_songs(44, 64).  % Final count after addition\n\n% Logical relationship between the predicates to solve the problem\nsong_count(InitialSongs, DeletedSongs, AddedSongs, FinalSongs) :-\n    initial_songs(InitialSongs),\n    deleted_songs(DeletedSongs, RemainingSongs),\n    added_songs(AddedSongs, FinalSongs),\n    FinalSongs is InitialSongs - DeletedSongs + AddedSongs.\n\n% Query to find the final number of songs\nfind_final_song_count(FinalSongs) :-\n    song_count(34, 14, 44, FinalSongs).\n```\n\nNow, running the query `find_final_song_count(X)` will yield the correct final count of songs on Bianca's MP3 player.",

This plan involves setting up the logical relationships and utilizing Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_cupcakes(RemainingCupcakes, TotalCupcakes)` where:\n   - `RemainingCupcakes` represents the number of cupcakes Maria has left after selling 5 cupcakes from the first batch.\n   - `TotalCupcakes` is the total number of cupcakes Maria has after the second baking session.\n2. Calculate the total number of cupcakes by summing the remaining cupcakes from the first batch and the newly baked cupcakes from the second batch.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThis problem revolves around changes in the student population in the fourth grade throughout the school year. We start with a certain number of students, then some students leave, and others join. We need to determine the final count of students in the fourth grade at the end of the year.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Represent the initial number of students as a variable, `InitialStudents`.\n2. Subtract the number of students who left, `LeftStudents`, from the initial count to find the number of students remaining after the departures.\n3. Add the number of new students, `NewStudents`, to the remaining students from step 2 to calculate the final student population.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that computes the final student count based on the provided variables. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `final_students(InitialStudents, LeftStudents, NewStudents, FinalStudents)` where:\n   - `InitialStudents` is the number of students at the beginning of the year.\n   - `LeftStudents` is the number of students who left.\n   - `NewStudents` is the number of new students who joined.\n   - `FinalStudents` is the final count of students after the additions and subtractions.\n\n2. Use basic arithmetic operations to perform the additions and subtractions for computing the final student count.\n\nHere's the step-by-step construction of the Prolog code:\n\n1.

Define the predicate `final_students` to compute the final count:\n```prolog\nfinal_students(InitialStudents, LeftStudents, NewStudents, FinalStudents) :-\n    RemainingStudents is InitialStudents - LeftStudents,\n    FinalStudents is RemainingStudents + NewStudents.\n```\n\n3.

        "question": "Debby had 30 coloring books. If she gave away 7 of them, but then bought 35 more, how many would she have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDebby initially had 30 coloring books. She engaged in a series of transactions, first giving away 7 books and then purchasing 35 more. The end result is an increase in her collection, and we need to calculate the total number of coloring books she has after these transactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe must consider each transaction Debby made to determine the total number of coloring books.\n\n1. **Initial Books**: Debby started with 30 coloring books.\n2. **Books Given Away**: Debby then gave away 7 books, reducing her collection to 30 - 7 = 23 books.\n3. **Books Purchased**: After the giveaway, Debby purchased 35 new books, which added to her collection. The sum of the remaining books and the new books is 23 + 35 = 58 books.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this simple calculation in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that takes into account the number of initial books and the number of books given away, and then uses arithmetic operations to calculate the total number of books.\n\n1. **Define the Rule**: Create a rule named `total_books` that takes two parameters: the number of initial books (`InitialBooks`) and the number of books given away (`GivenAway`).\n2. **Calculate the Total**: Subtract the books given away from the initial books to find the number of remaining books after the giveaway.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWe are considering a scenario where the school cafeteria starts with a certain number of apples and then engages in a couple of transactions. First, they use 8 apples to prepare lunch, which reduces the available quantity. After this, they restock by buying a known number of apples. The task is to determine the total number of apples the cafeteria has in stock after this second transaction.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to simulate the two transactions described in the problem:\n\n1. **Lunch Preparation**: Reduce the initial stock of 12 apples by 8 to represent using them for lunch. This leaves us with 4 apples.\n\n2. **Purchasing**: Add the number of apples bought (19) to the remaining 4 apples after the first transaction.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will create a Prolog code snippet that follows these steps:\n\n1. Define a fact for the initial number of apples (`InitialApples` = 12).\n2. Create a rule to simulate the first transaction, reducing the number of apples by 8 (`ReduceApples`).\n3. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the number of apples remaining after the lunch preparation (`RemainingApples`).\n4. Create another rule to simulate the purchasing transaction by adding the number of bought apples to the remaining apples (`AddPurchasedApples`).\n5. Compute the final count of apples using simple arithmetic.\n6. Use Prolog's query mechanism to input the problem details and obtain the solution.\n\n### Prolog Code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the initial number of apples\ninitial_apples(12).\n\n% Reduce the number of apples by 8 for lunch\nreduce_apples(Remaining) :-\n    InitialApples = 12,\n    Remaining is InitialApples - 8.\n\n% Calculate the number of apples after lunch preparation\napples_after_lunch(RemainingApples) :-\n    reduce_apples(RemainingApples).\n\n% Add the purchased apples to the remaining apples\nadd_purchased_apples(FinalApples, Purchased) :-\n    apples_after_lunch(RemainingApples),\n    FinalApples is RemainingApples + Purchased.\n\n% Query to find the total apples after the purchase\n% ?- add_purchased_apples(TotalApples, 19).\n```\n\nThis code walks through the scenario, step by step, allowing us to find the total number of apples in the school cafeteria after the described transactions.

We need to determine the net change in the number of people and find out the final count of people in line.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Subtract the number of people who left from the initial number of people in line to find the intermediate result after the first event.\n2. Add the number of people who joined the line after the first event to this intermediate result.\n3. Find the final count of people in line by adding the results of the above two calculations.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll break down the problem into smaller steps and implement them as predicates in our SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1.

        "question": "Cody bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy and 3 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 8 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nCody has purchased multiple boxes of chocolate and caramel candies, and the task is to determine the total number of candy pieces he now possesses. The key to solving this lies in multiplying the number of boxes by the pieces present in each box.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total amount of candy, the following approach can be taken:\n\n1. Determine the total number of chocolate candy pieces by multiplying the number of boxes (7) by pieces per box (8).\n2. Do the same for the caramel candy boxes: Multiply the number of boxes (3) by pieces per box (8).\n3. Add the totals from both types of candy to find the overall total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe plan for constructing the SWI-Prolog code involves breaking down the problem into logical steps and defining predicates to handle each step. Here's the detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_chocolate_pieces` that takes the number of boxes (`ChocolateBoxes`) and pieces per box (`PiecesPerBox`) as input and returns the total number of chocolate pieces.\n2. Define a predicate `total_caramel_pieces` with a similar input and return value, to calculate the total caramel pieces.\n3. Define another predicate `total_candies` that takes and returns the total number of candies by adding the chocolate and caramel piece totals.\n\n4. Implement these predicates using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations:\n   - For instance, in `total_chocolate_pieces`, we would have: `TotalChocolate is ChocolateBoxes * PiecesPerBox`.\n\n5. Use the predicates in conjunction to find the overall total candy count when provided with the number of boxes of each type.\n\nHere's a sample Prolog code implementing this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate total chocolate pieces\ntotal_chocolate_pieces(ChocolateBoxes, PiecesPerBox, TotalChocolate) :-\n    TotalChocolate is ChocolateBoxes * PiecesPerBox.\n\n% Calculate total caramel pieces\ntotal_caramel_pieces(CaramelBoxes, PiecesPerBox, TotalCaramel) :-\n    TotalCaramel is CaramelBoxes * PiecesPerBox.\n\n% Calculate the overall total candy count\ntotal_candies(ChocolateBoxes, CaramelBoxes, PiecesPerBox, TotalCandy) :-\n    total_chocolate_pieces(ChocolateBoxes, PiecesPerBox, TotalChocolate),\n    total_caramel_pieces(CaramelBoxes, PiecesPerBox, TotalCaramel),\n    TotalCandy is TotalChocolate + TotalCaramel.\n\n% Example query\n?- total_candies(7, 3, 8, TotalCandy).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses a logical and mathematical approach to solve the problem, making it both clear and flexible, allowing for different inputs and potential extensions.",

Each box contains a fixed number of items - specifically, 5 scarves and 5 mittens. The task is to calculate the total number of winter clothing items that Paige has across all these boxes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total count of winter clothing items, we need to multiply the number of scarves and mittens in one box, and then multiply this by the total number of boxes Paige has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe strategy for the SWI-Prolog code is to define a clear relationship between the number of boxes, scarves, and mittens, and then perform the necessary multiplications to find the total count.\n\n1. **Define a Fact**: Represent the number of boxes Paige has as a constant fact.\n\n2. **Items per Box**: Define a predicate that represents the number of scarves and mittens in one box. This will be a single predicate with the total count as the output.\n\n3. **Total Items**: Create a rule that multiplies the number of items in one box by the total number of boxes to find the overall count of winter clothing items.\n\n4. **Display the Result**: Use Prolog's capabilities to display the final answer.\n\nThe main logic is to establish the number of items in one box and then scale it up based on the total number of boxes.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule or fact that represents the cost of a meal. We'll call it `meal_cost(Cost)` with Cost as the number of dollars per meal.\n2. Define another rule `group_size(AdultCount, ChildCount)` to represent the group size, where `AdultCount` is the number of adults and `ChildCount` is the number of children.\n3. Calculate the total number of meals required by summing the meals for adults and children. Assuming each person gets one meal, we can multiply the count of adults and children by a constant meal factor.\n\n4. Compute the total cost by multiplying the total number of meals by the cost per meal.\n5. Use the provided values of 2 adults, 5 children, and a meal costing $8 to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe code will be short and concise, relying on basic Prolog features to perform the calculations. We can use the logical relationships and built-in arithmetic capabilities of SWI-Prolog to solve this problem efficiently.",

Each table has a different number of customers seated, with seven women and two men at each.

We have a single waiter who is attending to multiple tables, and each table has a fixed number of customers. To find the total number of customers, we need to determine the number of customers per table and multiply it by the number of tables.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog's logic and arithmetic capabilities to construct a code that solves the problem.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTiffany's score in the video game is directly related to the number of treasures she finds. Each treasure is worth 6 points, and she completes different levels to collect these treasures. The first level rewards her for finding 3 treasures, while the second level is worth 5 treasures. To determine her total score, we need to calculate the points earned for each level and add them together.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the total score earned by Tiffany across both levels. This can be broken down into two parts: the score for the first level and the score for the second level.\n\n1. **Score for the first level**: The first level mentions 3 treasures, and each treasure is worth 6 points, so the score for the first level is 3 * 6 = 18 points.\n2. **Score for the second level**: Similarly, the second level earns her 5 * 6 = 30 points.\n\nTo find the total score, we simply add the scores of the two levels together.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog's logical reasoning and arithmetic capabilities to implement a solution. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_score(Level, Score)` where `Level` represents the level number and `Score` is the corresponding score earned.\n2. Specify the score earned for each level. The first level earns 18 points (`3 treasures * 6 points/treasure`), and the second level earns 30 points (`5 treasures * 6 points/treasure`).\n3. Define another predicate `total_score(Total)`, where `Total` is the sum of the scores earned in both levels.\n4.

Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform the multiplication and addition of the total time.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan and write the Prolog code based on the provided specifications.\n\n### SWI Prolog Code:\n\n1. First, we define the predicate for the time taken per piece:\n```prolog\ntime_per_piece(4).  % 4 minutes per piece\n```\n\n2. Next, we define the predicate to calculate the total time:\n```prolog\ntotal_time(Chairs, Tables, TotalMinutes) :-\n    TotalMinutes is (Chairs + Tables) * time_per_piece(4).\n```\n\nHere, we use the isomer `is` to perform the arithmetic operation and compute `TotalMinutes`.\n\n3. Now, we can solve the problem by providing the actual values:\n```prolog\ntotal_time(7, 3, Total).\nwrite(Total).\n```\n\nThis code will output the correct total time spent by Rachel on setting up the furniture. The plan's structured nature allows for a straightforward translation into Prolog code, making the problem-solving process efficient and organized.",

With three boxes, each containing three scarves and four mittens, Lana has a reasonable number of winter clothes to organize. Understanding the structure of the problem and the relationship between the boxes and their contents is essential.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo calculate the total number of winter clothing items, the following components need to be considered:\n\n1. The number of boxes.\n2. The number of scarves and mittens in each box.\n\nWe need to multiply the contents of a single box by the total number of boxes to find the overall count.\n\n### Plan:\nThe Prolog code can be structured as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule named `count_winter_clothes` with two parameters: the number of boxes (`NumBoxes`) and the count of scarves and mittens per box (`ClothesPerBox`).\n2. Inside the rule, calculate the number of scarves and mittens by multiplying `ClothesPerBox` with `NumBoxes`.\n3. Add these two counts together to get the total count of winter clothing items.\n4.

To find the total number of winter clothing items, we need to determine the total count of scarves and mittens across all the boxes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem is straightforward and can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Each box contains 2 scarves. The number of boxes is arbitrary and not specified, but since we are told there are 4 boxes, this means a total of 4 * 2 = 8 scarves.\n2. Each box also contains 6 mittens, so the total number of mittens is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by 6, resulting in 4 * 6 = 24 mittens.\n3.

Similarly, the bumper cars also cost 3 tickets per ride, and Oliver rode them 3 times. The total tickets used for the bumper cars are 3 rides * 3 tickets/ride = 9 tickets.\n3.

The total time taken will be directly proportional to the number of furniture pieces she has to assemble. Her goal is to put together 4 chairs and 2 tables, and we need to calculate the total time required for this task.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by simply multiplying the time taken per piece of furniture by the total number of pieces. Since Emily spends 8 minutes on each item, the total time will be calculated as follows:\n\n1. For the chairs: 4 chairs * 8 minutes each = 32 minutes.\n2.

Determine the total number of chicken wings available: 9 initial wings + 7 newly cooked wings = 16 wings.\n2. Divide the total number of wings by the number of friends to find out the equal distribution: 16 wings / 4 friends.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in swi-prolog, we will create a rule that takes the number of friends and the number of chicken wings available and calculates the equal distribution. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named \"equal_distribution\" that takes the NumberOfFriends and TotalChickenWings as input variables.\n2.

Divide the total number of pictures evenly among the three albums.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to write a code that solves this problem. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule, say \"picture_distribution,\" which takes the number of phone pictures and camera pictures as input and returns the number of pictures in each album as the output.\n2. Calculate the total number of pictures by summing the phone and camera pictures.\n3. Use the `//` (integer division) operator to divide the total number of pictures evenly among the three albums.\n4. Return the integer division result as the number of pictures in each album.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code implementing this strategy might look like this:\n\n```prolog\npicture_distribution(PhonePics, CameraPics, PicturesPerAlbum) :-\n    TotalPics is PhonePics + CameraPics,\n    PicturesPerAlbum is TotalPics // 3.\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `is` operator to perform the required calculations and derive the number of pictures in each album. The `//` operator ensures that we obtain a whole number of pictures per album, as division should result in an equal distribution. This Prolog code demonstrates a practical application of logical programming for solving a real-world problem involving data manipulation and mathematical operations.",

Each van has a capacity of 5 people, and the group includes 12 students and 3 adults.

The task is to determine how many trips he will need to make to clear trays from two different tables, one with 17 trays and another with 55 trays.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo find out the number of trips Dave will make, we should calculate how many trays need to be carried in total and then determine how many trips are required based on his capacity.\n\n1. Table 1 has 17 trays.\n2. Table 2 has 55 trays.\n3. The total number of trays is 17 + 55 = 72 trays.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nGeorge has purchased a significant number of sodas for his birthday party: 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. However, his fridge has limited space, allowing only four cans on each shelf. The question is how many shelves George would need to accommodate all these beverages.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of shelves George requires, we need to calculate how many cans of soda are left after each time he fills a shelf. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Start with 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas.\n2. After filling the first shelf, the remaining number of cans is 10 - 4 = 6 regular and 22 - 4 = 18 diet sodas.\n3. After the second shelf, we have 6 more regular sodas left (6 - 4 = 2) and 18 diet sodas (18 - 4 = 14).\n4. For the third shelf, the remaining count is 2 regular sodas and 14 diet sodas.\n5. The fourth shelf will completely fill the remaining two sodas.\n\n### Plan for SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n1. Define a rule named \"fridge_shelves\" that takes the number of regular sodas and diet sodas as input and calculates the minimum number of shelves required.\n2. Use a loop that iterates until both types of sodas fit on an exact number of shelves.\n3. In each iteration, subtract the capacity of four sodas (2 regular and 2 diet) from the current soda counts.\n4. Use Prolog's built-in arithmetic operations to perform these calculations.\n5. The loop should continue reducing the remaining soda counts until they can be divided by four, ensuring that the last shelf is completely filled.\n6. Capture the number of shelves when the remaining counts are exactly divisible by four.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code might look like this:\n\n```prolog\nfridge_shelves(RegularSodas, DietSodas, Shelves) :-\n    loop(RegularSodas, DietSodas, 0, Shelves).\n\nloop(Regular, Diet, ShelvesSoFar, Shelves) :-\n    Regular mod 4 =:= 0,\n    Diet mod 4 =:= 0,\n    Shelves = ShelvesSoFar + 1.\nloop(Regular, Diet, ShelvesSoFar, ShelvesFinal) :-\n    Regular > 4,\n    Diet > 4,\n    NewRegular is Regular - 4,\n    NewDiet is Diet - 4,\n    loop(NewRegular, NewDiet, ShelvesSoFar + 1, ShelvesFinal).\n```\n\nThis code employs a mod-based loop that continues until both the regular and diet sodas can be divided exactly by the capacity of four sodas per shelf.

This question relates to basic division, as the team members are to be divided into homogeneous groups of four.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of groups, we need to ascertain how many times four (the group size) fits into the total number of team members. Four goes into 28 (the number of boys) seven times, and seven is the highest whole number multiple that four can be subtracted from 28. As for the four girls, we also get one group of four. Therefore, the total number of groups is eight.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this in SWI-Prolog by setting up a straightforward calculation. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule \"number_of_groups\" that takes the total_members as input, which is the sum of the number of boys and girls.\n2. Calculate the quotient and remainder when total_members is divided by 4 (the group size).\n3. If the remainder is zero, the number of groups is equal to the quotient. If the remainder is not zero, it means there's an incomplete group, and we should round up the quotient.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this would be relatively simple:\n\n```prolog\nnumber_of_groups(TotalMembers) :-\n    Quotient is TotalMembers // 4,\n    Remainder is TotalMembers mod 4,\n    (   Remainder =:= 0 ->\n        NumberOfGroups = Quotient\n    ;   NumberOfGroups is Quotient + 1\n    ).\n```\n\nIn this code, the // operator computes the integer division (quotient) between total_members and 4, and the mod operator gives the remainder of this division.

Table 1 has 29 trays, which can be carried in exactly 3 trips (29 trays / 9 trays per trip).\n2. Table 2 has 52 trays, which would take 6 trips to clear (52 trays / 9).\n3. Henry will make more trips to clear Table 2 than Table 1, so we should base the final answer on Table 2's requirements.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use modular arithmetic in SWI-Prolog to calculate the number of trips Henry makes. Here's the step-by-step logic incorporated into the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule \"tray_trips\" that calculates the number of trips based on the total trays and Henry's capacity.\n2.

The shelter manages to find homes for 4 puppies every day. The question is how many days it would take to adopt out all the puppies and empty the shelter.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the adoption time, we need to determine how many days it would take to adopt 36 puppies, considering that four puppies are adopted each day. This is a simple division problem, where we divide the total number of puppies by the daily adoptions.\n\n### Plan:\n\nFor the SWI-Prolog code, we will perform the division operation and use the result as the adoption time. We can structure the code as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_adoption_time(TotalPuppies, DailyAdoptions, Days)` that computes the time required to adopt all puppies.\n2. Perform the division operation to find the number of days: `Days` is the integer result of dividing `TotalPuppies` by `DailyAdoptions`.\n3. Use the actual values from the problem for testing: `TotalPuppies` is 36, `DailyAdoptions` is 4, and we will calculate `Days`.\n\nWe can take advantage of Prolog's built-in arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and find the required time.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\nJohn's task of organizing his baseball cards in a binder has a specific pattern: he wants to place three cards on each page. The question is to calculate how many pages he will use after arranging all his cards. This problem involves John's old and new cards and requires us to find the total number of pages needed.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo calculate the number of pages, we need to determine how many cards John has overall and then divide that number by the cards per page. John has 8 new cards and 16 old cards. So, the total number of cards is 8 + 16 = 24 cards. \nNow, we can calculate the number of pages required: 24 cards / 3 cards per page = 8 pages. \n\nJohn will use 8 pages to organize all his baseball cards in the binder.\n\n### Plan:\nThe problem can be solved in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of pages required based on the given number of cards.

She then decides to distribute these photos across four different albums, ensuring that each album contains an equal number of pictures. The goal is to determine the number of pictures present in each of these albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of pictures evenly among the four albums. This can be achieved by performing a division operation on the total count of pictures by 4, which is the number of albums. The result of this division will represent the number of pictures in each album.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to implement a rule that calculates the number of pictures in each album based on the total count of pictures.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\nThe toy store has an initial stock of 17 giant stuffed bears, and after receiving an additional shipment of 10 bears, they need to organize these bears on shelves. The task is to determine how many shelves are required to display these stuffed bears when each shelf can hold only 9 bears.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bears remaining after each shelf is filled. We start with a total of 27 bears (17 initial bears + 10 new bears). For each shelf, we decrement the bear count by 9 until we reach a situation where the remaining bears cannot completely fill a shelf.\n\n### Plan:\nFor the Prolog code, we will define a rule that calculates the number of shelves required based on the given initial bears and the bears added through the shipment. We will use a loop to iteratively reduce the total bear count until we reach a situation where the bears cannot completely fill a shelf. Prolog's logical inference capabilities will be crucial in constructing this solution.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the code structure:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_shelves(InitialBears, ShipmentBears, Shelves)` that calculates the required number of shelves.\n2. Initialize a variable `remaining_bears` to store the total number of bears (initial + shipped).\n3. Use a loop that continues as long as `remaining_bears` can be divided by 9 (the number of bears per shelf). In each iteration:\n   - Calculate the current shelf number by adding 1 to the previous shelf number.\n   - Update `remaining_bears` by subtracting 9 from it (assuming each shelf gets 9 bears).\n4. When the loop terminates, the remaining bears won't fill a complete shelf.

The task is to calculate the total points earned based on Zoe's and her friends' collective efforts.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be approached by calculating the number of pounds collected by Zoe and her friends collectively, and then determining how many complete points they earned by dividing the total weight by 8. The remaining weight, if any, will be used to calculate the fractional part of the last, incomplete point.\n\nTo find the total points, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the combined weight of the recycled paper: Zoe's weight (25 pounds) plus her friends' weight (23 pounds) equals 48 pounds.\n2. Calculate the whole number of points earned by dividing the combined weight by the weight required for one point: 48 pounds \u00f7 8 pounds/point = 6 points.\n3. Determine if there's any remaining weight that could contribute to a fractional part of the next point. If so, calculate this fractional part. Remaining weight of 48 lb mod 8 lb = 4 pounds. This contributes to a fractional part of 0.5 points because a quarter of the last point remains.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total points earned, taking into consideration both the whole points and the fractional part.

        "question": "Victor was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 7 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, how many trips will he make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVictor's task of collecting lunch trays involves him making multiple trips, as he can only carry a limited number of trays (7) at a time. The problem requires us to determine the number of trips Victor will make to clear the trays from two different tables, one with 23 trays and the other with 5 trays.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by dividing it into two main steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of trays Victor carries in each trip from the table with 23 trays. Since he can carry only 7 trays at a time, we need to divide the larger number of trays into groups of 7.\n2. Calculate the total number of trips required by considering both tables. This will involve calculating the trips for the 5 trays, which is straightforward, as it's a single trip, and adding it to the trips required for the larger table.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will:\n\n1. Define a rule that calculates the number of trips needed to clear trays from the table with 23 trays. We'll call this `trips_for_23_trays(Trips)`.\n2. Calculate the number of trips for the table with 5 trays. This will be a constant value of 1, which we can incorporate into the final rule.\n3. Define a final rule that combines the results of both tables to calculate the total number of trips.\n\nWe'll break down the problem's logic into these defined rules, using Prolog's logical reasoning and arithmetic capabilities where necessary.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. Define `trips_for_23_trays`: This will involve finding the quotient and remainder of dividing 23 by 7. The quotient represents the number of trips without the remaining trays, and the remainder indicates the number of trays left for the final trip.\n2. The final rule, `total_trips(Trips)`, will add the trips required for the 5 trays (1) to the trips calculated for the larger table.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntrips_for_23_trays(Trips) :-\n    Quotient is 23 // 7,\n    Remainder is 23 mod 7,\n    Trips is Quotient + (1 * Remainder).\n\ntotal_trips(Trips) :-\n    trips_for_23_trays(X),\n    Trips is X + 1.\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's inference engine to solve the problem efficiently, demonstrating how logical reasoning can be applied to real-world scenarios.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNed started with a generous gesture towards his little brother by giving him seven boxes of chocolate candy. Now, Ned has left with a reduced quantity of chocolate boxes. The question is how many boxes of chocolate are left with Ned. Each box contains a fixed number of chocolates, adding a mathematical element to the problem.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can solve this problem by performing a simple mathematical calculation. Ned initially had 14 boxes, and giving seven of them away leaves him with a remaining 7 boxes. Since each box contains 6 pieces, we can multiply the number of boxes by the pieces per box to find the total number of pieces Ned has left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog, we will write a rule that takes into account the number of boxes Ned has and the pieces within each box, and then perform the multiplication to find the final count.

The remaining players now have a specific number of lives among them. The task is to determine the total number of lives left after each player who remained has five lives.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of players who continued playing the game after the five players quit. This can be done by finding the difference between the initial number of players and those who quit. Once we have the number of remaining players, we can simply multiply the number of lives per remaining player to find the total lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to construct a rule that computes the total number of lives based on the number of remaining players and lives per player.

However, Henry has a forgetful moment and fails to mow a significant number of lawns.

Henry was supposed to mow 12 lawns, but due to his forgetfulness, he didn't mow 7 of them.\n2. The number of lawns he actually mowed is the difference between the total lawns and the forgotten lawns: 12 - 7 = 5 lawns.\n3.

The question is to determine the total cost for a group of 12 people, with 7 of them being children.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total cost, we need to distinguish between the number of adult meals and child meals. The group of 12 people consists of 7 kids and the remaining 5 adults. The cost for the adult meals is straightforward\u2014it's just $3 multiplied by the number of adults. \n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total cost based on the number of adults and children in the group.

Define a Rule:\nStart by defining a rule `restaurant_bill` that takes the number of adults and children as arguments and computes the total cost.\n\n#### 2. Calculate Adult Cost:\nMultiply the number of adults by the cost per adult meal to find the total cost for the adults.\n\n#### 3. Determine Total Cost:\nSince kids eat free, the total cost is directly related to the number of adults.\n\n#### 4. Convert Data Type:\nEnsure that the final result is presented as an integer, as it represents a monetary value.\n\n#### 5. Test the Rule:\nProvide specific values based on the problem at hand: 5 adults and 7 children.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nrestaurant_bill(Adults, Children, TotalCost) :-\n    AdultMealCost is 3,\n    TotalCost is Adults * AdultMealCost.\n```\n\nThis code uses logical inference and arithmetic operations to compute the total cost efficiently, showcasing how Prolog can be applied to real-world scenarios with unique constraints.",

The task is to determine the total cost required to complete Jerry's collection.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be approached by calculating the cost of the missing action figures. Since Jerry needs nine more figures, we multiply the cost of one figure by nine to find the total cost.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to create a rule that computes the total cost based on the number of action figures Jerry already has and the number he needs.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe painter has a task of painting a total of 12 rooms, and each room requires 7 hours of work to complete. If he has already painted 5 rooms, we need to calculate how long it will take him to finish the remaining rooms. This remaining time can be found by multiplying the number of remaining rooms by the hours needed per room.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into a simple arithmetic calculation:\n\n1. Determine the number of remaining rooms by subtracting the number of rooms already painted from the total number of rooms.\n2. Multiply the number of remaining rooms by the hours required to paint one room.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to quickly calculate the remaining time. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_rooms(TotalRooms, PaintedRooms, RemainingRooms)` that calculates the number of remaining rooms. This will take the total number of rooms and the number of painted rooms as input and output the remaining rooms.\n\n2. Define a rule `calculate_time(RemainingRooms, HoursPerRoom, TotalTime)` that computes the total time required based on the number of remaining rooms and the hours needed per room.\n\n3.

        "question": "Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 8 bars total and Emily sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily has a box of chocolate bars, with each bar costing $4. The box contains 8 chocolate bars in total. She decides to sell all but 3 of them, which means she'll be selling half of the bars in the box. We need to find out how much money Emily would make from selling these bars.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by first determining half of the bars in the box, which will help us find out the number of bars sold. From there, we can calculate the total revenue.\n\n1. Half of the bars in the box would be 8 bars / 2 = 4 bars.\n2. The number of bars sold would therefore be 8 - 3 = 5 bars.\n3. The total revenue would be the price of one bar multiplied by the number of bars sold: $4 * 5 bars = $20.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe'll create a Prolog rule that takes the number of bars in the box and calculates the revenue based on selling all but 3 of them. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `chocolate_revenue` that takes the `number_of_bars` in the box as an input and returns the total revenue.\n2. Calculate half of the number of bars in the box by using the ISO standard predicate `divide(NumberBars, 2, HalfBars)`.\n3. Compute the number of bars sold by subtracting 3 from the total bars: `NumberBars - 3`.\n4. Find the total revenue by multiplying the price of one bar ($4) with the number of bars sold.\n5. Use Prolog's unification to combine the computed revenue with the `TotalRevenue` variable.\n\nThe Prolog code for this scenario could look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate revenue from selling chocolate bars\nchocolate_revenue(number_of_bars, total_revenue) :-\n    HalfBars is divide(number_of_bars, 2),\n    BarsSold is number_of_bars - 3,\n    TotalRevenue is 4 * BarsSold.  % Price of one bar is $4\n\n% Example query to find the total revenue with a given number of bars\n% ?- chocolate_revenue(8, TotalRevenue).\n% This should output the total revenue.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code demonstrates how logical rules can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as computing revenue, by using built-in predicates for basic arithmetic and logical unification.",

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named \"chocolate_earnings\" that takes the price of one bar (`PricePerBar`) and the total number of bars in the box (`TotalBars`) as parameters.\n2. Calculate the number of bars sold by subtracting the number of unsold bars (3) from the `TotalBars`.\n3. Multiply the number of sold bars by the `PricePerBar` to get the `TotalEarnings`.\n4. Use swi-prolog's unification feature to display the earned amount.\n\nThe Prolog code for this plan would look like:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate earnings from selling chocolate bars\nchocolate_earnings(PricePerBar, TotalBars, Earnings) :-\n    SoldBars is TotalBars - 3,\n    Earnings is SoldBars * PricePerBar.\n\n% Example query to find the earnings with given parameters\n% ?- chocolate_earnings(3, 9, Earnings).\n% This should output the total earnings with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates how Prolog can be used to efficiently solve word problems involving simple mathematical calculations and variable relationships.",

The task is to determine how many cages were used to accommodate the leftover puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of remaining puppies after the sales and then calculate how many cages were required to house them. We can accomplish this by dividing the number of remaining puppies by the capacity of each cage, making sure that no cage exceeds the intended capacity of five puppies.\n\n### Plan:\n\nIn our SWI-Prolog code, we will define rules and predicates that calculate the number of remaining puppies and then determine the required number of cages.

We need to determine how many folders Megan ended up with after organizing her files.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we should first determine the number of files Megan has left after deleting 21 files. Then, we need to divide these files evenly into folders, determining the number of folders required.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to mathematically solve this problem by defining predicates that calculate the number of remaining files and the number of folders required. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_files(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, LeftFiles)` where `LeftFiles` is the number of files Megan has left after deleting some files.\n2. Define a predicate `number_of_folders(LeftFiles, FilesPerFolder, NumFolders)` where `Number_of_Folders` is the number of folders Megan needs to have an equal number of files in each.\n3. Use arithmetic operations in SWI-Prolog to perform the calculations and find the final answer.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will involve dividing the remaining files by the files per folder, ensuring that the operation returns a whole number of folders. We will also need to convert the remaining files into a divisible quantity, as not all numbers of files will work as the number in a folder.\n\n```prolog\nremaining_files(Total, Deleted, Left) :- Left is Total - Deleted.\n\nnumber_of_folders(LeftFiles, FilesPerFolder, NumFolders) :-\n    NumFolders is ceil(LeftFiles / FilesPerFolder).\n\nmegan_folders(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, FilesPerFolder, Folders) :-\n    remaining_files(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, LeftFiles),\n    number_of_folders(LeftFiles, FilesPerFolder, Folders).\n```\n\nBy using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and the `ceil` function for rounding up to the nearest integer, we can solve this problem efficiently and determine the exact number of folders Megan needs.",

To complete this task, Oliver needs to find the number of shelves required to accommodate all the remaining books. Each shelf can hold four books, so calculating the number of shelves needed is a straightforward division problem.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break this problem down into a single step: determining the number of shelves required based on the number of remaining books.

Here's a systematic approach to creating the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_shelves` that calculates the required number of shelves. This rule will determine the remainder of a division operation, ensuring that the number of books can be evenly distributed among the shelves.\n\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily's gardening activity involves planting seeds in both a big garden and multiple small gardens. The number of seeds remaining after planting in the big garden is divided by the number of seeds planted in each small garden to determine the total number of small gardens.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break down this problem into the following steps to calculate the number of small gardens:\n\n1. Emily plants 29 seeds in the big garden, leaving her with the remainder when dividing the total number of seeds by 4.\n2. The number of small gardens is found by dividing the remainder from step 1 by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog's logical reasoning and arithmetic operations to calculate the number of small gardens. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_seeds_big_garden(TotalSeeds, SeedsPlantedBigGarden, RemainingSeeds)` that calculates the number of seeds remaining after planting in the big garden.

The remaining apples after the distribution will be used for pie-making. We know that each pie requires 6 apples, so we need to determine how many pies can be made with the leftover apples.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we must first calculate the number of apples left after lunch. This can be done by subtracting the number of apples handed out to students from the initial count. Then, we can divide the remaining apples by the number of apples needed for one pie. The quotient will give us the number of pies that can be baked.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog's mathematical capabilities to construct a code that provides a clear and concise solution to this problem.

After a certain number of cages are filled, we can determine how many cages are used to accommodate all the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by first calculating the remainder when the total number of puppies is divided by the number of puppies per cage. This will give us the number of puppies left over after filling cages completely. If this number is greater than four (the capacity of each cage), we will need one more cage. The number of cages used is then incremented. This process is repeated until the leftover puppies can fit into the remaining cage.\n\nIn summary, we need to find the minimum number of cages required to house the unsold puppies.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will construct a SWI-Prolog code to determine the number of cages required.

He decides to wash some of the clothes in one load, while distributing the remaining items evenly across five smaller loads. The task at hand is to determine how many articles of clothing are in each of the small, equal loads.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to calculate the total number of pieces of clothing remaining after one load has been washed, and then divide this number by the desired number of smaller loads to find the quantity of items in each.\n\n1. **Clothing Remaining**: Begin with 39 pieces of clothing. Remove 19 pieces for the first load, leaving 20 pieces for the small loads.\n2. **Division into Small Loads**: Divide the remaining 20 pieces by the number of small loads to find the quantity of clothing in each load.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will create a SWI-Prolog code to solve this problem by defining predicates that represent the analytical steps outlined above.

He has a pile of books to put away, but a librarian takes ten books from that pile, leaving Mike with the remaining books to shelve. Mike aims to arrange the books efficiently on shelves, and he can fit nine books on each shelf. The task is to determine how many shelves he will require to accommodate all the remaining books.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Number of Books Remaining**: From the initial 82 books, a librarian takes 10 books, leaving Mike with the remainder. We need to calculate this remaining quantity of books.\n\n2. **Shelves Required**: After determining the number of remaining books, we can calculate the number of shelves needed by dividing the books evenly into batches of nine.\n\n3. **Final Count**: We must ensure that the last batch of books does not exceed the shelf capacity, which might happen if the remaining books don't divide evenly by nine.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to implement a logical solution to Mike's shelving problem.

The plan involves creating predicates that represent each step of the analysis and then using these predicates to build towards the solution.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `emily_points/1` to represent Emily's individual score.\n   - `remaining_team_points/1` to find the total points scored by the rest of the team.\n   - `total_team_score/2` to calculate the sum of Emily's points and the team's points.\n   - `number_of_players/2` to determine the count of players by dividing the total team score by the points scored by each player.\n\n2. **Implement the Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define the relationships between the predicates.\n   - Utilize arithmetic operations within the predicates for calculations.\n\n3. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - Combine the predicates in a logical flow to solve for the number of players on Emily's team.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will follow this structure, leveraging the defined predicates and Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n```prolog\nemily_points(23).\nremaining_team_points(X) :-\n    X is (TotalPlayers - 1) * 2,\n    TotalPlayers = ?.\ntotal_team_score(Total, EmilyScore) :-\n    Total is EmilyScore + X,\n    remaining_team_points(X).\nnumber_of_players(TotalPlayers, EmilyScore) :-\n    total_team_score(Total, EmilyScore),\n    TotalPlayers is Total // 2.\n\nquery(EmilyScore) :-\n    emily_points(EmilyScore),\n    number_of_players(Players, EmilyScore),\n    write(Players).\n```\n\nIn this code, we start with defining Emily's score as a fact. The remaining predicates are then used to build up the solution, with `query/1` serving as the entry point to initiate the calculation with Emily's score. This approach allows us to break down the problem and construct a clear logical flow in the Prolog code.",

The task is to determine how many tables are needed to seat these guests, considering each table accommodates five people.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate how many tables can fit five people each when the total number of attendees is 40. This can be done by dividing the total number of attendees by the capacity of each table.\n\n### Plan:\n\nIn our SWI-Prolog code, we will define a predicate that takes the total number of attendees as input and calculates the required number of tables.

However, since the number of people per table (8) may not evenly divide the remaining customer count, we need to consider the quotient and remainder of this division.\n\n3. **Determining Residual Tables**: If the quotient represents the number of full tables, the remainder indicates the number of extra people, which would require one additional table.\n\n### Plan:\n\nIn the SWI-Prolog code, we will embody the analysis by defining predicates that gradually break down the problem.

We need to determine how many shelves are required to accommodate the remaining books after a certain number of them were sold.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Calculate the number of coloring books remaining in stock after the sale. This can be done by subtracting the number of books sold from the initial stock: `Remaining Books = Initial Stock - Books Sold`.\n2. Determine the number of shelves needed. Since each shelf holds 9 books, we can divide the number of remaining books by 9 to find the required number of shelves: `Number of Shelves = Remaining Books / 9`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to implement a rule that computes the number of shelves needed based on the given parameters. The plan involves defining this rule and using Prolog's logic and arithmetic capabilities to deduce the answer. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `number_of_shelves(InitialStock, BooksSold, Shelves)` that represents the problem. `InitialStock` is the total number of books in stock initially, `BooksSold` is the number of books sold, and `Shelves` is the resulting number of shelves needed.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining books after the sale: `RemainingBooks = 120 - 39`.\n3.

To find the number of students in each group, we can divide the total number of picked students by three.\n\n### Plan:\n\n- Define a SWI-Prolog rule that calculates the group size based on the number of students who got picked.\n- Use Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform the division and find the quotient.\n- Ensure that the logic of dividing the picked students into three groups is clearly represented in the code.\n\nHere's the detailed breakdown of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_group_size(NumberOfPickedStudents, GroupSize)` that takes the number of students who got picked and calculates the size of each group.\n2. Use Prolog's arithmetic operations to divide `NumberOfPickedStudents` by 3, and assign the quotient to `GroupSize`.\n3. Instanciate the number of picked students with the value 12, which we obtained from the problem statement.\n\nHere's the code outline based on this strategy:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the group size based on the number of picked students\ncalculate_group_size(NumberOfPickedStudents, GroupSize) :-\n    GroupSize is NumberOfPickedStudents // 3.\n\n% Query with the actual number of picked students (12) to find the group size\nquery_group_size :-\n    calculate_group_size(12, GroupSize),\n    write(GroupSize).\n```\n\nBy querying `query_group_size`, Prolog will infer the logic and provide us with the correct group size for the trivia teams.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are told that Katie's team won a dodgeball game with a total of 12 points. Katie personally scored four points, and each of her teammates scored four points as well. We need to determine the number of players on Katie's team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can break it down into a few steps:\n\n1. Understand that the total score of 12 points can be divided into four parts, with Katie's four points being one part, and the remaining three parts belonging to her teammates.\n2. Establish that each of Katie's teammates also scored four points, which means their individual scores contribute another four points to the total score.\n3. Calculate the number of teammates by dividing the remaining points (8 points) by the points scored by each teammate (4 points).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to implement this solution by defining a logical relationship between the given information and the number of players. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_teammates(TotalPoints, KatiePoints, Teammates)` that takes the total points and Katie's points as input and returns the number of teammates.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMegan has a surplus of cupcakes from her baking endeavor for the school bake sale. Unfortunately, Todd's appetite got the better of him, and he consumed a significant number of them. Megan is now left with a reduced quantity of cupcakes. To organize these remaining cupcakes, Megan plans to distribute them into packages, each containing seven cupcakes. The goal is to determine how many packages she can make under these circumstances.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to determine the number of packages Megan can create, considering that 43 cupcakes were consumed by Todd, and each package requires 7 cupcakes. Our approach will be to calculate the remainder of cupcakes and then divide them by the number of cupcakes per package.\n\n1. Cupcakes remaining after Todd's indulgence: 71 - 43 = 28 cupcakes.\n2. Number of packages: We divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package, which is 7. Therefore, we have 28 \u00f7 7 = 4 packages.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by establishing a relationship between the total cupcakes and the number of packages. We will utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `cupcake_packages` that accepts the total number of cupcakes and the number of cupcakes per package as arguments and returns the number of packages.\n2.

She placed 27 pictures in one primary album, while the remaining 18 pictures were distributed evenly across nine different albums. Our goal is to determine the number of pictures present in each album.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the remaining pictures, which are 18 in number, among nine albums.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe scenario involves selecting students for school trivia teams. There are 58 students trying out, and after some are not picked for the team, the remaining students need to be divided into an equal number of groups. The goal is to determine the number of students in each group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of students per group, follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of students who weren't picked for the team. This is a fixed value given as 10 students.\n\n2. Calculate the number of remaining students by subtracting the students who didn't get picked from the total trying out.\n\n3. Divide the remaining students evenly among the groups.

Define a constant for the number of students who didn't get picked (NotPicked).\n\n2. Use a mathematical inference predicate such as `remaining_students` to calculate the number of students left after the ones who weren't picked. This can be done by subtracting NotPicked from the total number of students (TotalStudents).\n\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem relates to a company's luncheon plans being impacted by no-shows. Initially, the company invited 24 guests, but unfortunately, 10 of them didn't attend. The company had planned to seat these guests at tables meant for seven people each. Now, the task is to determine how many tables will be needed to accommodate the attendees.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the required number of tables, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of attendees who showed up by subtracting the no-shows from the initial invitees: 24 - 10 = 14 attendees.\n2. Perform a division to determine the required number of tables by dividing the total number of attendees by the seating capacity of each table: 14 attendees / 7 seats per table.\n3. Since we're dealing with whole tables, we should ensure the division result is rounded up to the nearest integer.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by creating a rule that determines the necessary number of tables based on the attendance and table seating capacity. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `required_tables` that takes the number of initial_invitees and seating_capacity as input and computes the required number of tables.\n2. Calculate the number of attendees who showed up by subtracting the number of no-shows from the initial invitees.\n3. Divide the number of attendees by the seating capacity to find the number of tables. Round this result up to the nearest integer using SWI-Prolog's `ceil` function.\n4.

Haley puts 3 seeds in each small garden, so the number of small gardens can be found by dividing the remaining seeds by 3.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of small gardens based on the given information. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `haley_small_gardens(TotalSeeds, SeedsBigGarden, SeedsPerSmallGarden, NumberOfSmallGardens)` that takes in the total seeds, seeds used in the big garden, and seeds used in each small garden, and computes the number of small gardens.\n2. Calculate the remaining seeds after using SeedsBigGarden in the big garden: `RemainingSeeds = TotalSeeds - SeedsBigGarden`.\n3. Divide the remaining seeds by SeedsPerSmallGarden to find the number of small gardens: `NumberOfSmallGardens = RemainingSeeds / SeedsPerSmallGarden`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the above calculations and logic.\n\nHere's the sample SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of small gardens\nhaley_small_gardens(total_seeds, seeds_big_garden, seeds_per_small_garden, number_of_small_gardens) :-\n    remaining_seeds is total_seeds - seeds_big_garden,\n    number_of_small_gardens is remaining_seeds // seeds_per_small_garden.\n\n% Query to find the number of small gardens with the given values\nquery_small_gardens(NumberOfSmallGardens) :-\n    haley_small_gardens(56, 35, 3, NumberOfSmallGardens).\n```\n\nThis code uses logical inferences to calculate the number of small gardens Haley has, demonstrating SWI-Prolog's ability to solve real-world problems involving logical relationships and calculations.",

Initially, there are 14 books that need to be put away, but a librarian takes two of them, leaving Roger with the remainder. Roger wants to arrange the books efficiently on the shelves, and he can fit three books comfortably on each shelf. The task is to determine how many shelves Roger will require to arrange all the remaining books.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of books Roger has after the librarian takes two away. Then, we should determine how many times we can fit three books on a shelf until the remaining books are placed.\n\n1. Roger has 14 books, and a librarian takes 2 away, leaving him with 12 books to organize.\n2. Roger can fit 3 books on one shelf, so we need to divide the number of remaining books by 3 to find the number of shelves required.\n3. For the remaining 12 books, we need 4 shelves because 12 / 3 = 4, and there's no remainder. \n\n### Plan:\n\nNow, let's formulate a plan to write the SWI-Prolog code for this problem:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_shelves` that takes into account the total_books and books_per_shelf variables, representing the total number of books Roger has and the number of books he can fit on one shelf, respectively.\n2. Create a variable for the number of remaining books after the librarian takes two away, by subtracting 2 from total_books.\n3.

The task is to determine how many cages are required to accommodate the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to calculate the remainder when 56 puppies are divided by 4, which is the number of puppies placed in each cage.

The task is to determine how many pies the cafeteria staff can make with the remaining apples.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to calculate the number of apples left after the lunches, and then divide this number by the number of apples needed for each pie.\n\n1. Calculate the number of apples left after lunch: `Remaining Apples = Total Apples - Apples for Lunch = 86 - 30 = 56 apples`.\n2.

For the remaining 20 pieces, he plans to divide them evenly across five separate loads. Understanding this division of labor saves time and effort. \n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many items go into each of the small loads, we should first determine the total number of remaining items that need to be divided into five loads. This can be done by subtracting the items that have already been placed in the first load. Therefore, we have:\n\n20 remaining pieces of clothing - 40 pieces already in the first load = 60 pieces in total / 5 loads. \n\nThis simplifies to 12 pieces of clothing that need to be divided across the five loads.\n\n### Plan:\n\nNow, to implement this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can follow this strategy:\n\n1.

        "question": "For Halloween Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. She ate 12 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 5 in each pile. How many piles could she make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca's Halloween haul of 32 pieces of candy is the subject of this problem. After eating 12 pieces, Bianca attempts to distribute the remaining candy into piles with five pieces in each pile. The goal is to determine how many piles she could make.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by breaking down the steps as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the number of candies left after Bianca ate 12 pieces: RemainingCandies = TotalCandies - CandiesEaten, which is 32 - 12 = 20 candies.\n2. Determine the number of piles Bianca can make while ensuring each pile has five candies: NumberOfPiles = RemainingCandies / CandiesPerPile, where CandiesPerPile is 5.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog, we'll define a rule that calculates the number of piles Bianca can make based on the given conditions. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Create a rule named `number_of_piles` that accepts the total number of candies and the number of candies per pile as arguments and returns the number of piles.\n2. Calculate the remaining candies after eating 12 pieces by subtracting the number of candies eaten from the total candies.\n3. Compute the number of piles by dividing the remaining candies by the candies per pile.\n4.

Luke then decides to pack the unsold games into boxes, with each box containing two games. The task is to determine how many boxes Luke will need to store or display the remaining games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can solve this problem by dividing the number of remaining games by the games per box.\n\n1. Luke has 18 unsold games: 57 initial games - 39 sold games = 18 remaining games.\n2. Each box contains two games, so the number of boxes is determined by dividing the remaining games by 2: 18 / 2 = 9 boxes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog, we can construct a rule that calculates the number of boxes required based on the remaining games and the games packed into each box.

She decided to organize these files by deleting some and distributing the rest across folders, each containing exactly five files. The task is to determine how many folders Katie ended up with after this organization process.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of folders, we need to ascertain how many files were not deleted, as these are the ones placed into the folders. Katie deleted 40 files, so we subtract this number from the initial count, leaving us with the number of files that were not deleted. \n\nNext, we need to divide this remaining number by the specified number of files per folder, which is 5.

        "question": "Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSarah's delicious cupcakes for the bake sale are in danger of being gobbled up by her brother, Todd. After he eats 14 of them, we need to determine how many packages Sarah can make, each containing 8 cupcakes. This problem involves calculating the remaining cupcakes and dividing them into packages of 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can break this problem into three main steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cupcakes remaining after Todd's snack session. Subtract 14 (cupcakes eaten by Todd) from 38 (the total cupcakes baked).\n2. Divide the remaining cupcakes by the capacity of each package (8 cupcakes per package). This will give us the number of packages.\n3. We might also need to add an extra step to handle any potential remainder if the remaining cupcakes aren't an exact multiple of the package size.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this in SWI-Prolog as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule named `cupcake_packages` that takes in the total_cupcakes (the initial number of cupcakes), cupcakes_eaten (the number eaten by Todd), and cupcakes_per_package (the number of cupcakes per package).\n2. Calculate the remaining_cupcakes by subtracting cupcakes_eaten from total_cupcakes.\n3. Use integer division (//) to determine the number_of_packages, rounding down since we can't have a fraction of a package.\n4. Optionally, we could add a step to calculate the remainder and output it along with the number of packages.\n\nHere's the Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating the number of packages\ncupcake_packages(TotalCupcakes, CupcakesEaten, CupcakesPerPackage, NumberOfPackages) :-\n    RemainingCupcakes is TotalCupcakes - CupcakesEaten,\n    NumberOfPackages is RemainingCupcakes // CupcakesPerPackage.\n\n% Example query to find the number of packages for the given scenario\n% ?- cupcake_packages(38, 14, 8, NumberOfPackages).\n% This should output the number of packages Sarah can make.\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code demonstrates how logical rules can be applied to real-world scenarios, helping us solve practical problems involving arithmetic operations and logical relationships.",

        "question": "Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNancy has uploaded a batch of 41 pictures to Facebook and organized them into albums. The majority of the pictures, 37 in count, were placed into a single album, while the remaining pictures were divided across two other albums. The task is to determine the number of pictures in each of these two albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by first finding out the total number of pictures that were not placed in the more extensive album. This can be done by subtracting the pictures in the large album from the total uploaded. Once we have this value, we can divide it by two, as this represents the number of pictures in each of the two smaller albums.\n\n### Plan:\nFor this task in SWI-Prolog, we will:\n\n1. Define a rule named `picture_distribution` that takes in the total number of pictures (`TotalPics`) and the number of pictures in the large album (`LargeAlbumPics`).\n2. Calculate the number of pictures not in the large album by subtracting `LargeAlbumPics` from `TotalPics`.\n3. Divide this number by 2 to find the Number of Pictures in Each Small Album.\n\nThe following is the Prolog code to implement this:\n\n```prolog\n% Rule to distribute remaining pictures into two albums\npicture_distribution(TotalPics, LargeAlbumPics, RemainingPics, PicturesInEachAlbum) :-\n    RemainingPics is TotalPics - LargeAlbumPics,\n    PicturesInEachAlbum is RemainingPics // 2.  % Use integer division\n```\n\nWe can query this rule with the total number of pictures and the number of pictures in the primary album to obtain the desired distribution.
