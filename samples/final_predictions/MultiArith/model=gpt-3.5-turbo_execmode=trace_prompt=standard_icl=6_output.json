                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given a relationship between the ages of Tom's brother and Tom's dog. Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `dog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears)` that takes the brother's age in six years and computes the dog's age in six years.\n2. Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the age of Tom's dog in six years based on the given conditions."

The task is to calculate the total cost of the meal and then determine how much each friend must pay if the bill is split equally among them. The items ordered include a Taco Salad, Dave's Single hamburgers, sets of french fries, and cups of peach lemonade, each with specific costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much each friend pays, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each item:\n   - Taco Salad: $10\n   - Dave's Single hamburgers: 5 orders at $5 each = $25\n   - French fries: 4 sets at $2.50 each = $10\n   - Peach lemonade: 5 cups at $2 each = $10\n\n2. Sum up these costs to get the total bill:\n   - Total bill = $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (Hamburgers) + $10 (Fries) + $10 (Lemonade) = $55\n\n3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend pays:\n   - Each friend pays = Total bill / 5\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_bill\" that takes variables for each item's cost and the number of friends.\n2. Assign constants to the costs of individual items (e.g., cost of Taco Salad, cost of a hamburger).\n3. Compute the total cost for each type of item by multiplying the unit cost with the quantity ordered.\n4. Sum up all these total costs to get the final bill.\n5. Divide the final bill by the number of friends to determine how much each friend pays.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define costs of items\nitem_cost(taco_salad, 10).\nitem_cost(hamburger, 5).\nitem_cost(fries, 2.5).\nitem_cost(lemonade, 2).\n\n% Calculate total cost of an item type\ntotal_item_cost(Item, Quantity, TotalCost) :-\n    item_cost(Item, CostPerItem),\n    TotalCost is CostPerItem * Quantity.\n\n% Calculate the total bill and how much each friend pays\ncalculate_bill(NumFriends, EachPays) :-\n    total_item_cost(taco_salad, 1, TotalTacoSalad),\n    total_item_cost(hamburger, 5, TotalHamburgers),\n    total_item_cost(fries, 4, TotalFries),\n    total_item_cost(lemonade, 5, TotalLemonade),\n    TotalBill is TotalTacoSalad + TotalHamburgers + TotalFries + TotalLemonade,\n    EachPays is TotalBill / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost of each item, calculates the total cost for each type of item based on the quantity, sums these to get the total bill, and finally computes the amount each friend pays by dividing the total bill by the number of friends."

The blue weights each weigh 2 pounds, and the green weights each weigh 3 pounds. He uses 4 blue weights and 5 green weights. Additionally, the bar itself has a weight of 2 pounds. To find the total weight of the bar with the weights, we need to calculate the weight contributed by each color of weight and add it to the bar's weight.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by calculating the total weight for each type of weight and then adding these weights together along with the bar's weight:\n1. Calculate the total weight of the blue weights: Number of blue weights multiplied by the weight of each blue weight.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the green weights: Number of green weights multiplied by the weight of each green weight.\n3. Add the weights of the blue and green weights to the weight of the bar to get the total weight.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total weight based on the given input of the number of each type of weight and the weight of the bar. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_weight` that takes five parameters: the number of blue weights (`NumBlue`), the number of green weights (`NumGreen`), the weight of each blue weight (`WeightBlue`), the weight of each green weight (`WeightGreen`), and the weight of the bar (`WeightBar`).\n2. Calculate the total weight contributed by the blue weights as `NumBlue * WeightBlue`.\n3. Calculate the total weight contributed by the green weights as `NumGreen * WeightGreen`.\n4. Sum the weights from the blue weights, green weights, and the bar to get the `TotalWeight`.\n5. Use swi-prolog's ability to perform arithmetic operations and unify the result with `TotalWeight`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total weight\ntotal_weight(NumBlue, NumGreen, WeightBlue, WeightGreen, WeightBar, TotalWeight) :-\n    TotalBlueWeight is NumBlue * WeightBlue,\n    TotalGreenWeight is NumGreen * WeightGreen,\n    TotalWeight is TotalBlueWeight + TotalGreenWeight + WeightBar.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total weight\n% ?- total_weight(4, 5, 2, 3, 2, TotalWeight).\n% This should output the total weight with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total weight of Harry's custom weight bar setup using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing the power of Prolog in handling mathematical tasks through logical rules."

He has already received commitments from half the class and is working to persuade additional voters. The task involves calculating the total number of votes Alec has secured and determining how many additional votes he needs to reach his goal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Votes Required**: Alec needs three-quarters of the total class votes.\n   - Total class size = 60\n   - Required votes = 3/4 of 60 = 45 votes\n\n2. **Current Votes Secured**: Half of the class has already agreed to vote for Alec.\n   - Votes from half the class = 1/2 of 60 = 30 votes\n\n3. **Additional Votes from Undecided Students**: Out of the remaining students, only 5 were considering voting for him initially. After further campaigning, a fifth of the remaining students (who were not already considering him) decided to vote for him.\n   - Remaining students after 30 commitments = 60 - 30 = 30 students\n   - Initially undecided but considering = 5\n   - Remaining students not considering Alec initially = 30 - 5 = 25\n   - Additional votes after campaigning = 1/5 of 25 = 5 votes\n\n4. **Total Votes After Campaigning**: Sum of votes from committed and persuaded students.\n   - Total votes after initial and additional campaigning = 30 (initially committed) + 5 (initially undecided) + 5 (converted from non-considering) = 40 votes\n\n5. **Votes Needed to Reach Goal**: Subtract the total votes Alec has from the required votes.\n   - Additional votes needed = 45 (goal) - 40 (current) = 5 votes\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how many more votes Alec needs based on the input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_students/1` to hold the total number of students.\n   - `votes_required/2` to calculate the number of votes needed to win.\n   - `initial_votes/2` to calculate the votes Alec initially secured.\n   - `undecided_votes/2` to calculate the votes from students initially undecided.\n   - `additional_campaign_votes/3` to calculate the additional votes from non-considering students after campaigning.\n   - `total_current_votes/2` to sum up all votes Alec has after campaigning.\n   - `votes_needed/3` to calculate how many more votes Alec needs to reach his goal.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of students and check if the output matches the expected number of additional votes needed (5 votes).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values."

Each video game costs $45, and each book costs $5. By the end of the summer, Kenny has mowed 35 lawns and wants to buy 5 video games. We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently."

Define a predicate `remaining_candy(DebbyCandy, SisterCandy, PiecesEaten, Remaining)` that takes the number of pieces of candy Debby had, the number of pieces her sister had, the number of pieces eaten, and calculates the remaining pieces of candy.\n2. Calculate the total initial candy by adding Debby's candy and her sister's candy.\n3. Subtract the pieces eaten from the total to find the remaining pieces of candy.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the subtraction and return the result.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code might look based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating remaining candy\nremaining_candy(DebbyCandy, SisterCandy, PiecesEaten, Remaining) :-\n    TotalCandy is DebbyCandy + SisterCandy,\n    Remaining is TotalCandy - PiecesEaten.\n\n% Query to find the remaining candy pieces\n% ?- remaining_candy(32, 42, 35, Remaining).\n% This query will calculate the remaining pieces of candy after the first night.\n```\n\nBy defining the logical relationships and calculations in the Prolog code, we can accurately determine the number of pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left after consuming 35 pieces on the first night. The code structure allows for easy testing and verification of the solution.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Rachel purchased two coloring books with different numbers of pictures in each. After one week, she had already colored a certain number of pictures. The task is to determine how many pictures Rachel still has left to color by subtracting the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures in both books.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures in both coloring books by summing the number of pictures in each book.\n2. Subtract the number of pictures Rachel has already colored from the total number of pictures to find out how many pictures she still has to color.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of pictures Rachel still has to color based on the given information. Here\u2019s how the plan can be structured:\n\n1. Define a predicate `pictures_left(PicturesLeft)` that calculates the number of pictures Rachel still has to color.\n2. Define facts for the number of pictures in each coloring book.\n3. Calculate the total number of pictures by summing the pictures in both books.\n4. Subtract the number of pictures Rachel has already colored from the total to find the remaining pictures.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the subtraction and determine the number of pictures left.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of pictures in each coloring book\npictures_in_book(book1, 23).\npictures_in_book(book2, 32).\n\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of pictures Rachel still has to color\npictures_left(PicturesLeft) :-\n    pictures_in_book(book1, PicturesBook1),\n    pictures_in_book(book2, PicturesBook2),\n    TotalPictures is PicturesBook1 + PicturesBook2,\n    PicturesColored = 44,\n    PicturesLeft is TotalPictures - PicturesColored.\n```\n\nThis code defines the number of pictures in each book, calculates the total number of pictures, subtracts the number of pictures Rachel has already colored, and computes the number of pictures she still has left to color. By querying `pictures_left(PicturesLeft)`, SWI-Prolog will calculate and return the number of pictures Rachel still needs to color.",

Unfortunately, 19 of the games turned out to be faulty and didn't work. The task is to determine how many good games Ned ended up with after accounting for the faulty ones.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of games Ned acquired by adding the games from his friend and the garage sale: 11 games + 22 games = 33 games.\n2. Subtract the number of faulty games from the total to find out how many good games he has left: Total games - Faulty games = Good games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of good games Ned ended up with based on the given information. The plan involves setting up predicates to perform the necessary calculations and determine the final count of good games.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_games_acquired(FriendGames, GarageSaleGames, TotalGames)` to calculate the total number of games Ned acquired.\n2. Define a predicate `good_games(TotalGames, FaultyGames, GoodGames)` to calculate the number of good games Ned ended up with.\n3.

The task is to determine how many shirts Dave did not wash out of the total number he had.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many shirts Dave did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of shirts Dave did not wash based on the given information.\n\n1. Define a predicate `shirts_not_washed(TotalShortSleeve, TotalLongSleeve, Washed)` where `TotalShortSleeve` is the total number of short sleeve shirts, `TotalLongSleeve` is the total number of long sleeve shirts, and `Washed` is the total number of shirts Dave washed.\n   \n2. Calculate the total number of shirts Dave had to wash by adding the number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts.\n   \n3. Subtract the number of shirts Dave washed from the total number of shirts to find out how many shirts he did not wash.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the subtraction and return the result.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look like this:\n\n```prolog\nshirts_not_washed(TotalShortSleeve, TotalLongSleeve, Washed) :-\n    TotalShirts is TotalShortSleeve + TotalLongSleeve,\n    NotWashed is TotalShirts - Washed,\n    write('Dave did not wash '), write(NotWashed), write(' shirts.').\n```\n\nBy implementing this Prolog rule, we can efficiently calculate the number of shirts Dave did not wash based on the total number of shirts he had and the number he washed.

The task is to calculate how many pictures Haley still had from her vacation after deleting the specified number of pictures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of pictures Haley had after deleting some, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the initial total number of pictures taken by adding the pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.\n2. Subtract the number of pictures deleted from the initial total to find out how many pictures Haley still had.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule to calculate the number of pictures Haley had after deleting some. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `remaining_pictures` that takes the initial number of pictures at the zoo, the number of pictures at the museum, the number of pictures deleted, and calculates the remaining pictures.\n2. Calculate the initial total number of pictures by adding the pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.\n3. Subtract the number of pictures deleted from the initial total to find the remaining pictures.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVanessa initially had 16 music files and 48 video files on her flash drive, totaling 16 + 48 = 64 files. After deleting 30 files, we need to determine how many files are still on her flash drive.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of files Vanessa had initially by adding the music and video files.\n2. Subtract the number of files she deleted from the total to find out how many files are still on her flash drive.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the number of files remaining on Vanessa's flash drive after deleting some files. The plan involves defining predicates for the initial number of files, the number of files deleted, and the calculation for the remaining files.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_files(MusicFiles, VideoFiles, TotalFiles)` to calculate the total number of files Vanessa had initially.\n2. Define a predicate `remaining_files(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, RemainingFiles)` to calculate the number of files still on her flash drive after deleting some files.\n3. Implement the predicates with actual values from the problem (16 music files, 48 video files, and 30 files deleted).\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the subtraction and compute the number of remaining files.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of files Vanessa had initially\ntotal_files(MusicFiles, VideoFiles, TotalFiles) :-\n    TotalFiles is MusicFiles + VideoFiles.\n\n% Define the number of files remaining after deletion\nremaining_files(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, RemainingFiles) :-\n    RemainingFiles is TotalFiles - DeletedFiles.\n\n% Calculate the number of files remaining after deletion\ntotal_files(16, 48, Total),\nremaining_files(Total, 30, Remaining).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates to calculate the total number of files Vanessa had initially and the number of files remaining after deleting some files.

Only 2 students, regardless of gender, were called back, meaning the rest did not make the cut.

Calculate the total number of students who tried out by adding the number of girls and boys.\n2. Subtract the 2 students who were called back from the total number of students who tried out to find out how many students did not make the cut.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to define rules and predicates to calculate the number of students who did not make the cut based on the given information. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_students(Total)` that calculates the total number of students who tried out by adding the number of girls and boys.\n2. Define a predicate `students_not_called_back(Girls, Boys, NotCalledBack)` that subtracts the 2 students who were called back from the total number of students who tried out.\n3.

Subtract the tickets spent on the hat from the total number of tickets won to find out how many tickets Jerry has left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of tickets Jerry has left after spending some on the hat. The plan involves the following steps:\n\n1. Define a rule `tickets_left` that takes variables for the tickets won from each game, tickets spent on the hat, and calculates the remaining tickets.\n2. Calculate the total number of tickets won by adding the tickets won from 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'.\n3. Subtract the tickets spent on the hat from the total number of tickets won to determine the remaining tickets.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of tickets won from each game\ntickets_won(whack_a_mole, 29).\ntickets_won(skee_ball, 17).\n\n% Calculate the total number of tickets won\ntotal_tickets_won(TotalTickets) :-\n    tickets_won(whack_a_mole, TicketsWhackAMole),\n    tickets_won(skee_ball, TicketsSkeeBall),\n    TotalTickets is TicketsWhackAMole + TicketsSkeeBall.\n\n% Calculate the number of tickets Jerry has left after spending on the hat\ntickets_left(TicketsLeft) :-\n    total_tickets_won(TotalTickets),\n    TicketsSpentOnHat is 12,\n    TicketsLeft is TotalTickets - TicketsSpentOnHat.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the number of tickets won from each game, calculates the total number of tickets won, and then computes the number of tickets Jerry has left after spending on the hat. The logical inference in Prolog allows for straightforward calculation and deduction of the remaining tickets.",

The task is to determine the total number of worksheets the teacher would have to grade after the new submissions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of worksheets the teacher needs to grade, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The teacher initially had 29 worksheets.\n2. After grading 25 worksheets, the teacher has 29 - 25 = 4 worksheets left to grade.\n3. When another 29 worksheets are turned in, the total number of worksheets to grade becomes 4 (remaining from the initial set) + 29 (new submissions) = 33 worksheets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of worksheets the teacher needs to grade based on the given information. Here's how we can structure the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_worksheets_to_grade(InitialWorksheets, GradedWorksheets, NewWorksheets, TotalWorksheets)` that calculates the total number of worksheets to grade.\n2.

To find out how much money George made in those two days, we need to calculate his earnings based on the hours worked and the hourly wage.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings for Monday by multiplying the number of hours worked on Monday by the hourly wage.\n2. Calculate the total earnings for Tuesday by multiplying the number of hours worked on Tuesday by the hourly wage.\n3. Sum the earnings from Monday and Tuesday to find out the total amount of money George made in those two days.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to define rules and predicates that will calculate the total earnings for George based on the given information. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_earnings(Day1Hours, Day2Hours, HourlyWage, TotalEarnings)` that calculates the total earnings for George. This rule will take the number of hours worked on Monday, the number of hours worked on Tuesday, the hourly wage, and output the total earnings.\n\n2. Calculate the earnings for each day by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly wage.\n\n3. Sum the earnings from both days to get the total earnings for the two days.\n\n4.

        "question": "Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Bianca is organizing her bookcase with a specific number of books on each shelf. She has 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, with each shelf containing exactly 8 books. To find the total number of books Bianca has in total, we need to calculate the number of books on each type of shelf and then sum them up.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of books Bianca has, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of mystery books by multiplying the number of mystery shelves by the number of books per mystery shelf.\n2. Calculate the total number of picture books by multiplying the number of picture shelves by the number of books per picture shelf.\n3. Add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books Bianca has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of books based on the given number of shelves and books per shelf for mystery and picture books. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_books` that takes the number of mystery shelves, number of picture shelves, and the number of books per shelf as parameters.\n2. Calculate the total number of mystery books by multiplying the number of mystery shelves by the number of books per mystery shelf.\n3. Calculate the total number of picture books by multiplying the number of picture shelves by the number of books per picture shelf.\n4.

To find the total number of lives across all players after the new players join, we need to calculate the total number of lives collectively held by all players.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of lives across all players, we can follow these steps:\n1.

Each question is worth 3 points. To calculate George's final score, we need to determine the total number of questions answered correctly and then multiply that by the points awarded for each correct answer.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate George's final score, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of questions answered correctly by adding the number of questions answered correctly in the first half to the number answered correctly in the second half.\n2. Multiply the total number of correct answers by the points awarded for each correct answer (3 points per question) to get the final score.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this calculation in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates George's final score based on the number of questions answered correctly in each half and the points awarded per question. Here's a structured plan to achieve this:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_score` that takes the number of correct answers in the first half, the number of correct answers in the second half, and the points per question as parameters.\n2. Calculate the total number of correct answers by adding the number of correct answers in the first half to the number in the second half.\n3. Multiply the total number of correct answers by the points awarded per question to get the final score.\n4.

The plan involves setting up predicates to perform the necessary calculations and determine the total number of groups.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_players(NewPlayers, ReturningPlayers, TotalPlayers)` to calculate the total number of players.\n2. Define a predicate `calculate_groups(TotalPlayers, GroupSize, TotalGroups)` to determine the number of groups required.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and rounding up to the nearest whole number to account for any remaining players.\n\nThe Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_players(NewPlayers, ReturningPlayers, TotalPlayers) :-\n    TotalPlayers is NewPlayers + ReturningPlayers.\n\ncalculate_groups(TotalPlayers, GroupSize, TotalGroups) :-\n    TotalGroups is TotalPlayers // GroupSize + (TotalPlayers mod GroupSize > 0).\n\nbaseball_groups(NewPlayers, ReturningPlayers, GroupSize, TotalGroups) :-\n    total_players(NewPlayers, ReturningPlayers, TotalPlayers),\n    calculate_groups(TotalPlayers, GroupSize, TotalGroups).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates to calculate the total number of players and the number of groups required based on the group size. The `calculate_groups` predicate ensures that any remaining players after forming complete groups are accounted for by adding an extra group. By using Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical inference, we can accurately determine the number of groups needed to accommodate all the players.",

        "question": "A group of 3 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked but cooked 10 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a group of 3 friends went to a restaurant where the chef had already cooked 8 chicken wings. The chef then cooked an additional 10 chicken wings for the group. The task is to determine how many chicken wings each person in the group would receive if they were to split them equally.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. The chef initially had 8 chicken wings.\n2. The chef cooked an additional 10 chicken wings.\n3. The total number of chicken wings available is the sum of the initial wings and the additional wings.\n4. To find out how many wings each person would get, we divide the total number of wings by the number of friends in the group (3).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo write a SWI-Prolog code for this task, we will define a rule that calculates the number of chicken wings each person would receive. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_wings` that calculates the total number of chicken wings available.\n2. Define a predicate `wings_per_person` that calculates the number of wings each person would receive by dividing the total wings by the number of friends.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and calculate the result.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_wings(TotalWings) :- \n    InitialWings = 8,\n    AdditionalWings = 10,\n    TotalWings is InitialWings + AdditionalWings.\n\nwings_per_person(WingsPerPerson) :- \n    total_wings(TotalWings),\n    Friends = 3,\n    WingsPerPerson is TotalWings // Friends.\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) to calculate the number of wings each person would receive, ensuring that only whole numbers of wings are distributed.

Define a predicate `remaining_flour_needed(BrowniesBaked, TotalBrowniesNeeded, FlourPerBrownie, RemainingFlour)` that calculates the remaining flour needed.\n2. Calculate the total flour used for the brownies baked by multiplying `BrowniesBaked` by `FlourPerBrownie`.\n3. Calculate the total flour needed for all brownies by multiplying `TotalBrowniesNeeded` by `FlourPerBrownie`.\n4. Calculate the remaining flour needed by finding the difference between the total flour needed and the flour already used.\n5. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's a sample Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining flour needed\nremaining_flour_needed(BrowniesBaked, TotalBrowniesNeeded, FlourPerBrownie, RemainingFlour) :-\n    TotalFlourUsed is BrowniesBaked * FlourPerBrownie,\n    TotalFlourNeeded is TotalBrowniesNeeded * FlourPerBrownie,\n    RemainingFlour is TotalFlourNeeded - TotalFlourUsed.\n\n% Query to find the remaining flour needed\n% ?- remaining_flour_needed(5, 11, 7, RemainingFlour).\n% This query will calculate and output the remaining flour needed.\n```\n\nBy following this plan and implementing the Prolog code, we can accurately determine the amount of flour Zoe still needs to bake the remaining brownies for her party.",

Calculate the total number of lives that the players who quit had: 8 players * 6 lives/player = 48 lives.\n2. Since these 48 lives were distributed among the players who left, this represents the total number of lives that were lost when the 8 players quit the game.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, the cost of meals at the restaurant is $2 per adult meal, and kids eat for free. A group of 9 people, including 2 kids, is dining at the restaurant. To determine the total cost for the group to eat, we need to calculate the cost based on the number of adults in the group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Each adult meal costs $2, and kids eat for free.\n2. The group consists of 9 people, with 2 of them being kids.\n3. The cost for the group to eat will be based on the number of adult meals consumed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo calculate the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a rule in SWI-Prolog to calculate the total cost based on the number of adults in the group.\n2. Determine the number of adults in the group by subtracting the number of kids from the total group size.\n3. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear rules and arithmetic operations, we can efficiently determine the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\nHere is a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet that implements the plan outlined above:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total cost for the group to eat\ntotal_cost(GroupSize, Cost) :-\n    NumAdults is GroupSize - 2,  % Subtract 2 kids from the total group size to get the number of adults\n    Cost is NumAdults * 2.       % Calculate the total cost based on the number of adults\n\n% Query to find the total cost for the group of 9 people with 2 kids\n% ?- total_cost(9, Cost).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule `total_cost` that calculates the total cost for the group to eat based on the number of adults in the group.

        "question": "Nancy was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 52 seeds and planted 28 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Nancy have?",

She planted 28 seeds in the big garden and distributed the remaining seeds equally among her small gardens, with 4 seeds in each small garden. The task is to determine how many small gardens Nancy had based on the information provided.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the big garden by subtracting the seeds planted in the small gardens from the total seeds Nancy started with.\n2. Determine the number of seeds planted in the small gardens by multiplying the number of small gardens by the seeds planted in each small garden.\n3. Calculate the number of small gardens by dividing the total seeds planted in the small gardens by the seeds planted in each small garden.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of the number of small gardens Nancy had based on the given information. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_seeds_planted(BigGardenSeeds, SmallGardenSeeds, TotalSeeds)` which calculates the total number of seeds planted in both the big garden and the small gardens. This rule will take the number of seeds planted in the big garden and the small gardens as input and output the total seeds planted.\n   \n2.

Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (BigGardenSeeds as 28 and SeedsPerSmallGarden as 4) and use them to compute the number of small gardens Nancy had.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `SmallGardens` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define total seeds planted\ntotal_seeds_planted(BigGardenSeeds, SmallGardenSeeds, TotalSeeds) :-\n    TotalSeeds is BigGardenSeeds + SmallGardenSeeds.\n\n% Define number of small gardens\nnumber_of_small_gardens(TotalSeeds, SeedsPerSmallGarden, SmallGardens) :-\n    SmallGardens is TotalSeeds // SeedsPerSmallGarden.\n\n% Sample query to find the number of small gardens\n% ?- total_seeds_planted(28, 52 - 28, TotalSeeds), number_of_small_gardens(TotalSeeds, 4, SmallGardens).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total seeds planted and then calculates the number of small gardens Nancy had based on the given information.
