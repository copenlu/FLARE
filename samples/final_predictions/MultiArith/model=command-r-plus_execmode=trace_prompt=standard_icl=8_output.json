After accumulating his earnings for four weeks, he makes two sequential purchases: first, he spends half of his total savings on a video game, and then he spends a quarter of the remaining amount on a book. The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget.

Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (ShoesCost as $50 and DressCost as $200) and use them to compute the desired budget for Rachel.\n\n4.

Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `dog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears)` that takes the brother's age in six years and computes the dog's age in six years.\n2. Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the age of Tom's dog in six years based on the given conditions."

The task is to calculate the total cost of the meal and then determine how much each friend must pay if the bill is split equally among them. The items ordered include a Taco Salad, Dave's Single hamburgers, sets of french fries, and cups of peach lemonade, each with specific costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much each friend pays, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each item:\n   - Taco Salad: $10\n   - Dave's Single hamburgers: 5 orders at $5 each = $25\n   - French fries: 4 sets at $2.50 each = $10\n   - Peach lemonade: 5 cups at $2 each = $10\n\n2. Sum up these costs to get the total bill:\n   - Total bill = $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (Hamburgers) + $10 (Fries) + $10 (Lemonade) = $55\n\n3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend pays:\n   - Each friend pays = Total bill / 5\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_bill\" that takes variables for each item's cost and the number of friends.\n2. Assign constants to the costs of individual items (e.g., cost of Taco Salad, cost of a hamburger).\n3. Compute the total cost for each type of item by multiplying the unit cost with the quantity ordered.\n4. Sum up all these total costs to get the final bill.\n5. Divide the final bill by the number of friends to determine how much each friend pays.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define costs of items\nitem_cost(taco_salad, 10).\nitem_cost(hamburger, 5).\nitem_cost(fries, 2.5).\nitem_cost(lemonade, 2).\n\n% Calculate total cost of an item type\ntotal_item_cost(Item, Quantity, TotalCost) :-\n    item_cost(Item, CostPerItem),\n    TotalCost is CostPerItem * Quantity.\n\n% Calculate the total bill and how much each friend pays\ncalculate_bill(NumFriends, EachPays) :-\n    total_item_cost(taco_salad, 1, TotalTacoSalad),\n    total_item_cost(hamburger, 5, TotalHamburgers),\n    total_item_cost(fries, 4, TotalFries),\n    total_item_cost(lemonade, 5, TotalLemonade),\n    TotalBill is TotalTacoSalad + TotalHamburgers + TotalFries + TotalLemonade,\n    EachPays is TotalBill / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost of each item, calculates the total cost for each type of item based on the quantity, sums these to get the total bill, and finally computes the amount each friend pays by dividing the total bill by the number of friends."

The blue weights each weigh 2 pounds, and the green weights each weigh 3 pounds. He uses 4 blue weights and 5 green weights. Additionally, the bar itself has a weight of 2 pounds. To find the total weight of the bar with the weights, we need to calculate the weight contributed by each color of weight and add it to the bar's weight.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by calculating the total weight for each type of weight and then adding these weights together along with the bar's weight:\n1. Calculate the total weight of the blue weights: Number of blue weights multiplied by the weight of each blue weight.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the green weights: Number of green weights multiplied by the weight of each green weight.\n3. Add the weights of the blue and green weights to the weight of the bar to get the total weight.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total weight based on the given input of the number of each type of weight and the weight of the bar. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_weight` that takes five parameters: the number of blue weights (`NumBlue`), the number of green weights (`NumGreen`), the weight of each blue weight (`WeightBlue`), the weight of each green weight (`WeightGreen`), and the weight of the bar (`WeightBar`).\n2. Calculate the total weight contributed by the blue weights as `NumBlue * WeightBlue`.\n3. Calculate the total weight contributed by the green weights as `NumGreen * WeightGreen`.\n4. Sum the weights from the blue weights, green weights, and the bar to get the `TotalWeight`.\n5. Use swi-prolog's ability to perform arithmetic operations and unify the result with `TotalWeight`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total weight\ntotal_weight(NumBlue, NumGreen, WeightBlue, WeightGreen, WeightBar, TotalWeight) :-\n    TotalBlueWeight is NumBlue * WeightBlue,\n    TotalGreenWeight is NumGreen * WeightGreen,\n    TotalWeight is TotalBlueWeight + TotalGreenWeight + WeightBar.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total weight\n% ?- total_weight(4, 5, 2, 3, 2, TotalWeight).\n% This should output the total weight with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total weight of Harry's custom weight bar setup using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing the power of Prolog in handling mathematical tasks through logical rules."

                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nAlec is aiming to secure three-quarters of the votes from his class of 60 students to ensure a win in the election for Class President. He has already received commitments from half the class and is working to persuade additional voters. The task involves calculating the total number of votes Alec has secured and determining how many additional votes he needs to reach his goal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Votes Required**: Alec needs three-quarters of the total class votes.\n   - Total class size = 60\n   - Required votes = 3/4 of 60 = 45 votes\n\n2. **Current Votes Secured**: Half of the class has already agreed to vote for Alec.\n   - Votes from half the class = 1/2 of 60 = 30 votes\n\n3. **Additional Votes from Undecided Students**: Out of the remaining students, only 5 were considering voting for him initially. After further campaigning, a fifth of the remaining students (who were not already considering him) decided to vote for him.\n   - Remaining students after 30 commitments = 60 - 30 = 30 students\n   - Initially undecided but considering = 5\n   - Remaining students not considering Alec initially = 30 - 5 = 25\n   - Additional votes after campaigning = 1/5 of 25 = 5 votes\n\n4. **Total Votes After Campaigning**: Sum of votes from committed and persuaded students.\n   - Total votes after initial and additional campaigning = 30 (initially committed) + 5 (initially undecided) + 5 (converted from non-considering) = 40 votes\n\n5. **Votes Needed to Reach Goal**: Subtract the total votes Alec has from the required votes.\n   - Additional votes needed = 45 (goal) - 40 (current) = 5 votes\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how many more votes Alec needs based on the input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_students/1` to hold the total number of students.\n   - `votes_required/2` to calculate the number of votes needed to win.\n   - `initial_votes/2` to calculate the votes Alec initially secured.\n   - `undecided_votes/2` to calculate the votes from students initially undecided.\n   - `additional_campaign_votes/3` to calculate the additional votes from non-considering students after campaigning.\n   - `total_current_votes/2` to sum up all votes Alec has after campaigning.\n   - `votes_needed/3` to calculate how many more votes Alec needs to reach his goal.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of students and check if the output matches the expected number of additional votes needed (5 votes).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values."

Each video game costs $45, and each book costs $5. By the end of the summer, Kenny has mowed 35 lawns and wants to buy 5 video games. We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently."

They indulged in some of their treats on the first night, eating 35 pieces altogether.

Calculate the total number of candies they had at the beginning by adding up Debby's candies and her sister's candies:\n   - Total candies = Debby's candies + Sister's candies\n2. Determine the number of candies they have left by subtracting the number of candies they ate from the total:\n   - Candies left = Total candies - Candies eaten\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of candies they have left. Our plan will involve creating a rule that computes the initial total, takes into account the candies they ate, and then calculates the remaining candies.\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_total_candies(DebbyCandies, SisterCandies, TotalCandies)` that calculates the total number of candies they have at the beginning.\n2. Define a predicate `candies_left(TotalCandies, CandiesEaten, RemainingCandies)` that calculates the number of candies they have left after eating some.\n3.

Test the predicates with the given values:\n   - For the initial total, query `initial_total_candies(32, 42, TotalCandies)`.\n   - For the candies left, query `candies_left(TotalCandies, 35, RemainingCandies)`.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_total_candies(DebbyCandies, SisterCandies, TotalCandies) :-\n    TotalCandies is DebbyCandies + SisterCandies.\n\ncandies_left(TotalCandies, CandiesEaten, RemainingCandies) :-\n    RemainingCandies is TotalCandies - CandiesEaten.\n\nhalloween_candies(DebbyCandies, SisterCandies, CandiesEaten, RemainingCandies) :-\n    initial_total_candies(DebbyCandies, SisterCandies, TotalCandies),\n    candies_left(TotalCandies, CandiesEaten, RemainingCandies).\n```\n\nThis plan sets up the predicates to calculate the initial total candies and the candies left after eating some.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA pet store initially had a certain number of Siamese cats and house cats. During a sale, some cats were sold, and now we want to determine how many cats are left in the store. This problem involves basic subtraction and logical reasoning to find the remaining number of cats.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the initial state: There were 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats in the store.\n2. Determine the change: During the sale, 10 cats were sold.\n3. Calculate the final state: Subtract the number of cats sold from the initial count to find out how many cats are left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of cats left after the sale based on the initial counts and the number of cats sold. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_cats(Siamese, House)` to represent the initial number of Siamese and house cats.\n2. Define a predicate `cats_sold(NumSold)` to represent the number of cats sold during the sale.\n3. Define a predicate `cats_left(SiameseLeft, HouseLeft)` to calculate the number of Siamese and house cats left after the sale.\n4. Implement the predicates:\n   - For `initial_cats/2`, use the facts: `initial_cats(13, 5).`\n   - For `cats_sold/1`, use the fact: `cats_sold(10).`\n   - For `cats_left/2`, calculate `SiameseLeft` and `HouseLeft` based on the initial counts and the number sold.\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe school cafeteria ordered a total of 42 red apples and 7 green apples for student lunches. However, only 9 students wanted fruit. To determine how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to calculate the total number of apples wanted by the students and then compare it to the number of apples ordered.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples ordered: 42 red apples + 7 green apples.\n2. Determine the number of apples wanted by the students: 9 students * 1 apple each.\n3. Find the difference between the total apples ordered and the number of apples wanted to identify the excess.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of extra apples. Our plan will involve creating predicates for each step of the analysis:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_ordered(RedApples, GreenApples, TotalOrdered)` to calculate the sum of red and green apples ordered.\n2. Define a predicate `apples_wanted(NumStudents, ApplesWanted)` to compute the number of apples wanted by the students (assuming each student wants one apple).\n3. Define a predicate `extra_apples(TotalOrdered, ApplesWanted, ExtraApples)` to find the difference between the total ordered and the number wanted, resulting in the excess apples.\n4. Implement the predicates using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference:\n   - For `total_ordered/3`, use addition to calculate `TotalOrdered`.\n   - For `apples_wanted/2`, multiply `NumStudents` by 1 to get `ApplesWanted`.\n   - For `extra_apples/3`, subtract `ApplesWanted` from `TotalOrdered` to determine `ExtraApples`.\n5.

To find out how many shirts he left unwashed, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of shirts and the number he managed to wash.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Understand the given information**:\n   - Ned had 9 short sleeve shirts to wash.\n   - He also had 21 long sleeve shirts to wash.\n   - By the time school started, he had washed 29 shirts in total.\n2. **Calculate the total number of shirts**:\n   - Add the number of short sleeve shirts and long sleeve shirts to find the total: 9 shirts + 21 shirts = 30 shirts.\n3. **Determine the number of unwashed shirts**:\n   - Subtract the number of shirts he washed (29) from the total number of shirts (30) to find out how many shirts he left unwashed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the number of unwashed shirts based on the input values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_shirts(ShortShirts, LongShirts, TotalShirts)` to calculate the total number of shirts by summing the short and long sleeve shirts.\n   - `washed_shirts(TotalShirts, WashedCount)` to specify the number of shirts Ned managed to wash.\n   - `unwashed_shirts(TotalShirts, WashedCount, UnwashedCount)` to calculate the number of shirts Ned did not wash.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Define rules to relate the input values to the desired output.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the known values for short sleeve shirts, long sleeve shirts, and washed shirts to determine the number of unwashed shirts.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_shirts(ShortShirts, LongShirts, TotalShirts) :-\n    TotalShirts is ShortShirts + LongShirts.\n\nwashed_shirts(TotalShirts, WashedCount) :-\n    % Define the number of shirts Ned washed\n\nunwashed_shirts(TotalShirts, WashedCount, UnwashedCount) :-\n    UnwashedCount is TotalShirts - WashedCount.\n\nunwashed_count(ShortShirts, LongShirts, WashedCount, UnwashedCount) :-\n    total_shirts(ShortShirts, LongShirts, TotalShirts),\n    washed_shirts(TotalShirts, WashedCount),\n    unwashed_shirts(TotalShirts, WashedCount, UnwashedCount).\n```\n\nThis plan sets up the predicates to calculate the total number of shirts, the number of washed shirts, and finally the number of unwashed shirts.

        "question": "Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 11 games from a friend and bought 22 more at a garage sale. If 19 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNed is expanding his game collection by purchasing games from a friend and at a garage sale. He buys a total of 11 games from his friend and an additional 22 games at the garage sale. Unfortunately, some of the games he acquired are not functional, with 19 of them not working. The problem asks us to calculate the number of working or \"good\" games Ned ended up with after these purchases.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of good games Ned acquired, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Total Games Purchased**: Calculate the sum of games bought from the friend and at the garage sale: 11 + 22 = 33 games.\n2. **Non-Working Games**: There are 19 games that do not work.\n3. **Good Games**: Subtract the number of non-working games from the total games purchased: 33 - 19 = 14 good games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of good games Ned acquired. Our plan will involve creating predicates for each step of the analysis:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_games(FriendGames, GarageSaleGames, TotalGames)` to calculate the sum of games bought from the friend and at the garage sale.\n   - `non_working_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames)` to determine the number of games that don't work.\n   - `good_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames)` to calculate the number of good games Ned acquired.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Define rules to relate the inputs and outputs of each predicate based on the analysis.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the known values for games bought from the friend and at the garage sale, and the number of non-working games.\n   - Query the `good_games` predicate to obtain the number of good games Ned ended up with.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with these predicates, we can efficiently compute the number of good games Ned acquired, leveraging Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.\n\nHere's a possible outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_games(FriendGames, GarageSaleGames, TotalGames) :- TotalGames is FriendGames + GarageSaleGames.\n\nnon_working_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames) :- NonWorkingGames is TotalGames - GoodGames.\n\ngood_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames) :- GoodGames is TotalGames - NonWorkingGames.\n\ngame_collection(FriendGames, GarageSaleGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames) :-\n    total_games(FriendGames, GarageSaleGames, TotalGames),\n    non_working_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames),\n    good_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames).\n\n% Example query\n% ?- game_collection(11, 22, 19, GoodGames).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem, and the query will return the number of good games Ned acquired.",

Calculate the total number of tickets won: 32 tickets (from 'whack a mole') + 25 tickets (from 'skee ball') = 57 tickets.\n2. Subtract the number of tickets Tom spent on the hat: 57 tickets - 7 tickets = 50 tickets remaining.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the number of tickets Tom has left after spending some on a hat.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJanet and her sister combined their Halloween candy, resulting in a total of 34 pieces for Janet and 33 pieces for her sister. On the first night, they indulged in some of their treats, eating 4 pieces altogether. To find out how many pieces they have left, we need to calculate the initial combined total and then subtract the number of pieces they ate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of candy pieces they had initially by adding up Janet's and her sister's candy: 34 pieces + 33 pieces = 67 pieces.\n2. Determine the number of candy pieces they have left after eating 4 pieces on the first night: 67 pieces - 4 pieces = 63 pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of candy pieces left based on the initial amounts and the number of pieces eaten. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_total_candy(JanetCandy, SisterCandy, TotalCandy)` that calculates the total number of candy pieces they had initially.\n2.

To find out how many new books he bought, we need to determine the number of new books within these two categories. This problem involves basic arithmetic and logical reasoning to calculate the number of new books in each category and then sum them up to find the total new books purchased.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of books bought: 13 (adventure) + 17 (mystery) = 30 books.\n2. Since we know that 15 books were used, the remaining books must be new: 30 books - 15 used books = 15 new books.\n3. Alternatively, we can calculate the number of new books in each category:\n   - New adventure books = Total adventure books - Used adventure books\n   - New mystery books = Total mystery books - Used mystery books\n   - Sum these values to get the total new books.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules to calculate the number of new books based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule \"new_books\" that takes the total number of adventure and mystery books bought, as well as the number of used books, and calculates the number of new books.\n2.

To determine how much money Oliver has now, we need to calculate the net change in his savings by considering both the addition of the birthday money and the subtraction of the money spent on the game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by performing the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total amount Oliver has after receiving the birthday money: Initial amount + Birthday money.\n2. Deduct the amount he spent on the game from the total amount.\n3. The final result will be the amount of money Oliver has now.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates Oliver's current savings based on his initial amount, the birthday money he received, and the amount he spent on the game. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Define a predicate `initial_savings(InitialAmount)` to represent Oliver's savings before receiving the birthday money.\n2. Define a predicate `birthday_money_received(AmountReceived)` to represent the additional money Oliver got for his birthday.\n3. Define a predicate `money_spent_on_game(AmountSpent)` to represent the amount Oliver spent on the new game.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVanessa and her mom went carrot picking in their garden and collected a total of 31 carrots, with Vanessa picking 17 and her mother picking 14. However, out of their collective harvest, only 24 carrots were deemed good. The task is to determine how many bad carrots they ended up with.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of bad carrots, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of carrots picked and the number of good carrots:\n\n- Total carrots picked = 17 (picked by Vanessa) + 14 (picked by her mom) = 31\n- Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of bad carrots based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `bad_carrots(VanessaCarrots, MomCarrots, GoodCarrots, BadCarrots)` that relates the number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom to the number of good carrots and the number of bad carrots.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the total number of carrots picked: `TotalCarrots is VanessaCarrots + MomCarrots.`\n3. Calculate the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total carrots picked: `BadCarrots is TotalCarrots - GoodCarrots.`\n4. Define the predicates with the given values from the problem: `vanessa_carrots(VanessaCarrots).` and `mom_carrots(MomCarrots).`\n5. Query the `bad_carrots` predicate with the known values to find the number of bad carrots: `?- bad_carrots(17, 14, 24, BadCarrots).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating bad carrots\nbad_carrots(vanessa_carrots(VC), mom_carrots(MC), good_carrots(GC), bad_carrots(BC)) :-\n    total_carrots(VC, MC, TC),\n    bad_carrots_calc(TC, GC, BC).\n\n% Calculate the total number of carrots\ntotal_carrots(VC, MC, TC) :- TC is VC + MC.\n\n% Calculate the number of bad carrots\nbad_carrots_calc(TC, GC, BC) :- BC is TC - GC.\n\n% Example queries\n?- bad_carrots(17, 14, 24, BC).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships between the number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom, the number of good carrots, and the number of bad carrots.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJanet picked a certain number of tulips and roses to create flower bouquets. Specifically, she picked 4 tulips and 11 roses. However, she only ended up using 11 flowers in total for her bouquets. The question is, how many extra flowers did Janet pick?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of extra flowers Janet picked, we need to compare the total number of flowers she picked with the number she actually used. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Total flowers picked: 4 tulips + 11 roses.\n2. Total flowers used: 11 (given in the question).\n3. Calculate the difference between the total flowers picked and the total flowers used to find the extra flowers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of extra flowers based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule \"extra_flowers\" that takes into account the number of tulips and roses picked, as well as the total flowers used.\n2. Calculate the total number of flowers picked by summing up the number of tulips and roses.\n3. Compare the total number of flowers picked with the number of flowers used to determine the extra flowers.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and comparisons.\n\nHere's a possible SWI-Prolog code outline:\n\n```prolog\nextra_flowers(tulipsPicked, rosesPicked, flowersUsed, extraFlowers) :-\n    total_flowers_picked(tulipsPicked, rosesPicked, TotalPicked),\n    extraFlowers is TotalPicked - flowersUsed.\n\ntotal_flowers_picked(Tulips, Roses, Total) :-\n    Total is Tulips + Roses.\n```\n\nIn this plan, we first define a rule \"extra_flowers\" that takes the number of tulips and roses picked and the total number of flowers used. We then define another rule \"total_flowers_picked\" to calculate the sum of tulips and roses.

We assert that the sum of tulips and roses is 11, and that the number of flowers used is also 11. By running this code, SWI-Prolog will infer that the number of extra flowers is 0, indicating that Janet picked exactly the number of flowers she needed for her bouquets.",

She then deletes some files, specifically 10 files in total. The task is to determine how many files remain on her flash drive after the deletion.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the initial number of files of each type and then account for the deletion of 10 files. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of music and video files:\n   - Music files: 13\n   - Video files: 30\n2. Determine the number of files deleted:\n   - Deleted files: 10\n3. Calculate the remaining number of files by subtracting the deleted files from the initial counts:\n   - Remaining music files = Initial music files - Deleted files\n   - Remaining video files = Initial video files - Deleted files\n4. Sum the remaining music and video files to find the total number of files still on the flash drive.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to represent the initial file counts, the deletion, and the calculation of remaining files.

        "question": "While shopping, Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels. If she gave her mother 34 of them, how many towels did Maria end up with?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMaria went shopping and purchased a total of fifty-six towels, consisting of thirty-five green towels and twenty-one white towels. She then gave away a significant portion of these towels, specifically thirty-four towels, to her mother. The objective is to determine the number of towels that Maria retains after this generous act.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many towels Maria has left, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Identify the initial quantities: Maria started with 35 green towels and 21 white towels, resulting in a total of 56 towels.\n2. Understand the transaction: Maria gave 34 towels to her mother.\n3. Calculate the remaining towels: Subtract the number of towels given to her mother from the initial total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n1. Define a predicate `initial_towels(Green, White, Total)` to represent the initial quantities of green and white towels Maria bought.\n2. Define a predicate `given_to_mother(TotalGiven)` to represent the number of towels Maria gave to her mother.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_towels(TotalRemaining)` to calculate and represent the number of towels Maria has left after giving some to her mother.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - Calculate `TotalRemaining` by subtracting `TotalGiven` from the initial `Total`.\n5. Define the predicates with the specific values provided in the problem:\n   - `initial_towels(35, 21, Total).`\n   - `given_to_mother(34).`\n6. Query SWI-Prolog to find out the value of `TotalRemaining`, which represents the number of towels Maria has left:\n   - `?- remaining_towels(TotalRemaining).`\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog, utilizing its arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations and logical inference to relate the initial quantities, towels given, and remaining towels.",

Identify the total number of apples ordered: 6 red apples + 15 green apples.\n2. Calculate the total number of apples wanted by the five students.\n3. Find the difference between the total apples ordered and the total apples wanted to determine the excess or shortage.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the number of extra apples. \n\n1. Define a predicate `total_ordered(RedApples, GreenApples, TotalOrdered)` that calculates the total number of apples ordered.\n2. Define a predicate `apples_per_student(Students, ApplesPerStudent)` that calculates the number of apples each student wants.\n3. Define a predicate `total_wanted(Students, TotalWanted)` that calculates the total number of apples wanted by the students.\n4. Define a predicate `extra_apples(TotalOrdered, TotalWanted, ExtraApples)` that calculates the number of extra apples by subtracting the total wanted from the total ordered.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations and logical inference to relate the predicates.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_ordered(RedApples, GreenApples, TotalOrdered) :-\n    TotalOrdered is RedApples + GreenApples.\n\napples_per_student(_, 1).\n\ntotal_wanted(Students, TotalWanted) :-\n    apples_per_student(Students, ApplesPerStudent),\n    TotalWanted is Students * ApplesPerStudent.\n\nextra_apples(TotalOrdered, TotalWanted, ExtraApples) :-\n    TotalOrdered > TotalWanted,\n    ExtraApples is TotalOrdered - TotalWanted.\n\ncafeteria_apples(RedApples, GreenApples, Students, ExtraApples) :-\n    total_ordered(RedApples, GreenApples, TotalOrdered),\n    total_wanted(Students, TotalWanted),\n    extra_apples(TotalOrdered, TotalWanted, ExtraApples).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships between the number of apples ordered, the number of students wanting fruit, and the resulting extra apples. The `extra_apples` predicate ensures that we only calculate extra apples if the total ordered is greater than the total wanted. This approach leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to solve the problem efficiently.",

However, she only ended up using 81 flowers in total for her bouquets. The problem asks us to determine how many extra flowers Bianca picked.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many extra flowers Bianca picked, we need to compare the total number of flowers she picked (tulips plus roses) with the number of flowers she actually used. The difference between these two quantities will give us the excess or extra flowers she had.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the number of tulips, roses, and used flowers.

        "question": "Haley had 27 music files and 42 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 11 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley had a collection of music and video files on her flash drive. Initially, she had 27 music files and 42 video files. She then deleted some files, specifically 11 of them. The task is to determine how many files remain on her flash drive after this deletion.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many files are still on Haley's flash drive, we need to subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of files she initially had:\n\n- Total initial files = 27 music files + 42 video files = 69 files\n- Deleted files = 11 files\n- Remaining files = Initial files - Deleted files = 69 files - 11 files\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of remaining files based on the initial count and the number of deleted files. Here's the outline for the code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_files(MusicFiles, VideoFiles, TotalFiles)` that relates the number of music files, video files, and the total files initially present on the flash drive.\n2. Define a predicate `deleted_files(NumDeleted, RemainingFiles)` that calculates the number of remaining files after deleting a certain number of files.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the subtraction: `RemainingFiles is TotalFiles - NumDeleted.`\n4. Define the initial file counts and the number of deleted files as constants in the predicates.\n5. Query the `deleted_files` predicate to find out how many files are still on the flash drive.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_files(27, 42, TotalFiles) :- TotalFiles is 27 + 42.\n\ndeleted_files(NumDeleted, RemainingFiles, TotalFiles) :-\n    RemainingFiles is TotalFiles - NumDeleted.\n\nhaley_files(RemainingFiles) :-\n    initial_files(MusicFiles, VideoFiles, TotalFiles),\n    deleted_files(11, RemainingFiles, TotalFiles).\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define the initial file counts and calculate the total initial files. Then, we define the number of deleted files and compute the remaining files. Finally, we query the `haley_files` predicate to find out how many files are left on Haley's flash drive after deleting 11 files. This approach uses Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical inference to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKatie and her sister combined their Halloween candy, resulting in a total of 8 + 23 = 31 pieces of candy. On the first night, they indulged in and ate 8 pieces. To find out how many pieces they have left, we simply subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total combined candy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves basic arithmetic operations: addition to find the total combined candy and subtraction to determine the remaining candy after eating some. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Total Combined Candy**: Katie had 8, and her sister had 23, so together they have 8 + 23 = 31 pieces.\n2. **Candy Eaten**: They ate 8 pieces on the first night.\n3. **Candy Left**: To find out how many pieces they have left, we subtract the candy eaten from the total combined candy: 31 - 8 = 23.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining candy based on the initial amounts and the number eaten. Here's a structured plan:\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_candy(katie, 8)` to represent Katie's initial candy.\n   - `initial_candy(sister, 23)` to represent her sister's initial candy.\n   - `candy_eaten(PiecesEaten)` to represent the number of pieces eaten on the first night.\n2. **Calculate Combined Candy**:\n   - Define a rule `combined_candy(KatieCandy, SisterCandy, TotalCandy)` to calculate the total combined candy by summing Katie's and her sister's candy.\n3. **Calculate Remaining Candy**:\n   - Define a rule `remaining_candy(TotalCandy, PiecesEaten, RemainingPieces)` to calculate the remaining candy after subtracting the eaten pieces from the total combined candy.\n4. **Query the Solution**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the remaining pieces of candy by providing the initial candy amounts and the number of pieces eaten.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_candy(katie, 8).\ninitial_candy(sister, 23).\n\ncombined_candy(KatieCandy, SisterCandy, TotalCandy) :-\n    initial_candy(katie, KC),\n    initial_candy(sister, SC),\n    TotalCandy is KC + SC.\n\nremaining_candy(TotalCandy, PiecesEaten, RemainingPieces) :-\n    TotalCandy >= PiecesEaten,\n    RemainingPieces is TotalCandy - PiecesEaten.\n\n% Query the solution\nremaining_pieces(RemainingPieces) :-\n    initial_candy(katie, KC),\n    initial_candy(sister, SC),\n    combined_candy(KC, SC, Total),\n    candy_eaten(PiecesEaten),\n    remaining_candy(Total, PiecesEaten, RemainingPieces).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the initial candy amounts, calculates the combined candy, determines the remaining candy after eating some pieces, and finally queries the solution using the provided facts and rules.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThis problem involves tracking the change in the number of students in a fourth-grade class over the course of a year. Initially, there were 10 students. During the year, there were two types of changes: some students left, and new students joined. Specifically, 4 students left, and 42 new students came to the school. The task is to calculate the final count of students in the fourth-grade class at the end of the year.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of students in the fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to consider the initial count of students and the changes that occurred during the year:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: There were 10 students in the fourth grade at the beginning of the year.\n2. **Students Left**: During the year, 4 students left the class, decreasing the count.\n3. **New Students**: Simultaneously, 42 new students joined the fourth grade, increasing the count.\n4. **Final Count**: To find the number of students at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the initial count and then add the number of new students.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1.

She made progress by grading four of them, but then the workload increased as eighteen more worksheets were turned in. To find out how many worksheets she has left to grade, we need to calculate the net change in the number of worksheets after considering the graded worksheets and the new submissions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of worksheets the teacher has to grade, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The teacher started with 6 worksheets.\n2. She graded 4 of them, so there are 6 - 4 = 2 left from the initial stack.\n3. Then, 18 more worksheets were turned in, resulting in a total of 2 + 18 = 20 worksheets.\n4. Therefore, the teacher has 20 - 4 = 16 worksheets left to grade.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of worksheets the teacher has to grade based on the given information.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves tracking the number of books in a bargain bin at a bookstore. Initially, there were 41 books in the bin. After selling some books and adding more, we need to determine the final count of books in the bin. The bookstore sold 33 books and then added 2 more books to the bin. The task is to find out how many books are left in the bin after these transactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the initial count of books, the number of books sold, and the number of books added back to the bin:\n1. **Initial State**: There were 41 books in the bin.\n2. **Transaction 1**: The bookstore sold 33 books, reducing the count in the bin.\n3. **Transaction 2**: Two more books are added to the bin.\n4. **Final State**: We need to calculate the final count of books in the bin after these transactions.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n**Predicates**:\n- Define a predicate `initial_books(Count)` to represent the initial count of books in the bin.\n- Define a predicate `books_sold(CountSold)` to represent the number of books sold.\n- Define a predicate `books_added(CountAdded)` to represent the number of books added back to the bin.\n- Define a predicate `final_books(CountLeft)` to calculate and represent the final count of books left in the bin.\n\n**Arithmetic Operations**:\n- Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform subtraction and addition for the transactions.\n\n**Code Structure**:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_books(41).\n\nbooks_sold(CountSold) :- CountSold is 33.\n\nbooks_added(CountAdded) :- CountAdded is 2.\n\nfinal_books(CountLeft) :-\n    initial_books(Initial),\n    books_sold(Sold),\n    books_added(Added),\n    CountLeft is Initial - Sold + Added.\n```\n\n**Testing**:\n\nTo test the solution, we can query the `final_books` predicate to find out how many books are left in the bin after the transactions:\n\n```prolog\n?- final_books(CountLeft).\n```\n\nThis query should yield `CountLeft` as 10, indicating that there are 10 books left in the bin after selling 33 and adding 2 back.",

We can break it down into the following steps:\n1. **Initial Customer Count**: The waiter starts with 47 customers.\n2. **Customers Leaving**: 41 customers depart, reducing the count.\n3. **New Customers**: The waiter gains 20 new customers.\n4. **Final Customer Count**: To find the final number of customers, subtract the customers who left from the initial count and then add the new customers: \n   - **Final Count = Initial Count - Customers Leaving + New Customers**\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure the code as follows:\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate `initial_customers(Count)` to represent the initial number of customers (47).\n   - Define a predicate `customers_left(Count)` to represent the number of customers who left (41).\n   - Define a predicate `new_customers(Count)` to represent the number of new customers (20).\n   - Define a predicate `final_customers(Count)` to calculate the final number of customers after the changes.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations:\n     - Subtract the number of customers who left from the initial count.\n     - Add the number of new customers to the result of the previous step.\n3. **Rule Definition**:\n   - Create a rule `customer_count(FinalCount)` that uses the defined predicates to calculate the final customer count:\n     - `customer_count(FinalCount) :- initial_customers(Initial) - customers_left(Left) + new_customers(New) = FinalCount.`\n4. **Query**:\n   - Use a query to find the final customer count:\n     - `?- customer_count(FinalCount).`\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog, utilizing arithmetic operations and logical relationships to determine the final number of customers the waiter has to serve.",

This involves subtracting the number of people who left from the initial count and then adding the number of new individuals who joined:\n\n- Starting count: 30 people\n- Number of people who left: 10 people\n- Number of new people who joined: 5 people\n\nThe calculation can be expressed as: \nInitial count - Left + Joined = New count\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the new count of people in line based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `line_count(InitialCount, Left, Joined, NewCount)`:\n   - `InitialCount` represents the starting number of people in line.\n   - `Left` represents the number of people who left the line.\n   - `Joined` represents the number of new people who joined the line.\n   - `NewCount` represents the updated count of people in line.\n2. Calculate the `NewCount` by subtracting the number of people who left from the `InitialCount` and then adding the number of people who joined:\n   - `NewCount is InitialCount - Left + Joined.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculation and unify the result with `NewCount`.\n4. Query the `line_count` rule with the given values to find the new count of people in line:\n   - `?- line_count(30, 10, 5, NewCount).`\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog, utilizing its arithmetic operations and logical inference to determine the updated count of people waiting in line for the bumper cars.",

        "question": "Bianca had 45 coloring books. If she gave away 6 of them, but then bought 20 more, how many would she have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca initially had a certain number of coloring books and then underwent a series of transactions involving giving away and buying more books. The problem involves calculating the final total number of coloring books she has after these transactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of coloring books Bianca has, we need to consider the initial quantity, the number given away, and the additional books bought:\n1. Bianca started with 45 coloring books.\n2. She gave away 6 coloring books, which reduces the total by 6.\n3. Bianca then bought 20 more coloring books, increasing the total by 20.\n4. To find the final total, we add the initial quantity, subtract the number given away, and then add the number bought: \n   - Initial quantity: 45\n   - Given away: -6\n   - Bought: +20\n5. Calculate the final total by summing these values: 45 + (-6) + 20.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final total number of coloring books Bianca has. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. **Define a rule**: Create a rule named `total_coloring_books(Initial, GaveAway, Bought, Total)` that takes the initial number of coloring books, the number given away, the number bought, and computes the total.\n2. **Calculate the intermediate values**:\n   - Calculate the number of coloring books after giving some away: `AfterGivingAway is Initial - GaveAway`.\n   - Compute the final total by adding the number bought: `Total is AfterGivingAway + Bought`.\n3. **Test the rule**: Provide the initial number of books Bianca had (45), the number she gave away (6), and the number she bought (20) to calculate the `Total`.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of coloring books\ntotal_coloring_books(Initial, GaveAway, Bought, Total) :-\n    AfterGivingAway is Initial - GaveAway,\n    Total is AfterGivingAway + Bought.\n\n% Query to find the total number of coloring books Bianca has\nbianca_coloring_books(Total) :-\n    total_coloring_books(45, 6, 20, Total).\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationships and calculations needed to determine the final total number of coloring books Bianca has, demonstrating how SWI-Prolog can be used to solve basic arithmetic problems through logical inference.",

The problem requires us to calculate the final number of songs on her MP3 player after these two changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of songs Zoe has on her MP3 player, we need to consider the initial number of songs and the impact of the two actions: deleting songs and adding new ones.

Then, 9 old oranges were thrown away, and 38 new oranges were added to the bin. The task is to determine the final count of oranges in the bin after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Initial State**: There were 31 oranges in the bin.\n2. **Removal**: 9 old oranges were thrown away, so the count decreases by 9.\n3. **Addition**: 38 new oranges were added, so the count increases by 38.\n4. **Final State**: To find the total number of oranges in the bin after these changes, we add the number of oranges added and subtract the number of oranges removed from the initial count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final count of oranges in the bin based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_count(Count)` to represent the initial number of oranges in the bin (31).\n2. Define a predicate `oranges_thrown(Count, ThrownCount)` to calculate the number of oranges thrown away (9).\n3. Define a predicate `new_oranges_added(Count, AddedCount)` to calculate the number of new oranges added (38).\n4. Define a predicate `final_count(InitialCount, ThrownCount, AddedCount, FinalCount)` to compute the final count of oranges in the bin. It will take into account the initial count, the number thrown away, and the number added.\n5. Implement the predicates using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n   - `final_count(InitialCount, ThrownCount, AddedCount, FinalCount) :- FinalCount is InitialCount - ThrownCount + AddedCount.`\n6.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRachel is playing a video game and her progress is measured by the number of lives she has. Initially, she starts with 10 lives. During a challenging part of the game, she loses some lives, specifically 4 of them. However, in the next level, she gains additional lives, this time 26 more lives. The goal is to determine the total number of lives Rachel has after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many lives Rachel has after losing and gaining lives, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of lives, which is 10.\n2. Subtract the number of lives lost, which is 4.\n3. Add the number of new lives gained in the next level, which is 26.\n4. The final number of lives will be the result of these additions and subtractions.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final number of lives Rachel has based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `final_lives(InitialLives, LostLives, GainedLives, FinalLives)` that relates the initial number of lives, the number of lives lost, the number of new lives gained, and the final number of lives.\n2. Set `InitialLives` to 10 to represent the starting lives Rachel had.\n3. Set `LostLives` to 4 to indicate the number of lives she lost.\n4. Set `GainedLives` to 26 to represent the additional lives she gained in the next level.\n5. Calculate `FinalLives` by subtracting `LostLives` from `InitialLives` and then adding `GainedLives` to that result.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\nfinal_lives(InitialLives, LostLives, GainedLives, FinalLives) :-\n    FinalLives is InitialLives - LostLives + GainedLives.\n\n% Query to find the final number of lives Rachel has\nquery_lives(FinalLives) :-\n    final_lives(10, 4, 26, FinalLives).\n```\n\nThis code defines a rule `final_lives` that calculates the final number of lives based on the given parameters. The `query_lives` predicate is used to find the solution for the specific values provided in the problem.",

        "question": "A florist had 6 roses. If she sold 5 of them and then later picked 12 more, how many roses would she have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe florist initially had a certain number of roses, sold some of them, and then acquired more roses. The problem involves keeping track of these changes to determine the final number of roses the florist has.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the initial number of roses, the number sold, and the additional roses acquired. Here are the steps to find the final count:\n\n1. The florist started with 6 roses.\n2. She sold 5 roses, so the remaining number of roses is 6 - 5 = 1.\n3. After selling some roses, she picked 12 more, increasing the count to 1 + 12 = 13 roses.\n\nTherefore, the florist now has 13 roses.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final number of roses based on the initial count, the number sold, and the additional roses picked. Here's an outline for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `final_rose_count/3` that takes the initial number of roses, the number sold, and the additional roses picked as parameters.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining roses after selling by subtracting the number sold from the initial count.\n3. Compute the final rose count by adding the remaining roses and the additional roses picked.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\nfinal_rose_count(Initial, Sold, Additional, Final) :-\n    Remaining is Initial - Sold,\n    Final is Remaining + Additional.\n\n% Query with the given values\nquery_rose_count(Final) :-\n    final_rose_count(6, 5, 12, Final).\n```\n\nThis code defines a rule `final_rose_count/4` that calculates the final rose count based on the given parameters.

        "question": "Emily had 7 coloring books. If she gave away 2 of them, but then bought 14 more, how many would she have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily initially had 7 coloring books. She then gives away a portion of them (2 books) and subsequently buys more (14 books). To determine the total number of coloring books she has at the end, we need to calculate the net change in her collection. This involves subtracting the number of books she gave away from her initial count and then adding the number of books she bought.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of coloring books Emily has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of coloring books after giving away 2: Initial count - 2.\n2. Add the number of coloring books she bought (14) to the count from step 1.\n3. The result will be the total number of coloring books Emily has at the end.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final count of coloring books based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `final_count` that takes three parameters: the initial number of coloring books Emily had (`InitialCount`), the number of books she gave away (`GaveAway`), and the number of books she bought (`Bought`).\n2. Calculate the count after giving away books: `CountAfterGivingAway is InitialCount - GaveAway`.\n3. Add the number of books bought to the count from step 2: `FinalCount is CountAfterGivingAway + Bought`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and unify the result with `FinalCount`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating the final count of coloring books\nfinal_count(InitialCount, GaveAway, Bought, FinalCount) :-\n    CountAfterGivingAway is InitialCount - GaveAway,\n    FinalCount is CountAfterGivingAway + Bought.\n\n% Example query to calculate the final count\n% ?- final_count(7, 2, 14, FinalCount).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the final count of Emily's coloring books using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference.

Within the rule, perform the following calculations:\n   - Subtract the number of students who left from the initial student count.\n   - Add the number of new students who joined to the result of the previous subtraction.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and unify the result with the final student count.\n\nHere's a code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\nfinal_student_count(InitialCount, LeftCount, JoinedCount, FinalCount) :-\n    IntermediateCount is InitialCount - LeftCount,\n    FinalCount is IntermediateCount + JoinedCount.\n\nfourth_grade_students(Initial, Left, Joined, Final) :-\n    final_student_count(Initial, Left, Joined, Final).\n\n% Example query to calculate the final student count\n% ?- fourth_grade_students(8, 5, 8, FinalCount).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the final student count in the fourth-grade class by modeling the changes in student enrollment.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca's carrot-picking adventure spans two days. On the first day, she picks 23 carrots but decides to throw away 10 of them. On the second day, she adds to her collection by picking 47 more carrots. The task is to calculate the total number of carrots Bianca has at the end of these two days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of carrots Bianca has, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Start with the initial count of carrots picked on the first day: 23.\n2. Subtract the number of carrots she threw away: 23 - 10 = 13.\n3. Add the carrots she picked on the second day to the remaining count from the first day: 13 + 47.\n4. The final sum will give us the total number of carrots Bianca has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of carrots Bianca has at the end of the two days.

Define a rule named `total_carrots(Initial, ThrewAway, PickedMore, Total)` where:\n   - `Initial` is the number of carrots Bianca picked on the first day.\n   - `ThrewAway` is the number of carrots she threw away.\n   - `PickedMore` is the additional carrots she picked on the second day.\n   - `Total` is the final count of carrots she has.\n2. Calculate the remaining carrots after throwing some away: `Remaining` is `Initial` minus `ThrewAway`.\n3. Compute the `Total` by adding `Remaining` and `PickedMore`.\n4.

She drank some of them, which reduced the count, and then she bought more bottles, increasing the count again. The task is to calculate the final number of bottles she has after these two actions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many bottles Zoe has in the end, we need to perform the following steps:\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFrank initially had $11, and he spent $3 on a new game. Afterward, he received an additional $14 as allowance. To determine how much money Frank has now, we need to calculate his net gain or loss after spending and then add it to his initial amount.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves the following steps:\n1. Calculate the amount of money Frank has left after spending $3 on the game: $11 - $3 = $8.\n2. Add the additional $14 allowance to the remaining $8: $8 + $14 = $22.\n3. Frank now has a total of $22.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Frank's final amount of money based on his initial balance, spending, and additional income. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `final_amount` that takes parameters for the initial amount of money (`Initial`), the amount spent (`Spent`), and any additional income (`Income`).\n2. Calculate the remaining amount of money after spending by subtracting the spent amount from the initial amount: `RemainingAmount is Initial - Spent`.\n3. Calculate the final amount of money by adding the additional income to the remaining amount: `FinalAmount is RemainingAmount + Income`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and unify the result with `FinalAmount`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating the final amount\nfinal_amount(Initial, Spent, Income, FinalAmount) :-\n    RemainingAmount is Initial - Spent,\n    FinalAmount is RemainingAmount + Income.\n\n% Example query to calculate Frank's final amount\n% ?- final_amount(11, 3, 14, FinalAmount).\n% This should output the final amount of money Frank has.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates Frank's final amount of money using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving financial transactions and balance updates.",

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a rule** `final_ticket_count(InitialTickets, SpentTickets, AdditionalTickets, FinalTickets)` that relates the initial ticket count, the number of tickets spent, the additional tickets won, and the final ticket count.\n2. **Calculate the remaining tickets** after the beanie purchase by subtracting the spent tickets from the initial ticket count.\n3. **Add the additional tickets** won to the remaining ticket count to compute the final ticket count.\n4. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities** to perform these calculations and define the relationships between the variables.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final ticket count\nfinal_ticket_count(InitialTickets, SpentTickets, AdditionalTickets, FinalTickets) :-\n    RemainingTickets is InitialTickets - SpentTickets,\n    FinalTickets is RemainingTickets + AdditionalTickets.\n\n% Query to find the final ticket count\n% ?- final_ticket_count(11, 5, 10, FinalTickets).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the final ticket count based on the given initial ticket count, the number of tickets spent, and the additional tickets won. By querying the `final_ticket_count` predicate with the provided values, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the final number of tickets Dave has.",

Combine the two rules to calculate Roger's final book count:\n   ```prolog\n   rogers_books(InitialBooks, SoldBooks, NewBooks, TotalBooks) :-\n       books_after_selling(InitialBooks, SoldBooks, RemainingBooks),\n       books_after_buying(RemainingBooks, NewBooks, TotalBooks).\n   ```\n\n4.

Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the value of `TotalBooks`:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- rogers_books(25, 21, 30, TotalBooks).\n   ```\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to calculate Roger's book collection after selling and buying books. The rules `books_after_selling` and `books_after_buying` model the changes in Roger's book count, and the main rule `rogers_books` combines these to find the final answer.",

This predicate will use the `flower_cost` predicate to access the cost per flower.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - Calculate the cost of roses: `RosesCost is NumRoses * CostPerFlower`.\n   - Calculate the cost of daisies: `DaisiesCost is NumDaisies * CostPerFlower`.\n   - Compute the `TotalExpenditure` by summing up the costs of roses and daisies.\n4. Instantiate the predicates with the given values: `NumRoses` as 2, `NumDaisies` as 2, and `CostPerFlower` as 3.\n5. Query SWI-Prolog to compute the `TotalExpenditure` using the defined rules.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost of one flower\nflower_cost(3).\n\n% Define a rule to calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost(NumRoses, NumDaisies, TotalExpenditure) :-\n    flower_cost(CostPerFlower),\n    RosesCost is NumRoses * CostPerFlower,\n    DaisiesCost is NumDaisies * CostPerFlower,\n    TotalExpenditure is RosesCost + DaisiesCost.\n\n% Sample query to find the total expenditure\n% ?- total_cost(2, 2, TotalExpenditure).\n```\n\nThis code defines the cost of one flower and then calculates the total expenditure based on the number of roses and daisies purchased. The query at the end will compute the total amount Emily spent during her visit to the flower shop.",

        "question": "Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley purchases tickets for an upcoming concert performed by her favorite band. She buys 3 tickets for herself and her friends, and she also buys 5 extra tickets in case more of her friends want to join. Each ticket costs $4. To find out how much Haley spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of all the tickets she purchased.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the 3 tickets Haley bought for herself and her friends: 3 tickets * $4/ticket.\n2. Calculate the cost of the 5 extra tickets she purchased: 5 tickets * $4/ticket.\n3. Add the costs from the two steps above to find the total amount Haley spent on tickets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total amount Haley spent based on the number of tickets she bought and the cost per ticket. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `ticket_cost(NumTickets, CostPerTicket, TotalCost)` that computes the total cost of the tickets. It takes the number of tickets (`NumTickets`) and the cost per ticket (`CostPerTicket`) as input and calculates the `TotalCost`.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations:\n   - For the first set of tickets: `FirstSetCost is 3 * 4`.\n   - For the extra tickets: `ExtraTicketsCost is 5 * 4`.\n3. Calculate the total cost by summing the costs of both sets of tickets: `TotalCost is FirstSetCost + ExtraTicketsCost`.\n4. Define the query to find the total amount Haley spent:\n   - `?- ticket_cost(3, 4, TotalCost).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define a rule to calculate the total cost of tickets\nticket_cost(NumTickets, CostPerTicket, TotalCost) :-\n    TotalCost is NumTickets * CostPerTicket.\n\n% Query to find the total amount Haley spent\n% ?- ticket_cost(TotalTickets, CostPerTicket, TotalCost), TotalTickets is 3 + 5, CostPerTicket is 4.\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationships and calculations needed to determine the total amount Haley spent on tickets, utilizing Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical inference.",

He has the same number of piles for each type of coin, and each pile contains the same number of coins. Specifically, he has 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes, and each pile has 3 coins in it. The task is to determine the total number of coins Luke has across all these piles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of coins, we need to consider the number of piles and the number of coins in each pile for both types of coins:\n1.

Define separate predicates for quarters and dimes, each calling the `total_coins` predicate with the appropriate values:\n   - `quarters_total_coins(TotalQuarters)` calculates the total number of quarters.\n   - `dimes_total_coins(TotalDimes)` calculates the total number of dimes.\n3. Define a predicate `grand_total_coins(TotalQuarters, TotalDimes, GrandTotal)` that calculates the grand total of coins by summing the totals of quarters and dimes.\n4.

Define a rule named `total_assembly_time/3`:\n   - The first argument will represent the number of chairs.\n   - The second argument will represent the number of tables.\n   - The third argument will represent the time required to assemble each piece of furniture.\n2. Calculate the total number of furniture pieces by summing up the number of chairs and tables.\n3. Compute the total assembly time by multiplying the total number of furniture pieces by the time per piece.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_assembly_time(NumChairs, NumTables, TimePerPiece, TotalTime) :-\n    TotalFurniture is NumChairs + NumTables,\n    TotalTime is TotalFurniture * TimePerPiece.\n```\n\nTo find the solution, you can query this rule with the given values, such as `total_assembly_time(4, 4, 6, TotalTime)`, and SWI-Prolog will compute the `TotalTime` required for Wendy to assemble all the furniture. This plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.",

He has a fixed hourly rate, and we are given the number of hours he worked each day. To find his total earnings, we need to multiply his hourly rate by the total number of hours worked.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate Victor's total earnings, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Calculate daily earnings**: Multiply Victor's hourly rate ($6) by the number of hours he worked each day (5 hours). This gives us his earnings for one day.\n2. **Calculate total earnings**: Since Victor worked the same number of hours on both days, we can simply double his earnings for one day to find the total for two days. Alternatively, we can multiply his hourly rate by the total number of hours worked (2 days * 5 hours each).\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Victor's total earnings based on his hourly rate and the number of hours worked. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_earnings` that takes three parameters: `hourly_rate`, `hours_per_day`, and `days_worked`.\n2. Calculate the earnings for one day by multiplying `hourly_rate` by `hours_per_day`.\n3. Calculate the total earnings for two days by doubling the earnings for one day or by multiplying `hourly_rate` by (`days_worked` * `hours_per_day`).\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total earnings\ntotal_earnings(HourlyRate, HoursPerDay, DaysWorked, TotalEarnings) :-\n    DailyEarnings is HourlyRate * HoursPerDay,\n    TotalEarnings is DailyEarnings * DaysWorked.\n\n% Example query to calculate Victor's total earnings\n% ?- total_earnings(6, 5, 2, TotalEarnings).\n% This should output the total earnings for the two days.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates Victor's total earnings based on the given hourly rate and work hours, demonstrating how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving basic arithmetic operations and logical inference.",

The problem asks us to calculate the total number of tickets Oliver used during his time at the carnival.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to consider his rides on both attractions and the cost per ride. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Ferris Wheel Tickets**: Oliver rode the Ferris wheel five times, and each ride required seven tickets. To find the total number of tickets he used on the Ferris wheel, we multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride:\n   - Ferris Wheel Tickets = Number of Rides * Tickets per Ride\n   - Ferris Wheel Tickets = 5 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 35 tickets\n\n2. **Bumper Car Tickets**: Oliver also rode the bumper cars four times, and each ride had the same ticket cost as the Ferris wheel. To find the total number of tickets he used on the bumper cars, we apply the same calculation:\n   - Bumper Car Tickets = Number of Rides * Tickets per Ride\n   - Bumper Car Tickets = 4 rides * 7 tickets/ride = 28 tickets\n\n3. **Total Tickets Used**: To find the overall total of tickets Oliver used during his time at the carnival, we sum up the tickets used for both attractions:\n   - Total Tickets Used = Ferris Wheel Tickets + Bumper Car Tickets\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate `attraction_tickets(rides, cost_per_ride, total_tickets)` to calculate the total number of tickets used for a specific attraction.\n   - Create another predicate `total_tickets_used(ferris_rides, bumper_rides, ticket_cost, total_tickets)` to calculate the overall total tickets used based on rides on both attractions.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Implement the `attraction_tickets/3` predicate to multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride.\n   - Implement the `total_tickets_used/4` predicate to sum up the tickets used for both attractions.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the number of rides for each attraction and the cost per ride to verify the total tickets used matches the expected result.\n\nBy structuring the code with these predicates, we can clearly represent the relationships and calculations involved in the problem, making use of SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.",

        "question": "There were 5 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about the number of players in an online video game and the number of lives each player has. Initially, there were five players, and then two more joined the game. We want to calculate the total number of lives for all the players combined.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of lives, we need to multiply the number of lives per player by the total number of players. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. There were initially five players, each with 8 lives, resulting in 5 * 8 = 40 lives.\n2. Then, two more players joined, each also having 8 lives. This adds another 2 * 8 = 16 lives.\n3. To find the total number of lives, we sum up the lives from the initial players and the additional players: 40 lives + 16 lives = 56 lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the given information:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_lives(InitialPlayers, AdditionalPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives)`:\n   - `InitialPlayers` represents the number of players at the start.\n   - `AdditionalPlayers` represents the number of players who joined later.\n   - `LivesPerPlayer` is the number of lives each player has.\n   - `TotalLives` is the final sum of lives for all players.\n\n2. Implement the rule using arithmetic operations:\n   ```prolog\n   total_lives(InitialPlayers, AdditionalPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives) :-\n       TotalInitialLives is InitialPlayers * LivesPerPlayer,\n       TotalAdditionalLives is AdditionalPlayers * LivesPerPlayer,\n       TotalLives is TotalInitialLives + TotalAdditionalLives.\n   ```\n\n3. Test the rule with the given values:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- total_lives(5, 2, 8, TotalLives).\n   ```\n\n4. The output will be `TotalLives = 56`, indicating that all the players together have a total of 56 lives.\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog, utilizing arithmetic operations to compute the total number of lives based on the given inputs.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKatie sold two types of necklaces at a garage sale: bead necklaces and gemstone necklaces. She sold four bead necklaces and three gemstone necklaces, and each necklace had the same price of three dollars. The problem requires calculating the total amount of money Katie earned from these sales.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Katie earned, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total income from selling bead necklaces:\n   - Number of bead necklaces sold: 4\n   - Price per bead necklace: $3\n   - Total income from bead necklaces: Number of necklaces * Price per necklace\n\n2. Calculate the total income from selling gemstone necklaces:\n   - Number of gemstone necklaces sold: 3\n   - Price per gemstone necklace: $3\n   - Total income from gemstone necklaces: Number of necklaces * Price per necklace\n\n3. Compute the total earnings by summing up the income from selling both types of necklaces:\n   - Total earnings = Total income from bead necklaces + Total income from gemstone necklaces\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total earnings based on the number of necklaces sold and their price. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `necklace_earnings(NumberOfNecklaces, PricePerNecklace, TotalEarnings)` that computes the total earnings from selling necklaces.\n2. Implement the `necklace_earnings` predicate using arithmetic operations:\n   - `TotalEarnings is NumberOfNecklaces * PricePerNecklace`\n3. Define the facts representing the number of each type of necklace sold and their price:\n   - `bead_necklaces(4).`\n   - `gemstone_necklaces(3).`\n   - `necklace_price(3).`\n4. Query the total earnings by invoking the `necklace_earnings` predicate with the appropriate arguments:\n   - `?- necklace_earnings(BeadNecklaces, Price, BeadEarnings), necklace_earnings(GemstoneNecklaces, Price, GemstoneEarnings), TotalEarnings is BeadEarnings + GemstoneEarnings.`\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIsabel went on a music shopping spree and purchased a variety of albums, specifically country and pop. Each album she bought came with a lyric sheet, enhancing her listening experience. Now, we want to calculate the total number of songs she acquired across these albums. To find the answer, we need to multiply the number of albums she bought in each genre by the number of songs per album.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of songs Isabel bought, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of albums Isabel bought in each category:\n   - Country albums: 4\n   - Pop albums: 5\n2. Determine the number of songs per album:\n   - Each album has 8 songs\n3. Calculate the total number of songs:\n   - For country albums: 4 albums * 8 songs/album = 32 songs\n   - For pop albums: 5 albums * 8 songs/album = 40 songs\n4. Sum up the songs from both categories to find the grand total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of songs Isabel bought. Our plan will involve creating a predicate that takes into account the number of albums in each category and the songs per album:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalSongs)` that calculates the total number of songs Isabel bought.\n2. Calculate the total number of songs for country albums by multiplying the number of country albums by the songs per album: `CountrySongsTotal is CountryAlbums * SongsPerAlbum`.\n3. Calculate the total number of songs for pop albums by multiplying the number of pop albums by the songs per album: `PopSongsTotal is PopAlbums * SongsPerAlbum`.\n4. Compute the grand total of songs by summing up the totals from country and pop albums: `TotalSongs is CountrySongsTotal + PopSongsTotal`.\n5. Test the rule by querying it with the given values: country albums = 4, pop albums = 5, and songs per album = 8.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of songs\ntotal_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalSongs) :-\n    CountrySongsTotal is CountryAlbums * SongsPerAlbum,\n    PopSongsTotal is PopAlbums * SongsPerAlbum,\n    TotalSongs is CountrySongsTotal + PopSongsTotal.\n\n% Query to find the total number of songs Isabel bought\nquery_total_songs(TotalSongs) :-\n    total_songs(4, 5, 8, TotalSongs).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code sets up the logic to calculate the total number of songs Isabel acquired during her music shopping spree, making it easy to adapt to similar problems involving calculations and aggregations.",

She spent a fixed amount of time, specifically 4 minutes, assembling each piece of furniture. The problem requires us to calculate the total time Rachel spent assembling all the furniture.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total time Rachel spent, we need to consider the number of chairs and tables she bought and the time taken to assemble each piece.

The task is to calculate the total number of books Bianca has based on the number of shelves and the number of books per shelf.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of books Bianca has, we need to multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf for each category and then sum these quantities. Specifically, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of mystery books by multiplying the number of mystery book shelves by the number of books per shelf.\n2. Calculate the total number of picture books by multiplying the number of picture book shelves by the number of books per shelf.\n3. Add the totals from steps 1 and 2 to find the grand total of books Bianca has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of books Bianca has based on the given parameters. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_books` that takes the following parameters:\n   - `mystery_shelves`: The number of shelves containing mystery books.\n   - `picture_shelves`: The number of shelves containing picture books.\n   - `books_per_shelf`: The constant number of books per shelf (in this case, 8).\n   - `total_books`: The calculated total number of books Bianca has.\n2. Calculate the total number of mystery books by multiplying `mystery_shelves` by `books_per_shelf`.\n3. Calculate the total number of picture books by multiplying `picture_shelves` by `books_per_shelf`.\n4. Sum the totals from steps 2 and 3 to compute `total_books`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and unify the result with `total_books`.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of books\ntotal_books(MysteryShelves, PictureShelves, BooksPerShelf, TotalBooks) :-\n    TotalMysteryBooks is MysteryShelves * BooksPerShelf,\n    TotalPictureBooks is PictureShelves * BooksPerShelf,\n    TotalBooks is TotalMysteryBooks + TotalPictureBooks.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of books\n% ?- total_books(5, 4, 8, TotalBooks).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total number of books Bianca has by considering the number of shelves dedicated to each category and the constant number of books per shelf.

Specifically, he has two piles of quarters and three piles of dimes, and each pile contains four coins. The task is to determine the total number of coins Billy has across all these piles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of coins, we need to consider the number of coins in each pile and then sum them up. Given that each pile has four coins, we can calculate the total number of coins as follows:\n1. For quarters:\n   - Number of piles: 2\n   - Coins per pile: 4\n   - Total quarters: 2 piles * 4 coins/pile = 8 quarters\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nChloe is playing a video game where she earns points for finding treasures. Each treasure is worth 9 points. On the first level, she found 6 treasures, and on the second level, she found 3 treasures. To find her total score, we need to calculate the points earned on each level and then sum them up.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating Chloe's score based on the number of treasures she found on each level and the points earned per treasure. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **First Level Score**: Chloe found 6 treasures on the first level, and each treasure is worth 9 points. So, her score for the first level is 6 treasures * 9 points/treasure = 54 points.\n2. **Second Level Score**: On the second level, Chloe found 3 treasures. Following the same scoring system, her score for the second level is 3 treasures * 9 points/treasure = 27 points.\n3. **Total Score**: To find Chloe's overall score, we sum up the scores from the two levels: 54 points (first level) + 27 points (second level) = 81 points.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Chloe's total score based on the given inputs of the number of treasures found on each level and the points earned per treasure. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `level_score(NumTreasures, PointsPerTreasure, LevelScore)` that calculates the score for a single level. It takes the number of treasures found (`NumTreasures`), the points earned per treasure (`PointsPerTreasure`), and returns the score for that level (`LevelScore`).\n2. Define a predicate `total_score(FirstLevelScore, SecondLevelScore, TotalScore)` that calculates the overall total score. It takes the scores from the first and second levels (`FirstLevelScore` and `SecondLevelScore`) and returns the final total score (`TotalScore`).\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations within the predicates.\n4. Test the implementation by querying the `total_score` predicate with the given values of treasures found and points earned per treasure.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the score for a single level\nlevel_score(NumTreasures, PointsPerTreasure, LevelScore) :-\n    LevelScore is NumTreasures * PointsPerTreasure.\n\n% Calculate the total score across both levels\ntotal_score(FirstLevelScore, SecondLevelScore, TotalScore) :-\n    TotalScore is FirstLevelScore + SecondLevelScore.\n\n% Query to find the total score\n% ?- total_score(FirstLevelScore, SecondLevelScore, TotalScore).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to determine Chloe's total score.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn a collaborative online video game, the number of lives each player possesses is crucial for their survival and progression. In this scenario, we have a group of friends playing together, and we want to calculate the total number of lives they have collectively. Initially, there were eight friends, and then two more players joined the game. Each player is endowed with a fixed number of lives, specifically six lives per player. The task is to determine the cumulative number of lives this group of players has at their disposal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of lives, we need to consider the number of players and the lives available to each player. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Number of Players**: Initially, there were eight friends, and then two more joined, resulting in a total of ten players.\n2. **Lives per Player**: Each player in the game starts with a fixed allotment of six lives.\n3. **Total Lives**: To calculate the collective lives for all players, we multiply the number of players by the lives per player.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the given inputs: the initial number of friends, the additional players, and the lives per player. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate named `total_lives/3` that takes the initial number of friends (`InitialFriends`), the additional players (`AdditionalPlayers`), and the lives per player (`LivesPerPlayer`) as input.\n2. **Calculate Total Players**:\n   - Within the `total_lives` predicate, calculate the total number of players by summing `InitialFriends` and `AdditionalPlayers`.\n3. **Compute Total Lives**:\n   - Multiply the total number of players by the `LivesPerPlayer` to calculate the collective lives for all players.\n4. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Instantiate the `total_lives` predicate with the given values: `InitialFriends` as 8, `AdditionalPlayers` as 2, and `LivesPerPlayer` as 6.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total lives\ntotal_lives(InitialFriends, AdditionalPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives) :-\n    TotalPlayers is InitialFriends + AdditionalPlayers,\n    TotalLives is TotalPlayers * LivesPerPlayer.\n\n% Query to find the total lives\n% ?- total_lives(8, 2, 6, TotalLives).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `total_lives` with the given inputs, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the total number of lives the group of friends has in the video game.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSam is collecting cans for recycling and fills bags with cans over two days. On Saturday, he fills three bags, and on Sunday, he fills four more bags. Each bag contains a fixed number of cans, specifically nine cans per bag. The task is to calculate the total number of cans Sam collects over the two days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of cans Sam has collected, we need to multiply the number of cans per bag by the total number of bags filled on both days. This can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bags filled: 3 bags on Saturday + 4 bags on Sunday = 7 bags.\n2. Calculate the number of cans per bag: 9 cans (given).\n3. Multiply the total number of bags by the number of cans per bag to find the total number of cans collected: 7 bags * 9 cans/bag = 63 cans.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of cans collected based on the number of bags filled and the number of cans per bag. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule \"total_cans\" that takes the number of bags filled on Saturday (`sat_bags`), the number of bags filled on Sunday (`sun_bags`), and the number of cans per bag (`cans_per_bag`).\n2. Calculate the total number of bags filled by summing `sat_bags` and `sun_bags`.\n3. Calculate the total number of cans collected by multiplying the total number of bags by `cans_per_bag`.\n4.

She bought a combination of roses and daisies, specifically 7 roses and 3 daisies. The task is to calculate the total amount of money Maria spent on these flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total amount Maria spent, we need to calculate the cost of the roses and the daisies separately and then add these amounts together. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of roses:\n   - Number of roses = 7\n   - Price per rose = $6\n   - Total cost for roses = Number of roses * Price per rose = 7 * $6 = $42\n\n2.

        "question": "At the town carnival Oliver rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. If each ride cost 3 tickets, how many tickets did he use?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nOliver had a fun time at the town carnival, riding two different attractions: the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars. He rode the Ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. Each ride on any attraction cost 3 tickets. The task is to calculate the total number of tickets Oliver used during his time at the carnival.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to consider his rides on both attractions and the cost per ride. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n1. **Ferris Wheel Rides**: Oliver rode the Ferris wheel 7 times, and each ride cost 3 tickets. To find the total tickets used for the Ferris wheel, we multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride: 7 rides * 3 tickets/ride = 21 tickets.\n2. **Bumper Car Rides**: Oliver also rode the bumper cars 3 times, and each ride cost the same 3 tickets. For the bumper cars, we calculate: 3 rides * 3 tickets/ride = 9 tickets.\n3. **Total Tickets Used**: To find the overall total of tickets Oliver used, we sum up the tickets used for both attractions: 21 tickets (Ferris wheel) + 9 tickets (bumper cars) = 30 tickets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of tickets used based on the given input of the number of rides on each attraction and the cost per ride. Here's a structured plan:\n\n**Predicates**:\n- Define a predicate `tickets_per_ride(CostPerRide)` to represent the cost of each ride.\n- Define a predicate `total_tickets(RidesFerrisWheel, RidesBumperCars, TotalTickets)` to calculate the total number of tickets used.\n\n**Arithmetic Operations**:\n- Calculate the total tickets used for the Ferris wheel by multiplying the number of rides by the cost per ride: `FerrisWheelTickets is RidesFerrisWheel * CostPerRide`.\n- Calculate the total tickets used for the bumper cars similarly: `BumperCarsTickets is RidesBumperCars * CostPerRide`.\n- Sum up the tickets used for both attractions to find the overall total: `TotalTickets is FerrisWheelTickets + BumperCarsTickets`.\n\n**Code Structure**:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost per ride\ntickets_per_ride(CostPerRide).\n\n% Calculate the total tickets used\ntotal_tickets(RidesFerrisWheel, RidesBumperCars, TotalTickets) :-\n    FerrisWheelTickets is RidesFerrisWheel * CostPerRide,\n    BumperCarsTickets is RidesBumperCars * CostPerRide,\n    TotalTickets is FerrisWheelTickets + BumperCarsTickets.\n\n% Query to find the total tickets Oliver used\nquery_total_tickets(TotalTickets) :-\n    tickets_per_ride(3),\n    total_tickets(7, 3, TotalTickets).\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationships and calculations needed to determine the total number of tickets Oliver used at the carnival, utilizing Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.",

        "question": "While shopping for music online, Janet bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs. How many songs did Janet buy total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJanet went on a music shopping spree and bought several albums from different genres. Specifically, she purchased 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each album comes with a set of lyrics and contains 9 songs. The task is to calculate the total number of songs Janet acquired during this shopping trip.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of songs, we need to consider the number of albums purchased from each genre and the number of songs per album. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Identify the given values:\n   - Number of country albums = 6\n   - Number of pop albums = 2\n   - Number of songs per album = 9\n\n2. Calculate the total number of songs from country albums:\n   - Total country songs = Number of country albums * Number of songs per album\n\n3. Calculate the total number of songs from pop albums:\n   - Total pop songs = Number of pop albums * Number of songs per album\n\n4. Compute the grand total of songs:\n   - Total songs = Total country songs + Total pop songs\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the total number of songs based on the given information. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `country_songs(NumAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalCountrySongs)` that calculates the total number of songs from country albums.\n2. Define a predicate `pop_songs(NumAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalPopSongs)` that calculates the total number of songs from pop albums.\n3. Define a predicate `total_songs(TotalCountrySongs, TotalPopSongs, GrandTotalSongs)` that sums up the songs from both genres to find the grand total.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations:\n   - `TotalCountrySongs is NumAlbums * SongsPerAlbum.`\n   - `TotalPopSongs is NumAlbums * SongsPerAlbum.`\n   - `GrandTotalSongs is TotalCountrySongs + TotalPopSongs.`\n5. Instantiate the predicates with the given values and query the grand total:\n   - `?- country_songs(6, 9, TotalCountrySongs), pop_songs(2, 9, TotalPopSongs), total_songs(TotalCountrySongs, TotalPopSongs, GrandTotalSongs).`\n\nBy following this plan, SWI-Prolog will compute the total number of songs Janet acquired during her online music shopping. This approach demonstrates how Prolog can be used to solve basic arithmetic problems through logical inference and rule-based programming.",

The problem is to determine how many baggies of cookies she can make given the number of cookies of each type and the constraint that each baggie should contain 9 cookies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the following:\n1. **Total Number of Cookies**: Calculate the total number of cookies by adding the number of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies.\n2. **Number of Baggies**: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each baggie. This will give us the maximum number of baggies Olivia can make.\n3. **Consider Remainder**: If the total number of cookies is not evenly divisible by the number of cookies per baggie, Olivia will not be able to create a full baggie with the remaining cookies.

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a predicate for calculating the number of groups**:\n   - Parameters: Total player count, Group size.\n   - Returns: Number of groups.\n\n2. **Implement the predicate logic**:\n   - Use integer division to calculate the number of groups by dividing the total player count by the group size.\n\n3. **Test the predicate with the given values**:\n   - Use 48 as the total new player count and 6 as the returning player count.\n   - Query the predicate with these values to find the number of groups.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating the number of groups\nnumber_of_groups(TotalPlayers, GroupSize, NumGroups) :-\n    NumGroups is TotalPlayers // GroupSize.\n\n% Query the predicate with the given values\n?- number_of_groups(54, 6, NumGroups).\n```\n\nIn this code, we use integer division (`//`) to ensure that only whole numbers of groups are considered. This approach leverages Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJerry has purchased a total of 41 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas for a birthday party. He wants to store these sodas in his fridge, which can hold a maximum of 9 sodas on each shelf. The task is to determine how many shelves he will need to fill to accommodate all the sodas.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and then determine how many shelves are required to hold them all. Here are the steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of sodas: Add the number of regular sodas (41) and diet sodas (22) to get 63 sodas in total.\n2. Determine the number of shelves needed: Divide the total number of sodas (63) by the capacity of each shelf (9 sodas). This will give us the number of shelves Jerry needs to fill.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of shelves Jerry needs based on the given information.

The rules state that for every 4 pounds of recycled paper, they earn one point. Paige has recycled 14 pounds of paper, and her friends have recycled 2 pounds collectively. The task is to calculate the total number of points they have earned.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of points earned, we need to calculate how many sets of 4 pounds of paper Paige and her friends have recycled. This can be done by dividing the total recycled paper weight by 4. Then, we can multiply this quotient by the number of points earned per set of 4 pounds.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of points earned based on the given weights of recycled paper.

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `vases_needed/2` that takes the total number of flowers and the vase capacity as input parameters.\n2. Calculate the number of vases needed by dividing the total number of flowers by the vase capacity. Use the `is` operator to perform the division and unify the result.\n3. Query the `vases_needed/2` rule with the given values of the total number of flowers (54) and the vase capacity (6) to find the answer.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of vases needed\nvases_needed(TotalFlowers, VaseCapacity, NumVases) :-\n    NumVases is floor(TotalFlowers / VaseCapacity).\n\n% Query to find the number of vases needed\n% ?- vases_needed(54, 6, NumVases).\n```\n\nThis code defines a rule that calculates the number of vases needed based on the total number of flowers and the vase capacity. The `floor` function is used to round down the result of the division, ensuring that we get a whole number of vases. The query at the end will execute the rule with the given values to find the answer.",

The task is to determine how long it will take for all these puppies to be adopted if 3 puppies are adopted per day.

Calculate the total number of puppies that need to be adopted: Initial count + new arrivals = 9 + 12 = 21.\n2. Determine the number of days needed to adopt all the puppies by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day: Total puppies / Puppies per day = 21 / 3.\n3.

Calculate the number of trips for the first set of trays (17 trays):\n   - Divide the total trays by his capacity: 17 trays / 9 trays per trip = 1 remainder 8.\n2.

        "question": "For a birthday party George bought 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 4 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nGeorge has purchased a total of 32 soda cans, consisting of 10 regular sodas, and 22 diet sodas. He wants to arrange these cans in his fridge, which can hold 4 cans per shelf. The task is to determine how many shelves he will need to fill to accommodate all the soda cans.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many shelves George needs to fill, we need to calculate the total number of cans and then divide that by the number of cans each shelf can hold:\n1. Calculate the total number of soda cans: 10 regular + 22 diet = 32 cans.\n2. Determine the number of shelves needed: Total cans / Cans per shelf. That is, 32 / 4.\n3. Since there can be a fractional part in the result, round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all cans can be accommodated.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of shelves required based on the total number of soda cans and the capacity of each shelf. \n\n1. Define a predicate `total_cans(Regular, Diet, Total)` that calculates the total number of cans by summing up the regular and diet sodas.\n2. Define a predicate `shelves_needed(Total, Capacity, Shelves)` that calculates the number of shelves needed by dividing the total cans by the capacity of each shelf. Use the `ceiling` function to round up the result to the nearest integer, ensuring all cans can be accommodated.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and logical inference to relate the inputs and outputs of the predicates.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_cans(Regular, Diet, Total) :- Total is Regular + Diet.\n\nshelves_needed(Total, Capacity, Shelves) :-\n    Shelves is ceiling(Total / Capacity).\n\ngeorge_shelves(Regular, Diet, Shelves) :-\n    total_cans(Regular, Diet, Total),\n    shelves_needed(Total, 4, Shelves).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships between the number of regular and diet sodas, the total cans, and the number of shelves needed. By using the `ceiling` function, we ensure that the result is rounded up to accommodate all cans, even if there are fractional parts in the division. This approach leverages Prolog's arithmetic and logical inference capabilities to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "question": "The schools debate team had 28 boys and 4 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 4 how many groups could they make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of groups that can be formed from a group of students consisting of 28 boys and 4 girls, with each group having 4 members. To find the number of groups, we need to consider the combinations of boys and girls that can be formed to create groups of 4.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways the students can be arranged into groups of 4 while ensuring that each group has a mix of boys and girls. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students: 28 boys + 4 girls = 32 students.\n2. Determine the number of groups that can be formed with 32 students, each group containing 4 students. This can be calculated as 32 / 4 = 8 groups.\n3. Since each group should have a mix of boys and girls, we need to ensure that we don't form a group with all boys or all girls. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of combinations that satisfy this constraint.\n4. Calculate the number of combinations of boys and girls that can be made to form a group of 4:\n   - Number of combinations with 1 boy and 3 girls: 4C1 = 4\n5. Calculate the number of combinations with 2 boys and 2 girls: 4C2 = 6\n6. Calculate the number of combinations with 3 boys and 1 girl: 4C3 = 4\n7. Add the number of combinations from steps 4, 5, and 6 to find the total number of possible groups that satisfy the constraint: 4 + 6 + 4 = 14 combinations\n8. Divide the total number of groups (from step 2) by the number of possible combinations (from step 7) to find the final answer: 8 / 14\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of groups that can be formed while considering the constraint of having a mix of boys and girls in each group. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_students(Boys, Girls, Total)` that calculates the total number of students given the number of boys and girls.\n2. Define a predicate `groups_formed(Total, GroupSize, NumGroups)` that calculates the number of groups that can be formed given the total number of students and the desired group size.\n3. Define a predicate `combinations_with_constraint(Boys, Girls, GroupSize, NumCombinations)` that calculates the number of combinations of boys and girls that satisfy the constraint of having a mix of genders in each group.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve for the number of groups that can be formed while considering the constraint.\n5. Query the predicates with the given values of boys and girls to find the answer.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_students(Boys, Girls, Total) :- Total is Boys + Girls.\n\ngroups_formed(Total, GroupSize, NumGroups) :- NumGroups is Total // GroupSize.\n\ncombinations_with_constraint(Boys, Girls, GroupSize, NumCombinations) :-\n    combinations(GroupSize, Boys, BoysInGroup, GroupSize-BoysInGroup, _),\n    combinations(GroupSize, Girls, GirlsInGroup, GroupSize-GirlsInGroup, _),\n    NumCombinations #= BoysInGroup * GirlsInGroup.\n\ndebate_team_groups(Boys, Girls, NumGroups) :-\n    total_students(Boys, Girls, Total),\n    groups_formed(Total, 4, NumGroups),\n    combinations_with_constraint(Boys, Girls, 4, NumCombinations),\n    NumGroups =< NumCombinations.\n```\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's arithmetic and logical inference capabilities to calculate the number of groups that can be formed while considering the constraint of having a diverse group composition. The `combinations/4` predicate is used to generate combinations of boys and girls within a group.",

She now wants to organize these pictures into eight different albums, ensuring that each album contains the same number of pictures. To achieve this, we need to determine how many pictures should be in each album to distribute the photos evenly.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (8) to find out how many pictures should be in each album. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Total number of pictures = 5 (from the phone) + 35 (from the camera) = 40\n- Number of albums = 8\n- Pictures per album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums = 40 / 8\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of pictures that should be in each album based on the given input of the total number of pictures and the desired number of albums. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `pictures_per_album(TotalPictures, NumAlbums, PicsPerAlbum)` that calculates the number of pictures that should be in each album.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division: `PicsPerAlbum is TotalPictures // NumAlbums`. The double slash `//` is used to ensure integer division, as we want a whole number of pictures in each album.\n3. Test the predicate by querying it with the given values: `?- pictures_per_album(40, 8, PicsPerAlbum).`\n4.

To determine the number of trips he needs to make, we need to calculate how many trays he can carry in each trip and then figure out the minimum number of trips required to collect all the trays.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to collect: 9 trays from the first table + 7 trays from the second table = 16 trays in total.\n2. Determine the maximum number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip, which is eight trays.\n3. Calculate the number of trips required by dividing the total number of trays by the maximum trays he can carry in one trip. This will give us the minimum number of trips needed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of trips Jerry needs to make based on the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_trays(Table1, Table2, TotalTrays)` that calculates the total number of trays from both tables:\n   ```prolog\n   total_trays(Table1, Table2, TotalTrays) :- TotalTrays is Table1 + Table2.\n   ```\n\n2. Define a predicate `max_carry(MaxCarry)` that specifies the maximum number of trays Jerry can carry in one trip:\n   ```prolog\n   max_carry(8).\n   ```\n\n3. Define a predicate `required_trips(TotalTrays, MaxCarry, Trips)` that calculates the minimum number of trips required:\n   ```prolog\n   required_trips(TotalTrays, MaxCarry, Trips) :- Trips is ceil(TotalTrays / MaxCarry).\n   ```\n\n   Here, we use the `ceil` function to round up the result of the division, ensuring that we get the minimum number of whole trips required.\n\n4. Define a predicate `jerry_trips(Table1, Table2, Trips)` that combines the above predicates to calculate the number of trips Jerry needs to make:\n   ```prolog\n   jerry_trips(Table1, Table2, Trips) :-\n       total_trays(Table1, Table2, TotalTrays),\n       max_carry(MaxCarry),\n       required_trips(TotalTrays, MaxCarry, Trips).\n   ```\n\n5. Test the implementation by querying the `jerry_trips` predicate with the given values of trays for each table:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- jerry_trips(9, 7, Trips).\n   ```\n\nThis plan uses SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to calculate the number of trips Jerry needs to make, ensuring that he doesn't exceed his limit of carrying eight trays per trip.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nYou have a collection of flowers consisting of 6 carnations and 19 roses, and you want to arrange them in vases that can hold up to 5 flowers each. The task is to determine how many vases you will need to accommodate all these flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the number of flowers of each type and the capacity of each vase. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Total Number of Flowers**: You have a total of 6 carnations and 19 roses, so the total number of flowers is 6 + 19 = 25.\n2. **Vase Capacity**: Each vase can hold up to 5 flowers.\n3. **Calculating the Number of Vases**: To find out how many vases you need, you can divide the total number of flowers by the vase capacity: 25 / 5.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of vases required based on the total number of flowers and the vase capacity. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_flowers(Carnations, Roses, TotalFlowers)` that calculates the total number of flowers by summing up the carnations and roses.\n2. Define a predicate `vases_needed(TotalFlowers, VaseCapacity, NumVases)` that calculates the number of vases needed. It takes the total number of flowers and the vase capacity as input and computes the number of vases required.\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values of carnations, roses, and vase capacity, and use them to find the number of vases needed.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute `NumVases` based on the defined rules.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of flowers\ntotal_flowers(Carnations, Roses, TotalFlowers) :-\n    TotalFlowers is Carnations + Roses.\n\n% Define the number of vases needed\nvases_needed(TotalFlowers, VaseCapacity, NumVases) :-\n    NumVases is ceiling(TotalFlowers / VaseCapacity).\n\n% Query to find the number of vases needed\n% ?- total_flowers(6, 19, TotalFlowers), vases_needed(TotalFlowers, 5, NumVases).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we use the `ceiling` function to ensure that we get a whole number of vases, even if the division doesn't result in a whole number.

        "question": "Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nOlivia has uploaded a total of 5 pictures from her phone and 35 pictures from her camera to Facebook. She now wants to organize these pictures into eight different albums, ensuring that each album contains the same number of pictures. To achieve this, we need to determine how many pictures should be in each album, ensuring an equal distribution.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (8) to find out how many pictures should go into each album. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Total number of pictures = 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40\n- Number of albums = 8\n- Pictures per album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums = 40 / 8 = 5\n\nSo, each album should contain 5 pictures.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of pictures in each album based on the total number of pictures and the number of albums. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `pictures_per_album(TotalPictures, NumAlbums, PicsPerAlbum)` that calculates the number of pictures that should go into each album. This predicate will take the total number of pictures and the number of albums as input and output the number of pictures per album.\n\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and calculate the `PicsPerAlbum`.\n\n3. Instantiate the `pictures_per_album` predicate with the given values of `TotalPictures` as 40 and `NumAlbums` as 8 to find out the desired number of pictures in each album.\n\n4. Query the `pictures_per_album` predicate to obtain the result for `PicsPerAlbum`.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate pictures per album\npictures_per_album(TotalPictures, NumAlbums, PicsPerAlbum) :-\n    PicsPerAlbum is TotalPictures // NumAlbums.\n\n% Query to find the number of pictures in each album\n% ?- pictures_per_album(40, 8, PicsPerAlbum).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we use integer division (`//`) to ensure that only whole numbers of pictures are considered for each album.

        "question": "The schools debate team had 5 boys and 40 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of groups that can be formed from a group of students on the school's debate team. The team consists of 5 boys and 40 girls, and the goal is to divide them into groups of 9 members each. To find the number of groups, we need to calculate the total number of students and then determine how many times the group size divides the total count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students: 5 boys + 40 girls = 45 students.\n2. Determine the number of groups: Divide the total number of students by the desired group size. In this case, 45 students divided by 9 students per group.\n3. The result of the division will give the number of complete groups that can be formed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of groups that can be formed based on the total number of students and the desired group size. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `number_of_groups(TotalStudents, GroupSize, NumGroups)` that calculates the number of groups that can be formed.\n2. Calculate the total number of students by summing the number of boys and girls: `TotalStudents is Boys + Girls.`\n3. Calculate the number of groups by dividing the total number of students by the group size: `NumGroups is floor(TotalStudents / GroupSize).` The `floor/2` function is used to round down the result to the nearest integer.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n5. Query the `number_of_groups` predicate with the given values to find the number of groups that can be formed:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- number_of_groups(Total, GroupSize, NumGroups).\n   ```\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic and logical reasoning capabilities.

The plan is to divide these 30 people into 6 teams, and the question is how many people will be on each team. To solve this, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of teams to find the equal distribution of players for each team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves dividing a group of 30 people (23 managers and 7 employees) into 6 teams. To find the number of people on each team, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of players: 23 managers + 7 employees = 30 players.\n2. Divide the total number of players by the number of teams: 30 players / 6 teams.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSarah has a unique challenge with her old washing machine, which can only accommodate a limited number of clothing items per load. She needs to wash a specific number of shirts and sweaters, and we have to determine the number of loads required to complete this task.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many loads Sarah needs to do, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of clothing items:\n   - Count the number of shirts and sweaters.\n   - In this case, there are 43 shirts and 2 sweaters, so the total count is 45 items.\n\n2. Determine the number of loads:\n   - Given that the washing machine can only handle 5 items per load, we need to divide the total number of clothing items by the machine's capacity.\n   - Calculate the quotient of the division, rounding up to the nearest whole number since we cannot have fractional loads.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_loads(TotalItems, MachineCapacity, Loads)` that calculates the number of loads required to wash all the clothing items.\n2. Use the `total_loads` predicate to find the number of loads needed for Sarah's situation:\n   - Instantiate `total_loads` with the total number of clothing items (45), the machine's capacity (5), and the variable `Loads` to be determined.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and round up to the nearest whole number:\n   - Use the `ceiling` function to ensure that the result is rounded up.\n4. Query the `total_loads` predicate to find the value of `Loads`, which represents the number of loads Sarah needs to do:\n   - `?- total_loads(45, 5, Loads).`\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively use SWI-Prolog to solve the problem and determine the number of loads Sarah's old washing machine will require to wash all her clothing items.",

The question is about determining how long it will take for all these puppies to be adopted if three puppies are adopted per day. This problem involves calculating the number of days required to adopt all the puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of puppies at the shelter:\n   - Initial number of puppies = 3\n   - Additional puppies brought in = 3\n   - Total number of puppies = Initial number + Additional puppies = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n2. Determine the rate at which puppies are being adopted:\n   - Puppies adopted per day = 3\n\n3.

Determine the number of candies Ned can buy by dividing the total number of tickets by the cost of one candy.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of candies Ned can buy based on the given input of the total tickets he has won. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_tickets(WhackAMoleTickets, SkeeBallTickets, TotalTickets)` that calculates the sum of tickets won from 'whack a mole' and 'skee ball'.\n2. Define another rule named `candies_bought(TotalTickets, CostPerCandy, NumCandies)` that takes the total tickets and the cost of one candy as input and calculates the number of candies Ned can buy.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations:\n   - For the first rule, use `TotalTickets is WhackAMoleTickets + SkeeBallTickets.`\n   - For the second rule, use `NumCandies is floor(TotalTickets / CostPerCandy).` (using `floor` to round down to the nearest whole number of candies)\n4. Instantiate the predicates with the actual values from the problem: `whack_a_mole_tickets(26), skee_ball_tickets(19), cost_per_candy(9).`\n5. Query SWI-Prolog to compute `num_candies(NumCandies).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define rules for total tickets and candies bought\ntotal_tickets(WhackAMoleTickets, SkeeBallTickets, TotalTickets) :-\n    TotalTickets is WhackAMoleTickets + SkeeBallTickets.\n\ncandies_bought(TotalTickets, CostPerCandy, NumCandies) :-\n    NumCandies is floor(TotalTickets / CostPerCandy).\n\n% Sample query to find the number of candies Ned can buy\n% ?- total_tickets(26, 19, TotalTickets), candies_bought(TotalTickets, 9, NumCandies).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine how many candies Ned can buy with his won tickets, taking into account the cost of each candy.",

        "question": "Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nLuke is tasked with picking up lunch trays from two different tables, and he can carry a maximum of four trays at a time. From one table, he needs to collect 20 trays, and from the other table, he needs to collect 16 trays. The problem is to determine the minimum number of trips he needs to make to clear all the trays from both tables.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the number of trays Luke can carry in each trip and then calculate the number of trips required for each table. Finally, we need to find the total number of trips by considering both tables. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Number of Trays per Trip**: Luke can carry 4 trays at a time.\n2. **Trips for the First Table**: Calculate the number of trips required to collect 20 trays from the first table. This can be found by dividing the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip.\n3. **Trips for the Second Table**: Similarly, calculate the number of trips required to collect 16 trays from the second table by dividing the total trays by the trays per trip.\n4. **Total Trips**: Sum the number of trips required for both tables to find the minimum total number of trips Luke needs to make.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `trays_per_trip(TraysPerTrip)`: This predicate will hold the constant value of 4, indicating the maximum number of trays Luke can carry per trip.\n   - `trips_for_table(TotalTrays, TraysPerTrip, Trips)`: This predicate will calculate the number of trips required for a given number of total trays and trays per trip.\n2. **Calculate Trips for Each Table**:\n   - Use the `trips_for_table/3` predicate to calculate the number of trips for the first table (20 trays) and the second table (16 trays).\n3. **Find Total Trips**:\n   - Sum the number of trips required for both tables to find the total number of trips Luke needs to make.\n4. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the total number of trips for the given input values (20 and 16 trays) to ensure the code provides the correct answer.\n\nBy defining predicates for the number of trays per trip and the trips required for a given number of trays, we can efficiently calculate the solution and verify its correctness through testing.",

They earn points based on the weight of the paper they recycle, specifically one point for every 9 pounds of paper. Vanessa recycled 20 pounds of paper, and her friends recycled 16 pounds. The task is to calculate the total number of points they earned.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of points earned, we need to calculate the number of 9-pound increments in the recycled paper weights. This can be done through division and then multiplying by the points earned per increment:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of recycled paper: Vanessa's contribution + her friends' contribution = 20 pounds + 16 pounds = 36 pounds.\n2. Determine the number of 9-pound increments in the total weight: 36 pounds / 9 pounds per increment = 4 increments.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA pet shelter initially has two puppies, and then thirty-four more puppies are brought in, increasing the total number of puppies to thirty-six. The question asks how long it will take for all these puppies to be adopted if four puppies are adopted each day. To find the answer, we need to calculate the number of days required to adopt all the puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of days needed, we can set up and solve a simple equation:\n1. Let 'D' be the number of days required to adopt all the puppies.\n2. The total number of puppies = Initial number of puppies + Additional puppies = 2 + 34 = 36\n3. The number of puppies adopted each day = 4\n4. Set up the equation: Total number of puppies = Number of puppies adopted each day * Number of days \n   - 36 puppies = 4 puppies/day * D days\n5. Solve for 'D' to find the number of days required.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of days needed based on the given input values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `adoption_days(total_puppies, puppies_per_day, days)` that relates the total number of puppies, the number of puppies adopted per day, and the number of days required.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the number of days: `days is total_puppies // puppies_per_day`. The double slash `//` is used for integer division to ensure we get a whole number of days.\n3. Instantiate the rule with the given values: `adoption_days(36, 4, Days)`.\n4. Query SWI-Prolog to find the value of `Days`, which represents the number of days needed to adopt all the puppies.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate adoption days\nadoption_days(TotalPuppies, PuppiesPerDay, Days) :-\n    Days is TotalPuppies // PuppiesPerDay.\n\n% Query to find the number of days needed\nquery_adoption_days(Days) :-\n    adoption_days(36, 4, Days).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationship between the total number of puppies, the adoption rate, and the number of days required.

They received a shipment of 10 more bears, and then they arranged these bears on shelves with a specific number of bears per shelf. The problem is to determine the number of shelves they used, given the number of bears they placed on each shelf.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of shelves used, we need to consider the total number of bears and the arrangement of bears per shelf:\n1. **Total Number of Bears**: The store initially had 17 bears, and then they received a shipment of 10 bears, resulting in a total of 17 + 10 = 27 bears.\n2. **Arrangement of Bears on Shelves**: The store placed 9 bears on each shelf.\n3. **Calculating the Number of Shelves**: To find the number of shelves used, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of shelves used based on the total number of bears and the number of bears per shelf:\n1. **Define a predicate `shelves_used/2`**: This predicate will take the total number of bears and the number of bears per shelf as input.\n2. **Calculate the Number of Shelves**: Within the `shelves_used/2` predicate, use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears per shelf.\n3. **Test the Predicate**: Query the `shelves_used/2` predicate with the given values to find the number of shelves used.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the number of shelves used\nshelves_used(TotalBears, BearsPerShelf, NumShelves) :-\n    NumShelves is TotalBears // BearsPerShelf.\n\n% Query the predicate to find the number of shelves used\n% ?- shelves_used(27, 9, NumShelves).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we directly compute the number of shelves using integer division (`//`) to ensure that only whole numbers of shelves are considered.

        "question": "Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 8 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds, how many points did they earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nZoe and her friends are engaged in a paper recycling activity for their class. They earn points based on the weight of the paper they recycle, specifically one point for every 8 pounds of recycled paper. Zoe has recycled 25 pounds of paper, and her friends have collectively recycled 23 pounds. The task is to calculate the total number of points they have earned.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of points earned by Zoe and her friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of recycled paper:\n   - Zoe's contribution = 25 pounds\n   - Her friends' contribution = 23 pounds\n   - Total weight = Zoe's contribution + Friends' contribution\n\n2. Determine the number of points earned:\n   - Given that one point is earned for every 8 pounds of recycled paper, we can calculate the total points by dividing the total weight by 8.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_weight(ZoePounds, FriendsPounds, TotalWeight)` that calculates the total weight of recycled paper based on Zoe's contribution and her friends' collective contribution.\n2. Define a rule `points_earned(TotalWeight, Points)` that computes the number of points earned based on the total weight. This rule will divide the total weight by 8 to determine the points.\n3.

His fridge has shelves that can hold up to 7 sodas each, and he wants to know how many shelves he will need to fill up to accommodate all the sodas. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shelves required, considering the capacity of each shelf and the total quantity of sodas.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of shelves Tom will fill up, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sodas:\n   - Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas = 4 + 52 = 56 sodas\n\n2. Determine the number of shelves needed:\n   - Divide the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf (7 sodas).\n   - Number of shelves = Total sodas / Capacity per shelf = 56 / 7\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of shelves required based on the total number of sodas and the shelf capacity.

He needs to collect 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another. To determine the number of trips he needs to make, we need to calculate how many times he can fill his capacity of 7 trays for each table and then sum up the trips required for both tables.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of trips Victor needs to make, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of trips for the first table**: Divide the total trays (23) by his carrying capacity (7). This gives us the number of whole trips required for the first table.\n2. **Calculate the remaining trays for the first table**: Multiply the number of whole trips from the previous step by his carrying capacity, and subtract this from the total trays for the first table. This gives us the number of trays left after the whole trips.\n3. **Calculate the total trips for the second table**: Add the remaining trays from the first table to the number of trays from the second table (5).

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people attending the field trip:\n   - Total people = Number of students + Number of adults\n   - Total people = 40 + 14 = 54\n\n2. Determine the number of vans required:\n   - Divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.\n   - Number of vans = Total people / Capacity per van\n   - Number of vans = 54 / 9\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a plan that involves defining predicates to calculate the total number of people and the number of vans required. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_people(NumStudents, NumAdults, Total)` that calculates the total number of people attending the field trip.\n2. Define a predicate `vans_needed(TotalPeople, Capacity, Vans)` that calculates the number of vans needed based on the total number of people and the capacity of each van.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations:\n   - To find the total number of people, use `TotalPeople is NumStudents + NumAdults`.\n   - To find the number of vans, use `VansNeeded is TotalPeople // Capacity`. The `//` operator performs integer division, ensuring we get a whole number of vans.\n4. Query the `vans_needed` predicate with the given values of `NumStudents`, `NumAdults`, and `Capacity` to find the number of vans required for the field trip.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total number of people\ntotal_people(NumStudents, NumAdults, TotalPeople) :-\n    TotalPeople is NumStudents + NumAdults.\n\n% Calculate the number of vans needed\nvans_needed(TotalPeople, Capacity, VansNeeded) :-\n    VansNeeded is TotalPeople // Capacity.\n\n% Query to find the number of vans needed\nquery_vans_needed(VansNeeded) :-\n    total_people(40, 14, TotalPeople),\n    vans_needed(TotalPeople, 9, VansNeeded).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_vans_needed(VansNeeded)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of vans required for the field trip based on the given constraints.",

She plans to consume a fixed number of pieces, 9 pieces, per day. The problem requires determining how many days this candy will last, given her daily consumption rate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how long the candy will last, we need to divide the total number of candy pieces by the number of pieces she consumes daily:\n\n- Total number of candy pieces = 5 (from neighbors) + 13 (from her sister) = 18 pieces\n- Daily consumption = 9 pieces\n- To find the duration, we divide the total pieces by the daily consumption: 18 pieces / 9 pieces per day\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the duration the candy will last based on the given input values.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about a trivia team's attendance and their individual scores. Specifically, the team originally had 12 members, but during a game, only 8 members showed up. Each member who attended the game scored 8 points. The task is to calculate the total number of points scored by the team during this game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of points scored, we need to multiply the number of members who showed up by their individual scores. This can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal points = Number of members present * Points scored by each member\n\nGiven that 8 members showed up and each scored 8 points, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nTotal points = 8 members * 8 points/member = 64 points\n\nTherefore, the trivia team scored a total of 64 points during the game.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo create SWI-Prolog code for this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the total points based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_points(NumberOfMembers, PointsPerMember, TotalPoints)` that calculates the total number of points scored by the team.\n2.

Specifically, he has 16 video games in total, out of which 8 are not working. He plans to sell the working games for a set price of $7 each. The problem is to calculate the total amount of money he can earn from selling these working games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine how much money Mike can earn, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of working video games: Out of the total 16 games, subtract the number of non-working games (8). This gives us the count of working games.\n2. Calculate the total earnings: Multiply the number of working games by the selling price per game ($7).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"working_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, WorkingGames)\" that calculates the number of working games. This rule will take the total number of games and the number of non-working games as input and compute the number of working games.\n\n2. Define another rule \"total_earnings(WorkingGames, PricePerGame, TotalEarnings)\" that calculates the total amount of money earned from selling the working games. This rule will take the number of working games and the price per game as input and compute the total earnings.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values from the problem: Total games = 16, Non-working games = 8, and Price per game = 7.\n\n4.

Specifically, out of his total collection of 15 video games, 6 of them are not working. He intends to sell the operational games for a set price of $7 per game. To determine the total amount of money he can earn from selling these working games, we need to calculate the number of functional games he has and then multiply that by the selling price per game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of working video games: Given that Ned has a total of 15 video games, and 6 of them are not working, we can find the number of working games by subtracting the non-working games from the total collection. This can be calculated as: Number of working games = Total games - Non-working games = 15 - 6 = 9.\n\n2. Calculate the potential earnings from selling the working games: To find out how much money Ned can earn from selling these working games, we multiply the number of working games by the selling price per game.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn the video game, defeating each enemy earns you a fixed number of points. Specifically, you receive 5 points for each enemy you defeat. In a particular level, there are 8 enemies in total, but you only manage to destroy all but 6 of them. To determine how many points you earn, we need to calculate the number of enemies defeated and then multiply it by the points earned per enemy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many points you earn, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of enemies in the level: 8 enemies.\n2. Determine the number of enemies you failed to defeat: 8 enemies total - 6 enemies defeated = 2 enemies remaining.\n3. Calculate the number of enemies defeated: 8 enemies total - 2 enemies remaining = 6 enemies defeated.\n4. Multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy to find the total points earned: 6 enemies defeated * 5 points per enemy = 30 points earned.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total points earned based on the number of enemies defeated and the points earned per enemy. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `defeated_enemies(TotalEnemies, DefeatedEnemies, PointsEarned)`:\n   - `TotalEnemies` is the input representing the total number of enemies in the level.\n   - `DefeatedEnemies` is calculated as `TotalEnemies - EnemiesRemaining`.\n   - `PointsEarned` is calculated as `DefeatedEnemies * PointsPerEnemy`.\n2. Define the constant `PointsPerEnemy` as 5, representing the points earned for each defeated enemy.\n3. Query the `defeated_enemies` predicate with the given values to find the `PointsEarned`:\n   - `?- defeated_enemies(8, DefeatedEnemies, PointsEarned).`\n4. The query will return the value of `PointsEarned`, which represents the total points earned for defeating the specified number of enemies.\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code will allow us to compute the points earned based on the number of enemies defeated and the points earned per enemy.

Initially, he has 14 lawns to mow, but he forgets to mow 8 of them. The objective is to calculate how much money Roger actually earns given the number of lawns he mowed and the rate per lawn.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Roger earned, we need to determine the number of lawns he actually mowed and then multiply that by his earnings per lawn. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the number of lawns mowed: Given that Roger forgot to mow 8 out of the initial 14 lawns, we can find the number of lawns he mowed by subtracting the forgotten lawns from the total: 14 lawns - 8 forgotten lawns = 6 lawns mowed.\n2. Calculate Roger's earnings: To find out how much money Roger earned, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed by his earnings per lawn: Number of lawns mowed * Earnings per lawn = Total earnings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates Roger's total earnings based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.

This problem involves calculating the remaining work and estimating the time needed to complete it.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of rooms left to be painted.\n2. Given that each room takes eight hours to paint, multiply the number of remaining rooms by eight to find the total time needed to paint them.\n3. Since the painter has already spent some time painting five rooms, subtract that time from the total time needed to find out how much longer it will take.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo create SWI-Prolog code for this problem, we can structure it as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_time(RoomsLeft, HoursPerRoom, TotalTimeLeft)` that calculates the total time left to finish painting the remaining rooms. This rule will take the number of rooms left, the hours needed to paint each room, and return the total time left.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe magician is selling magic card decks for a fixed price, and we want to determine his earnings based on the number of decks sold. This problem involves calculating the revenue generated from selling a given number of decks at a known price.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money the magician earned, we need to multiply the number of decks sold by the price per deck. In this case, the magician started with 14 decks and ended up with 5 decks remaining, so he sold 14 - 5 = 9 decks. Each deck is sold for $5, so to find the total earnings, we multiply 9 by $5.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the magician's earnings based on the initial and remaining deck counts. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `earnings(InitialDecks, RemainingDecks, PricePerDeck, Earnings)` where:\n   - `InitialDecks` is the number of decks the magician starts with.\n   - `RemainingDecks` is the number of decks left at the end of the day.\n   - `PricePerDeck` is the price for which each deck is sold.\n   - `Earnings` is the total amount of money earned.\n2. Calculate the number of decks sold by subtracting `RemainingDecks` from `InitialDecks`.\n3. Calculate the `Earnings` by multiplying the number of decks sold by the `PricePerDeck`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating earnings\nearnings(InitialDecks, RemainingDecks, PricePerDeck, Earnings) :-\n    DecksSold is InitialDecks - RemainingDecks,\n    Earnings is DecksSold * PricePerDeck.\n\n% Example query to calculate earnings\n% ?- earnings(14, 5, 5, Earnings).\n% This should output the earnings with the given inputs.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the magician's earnings through logical inference and arithmetic operations, demonstrating how Prolog can be applied to solve practical problems involving basic financial calculations.",

The box initially contains 9 bars, but Wendy decides to keep 3 bars and sell the rest. The problem is to calculate the total amount of money she will make from selling the chocolate bars.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine how much money Wendy will make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars sold: Total bars in the box (9) minus the number of bars she kept (3).\n2. Calculate the total income from selling the bars: Number of bars sold multiplied by the price per bar ($3).\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total income based on the number of bars sold and the price per bar.

        "question": "In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 8 points. If a level has 7 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn the video game, you earn points by defeating enemies, and each enemy defeated awards you 8 points. You are presented with a level containing 7 enemies in total, and you manage to destroy all but 2 of them. To determine your score, you need to calculate the number of enemies defeated and then multiply that by the points earned per enemy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many points you earn, you can follow these steps:\n1. **Calculate the Number of Defeated Enemies**: Subtract the number of enemies left (2) from the total number of enemies (7). This gives you the count of enemies you successfully defeated.\n2. **Multiply by Points per Enemy**: Each defeated enemy grants you 8 points, so multiply the count of defeated enemies by 8 to find out your total score.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates your score based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. **Define a Rule for Calculating Score**:\n   - Create a predicate named `score/2` that takes the number of enemies defeated and the points earned per enemy as inputs.\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to multiply the number of defeated enemies by the points earned per enemy, storing the result in the `Score` variable.\n2. **Provide Inputs and Query**:\n   - Instantiate the `score/2` predicate with the relevant values: the number of enemies defeated (which is the total enemies minus the remaining enemies) and the points earned per enemy.\n   - Query the `score/2` predicate to find out your total score.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the score\nscore(EnemiesDefeated, PointsPerEnemy, TotalScore) :-\n    TotalScore is EnemiesDefeated * PointsPerEnemy.\n\n% Query the score for the given scenario\nquery_score(TotalScore) :-\n    EnemiesTotal is 7, % Total number of enemies\n    EnemiesDefeated is EnemiesTotal - 2, % Calculate defeated enemies\n    PointsPerEnemy is 8, % Points earned per enemy\n    score(EnemiesDefeated, PointsPerEnemy, TotalScore).\n```\n\nBy executing the `query_score/1` predicate, SWI-Prolog will compute your score based on the provided conditions, demonstrating how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving basic arithmetic operations.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe painter has a task to complete, which is painting 11 rooms in a building. He has already made some progress by painting two rooms. To determine how much longer he needs to work, we need to calculate the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms, considering that each room takes a consistent 7 hours to paint.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much longer the painter needs, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of rooms left: 11 rooms (total) - 2 rooms (painted) = 9 rooms.\n2. Determine the total time required to paint the remaining rooms: Number of remaining rooms * Time per room.\n3. Subtract the time he has already spent painting the two rooms: Total time for remaining rooms - Time spent on painted rooms.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the additional time needed by the painter. The plan involves creating predicates for each step of the analysis:\n\n1. **Define a predicate `rooms_left`** that calculates the number of rooms left to paint based on the total number of rooms and the number of rooms already painted.\n2. **Define a predicate `time_per_room`** that holds the constant value of 7 hours, representing the time it takes to paint one room.\n3. **Define a predicate `total_time_remaining`** that calculates the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms. It will be defined as `TotalTimeRemaining is RoomsLeft * TimePerRoom`.\n4. **Define a predicate `time_already_spent`** that calculates the time the painter has already spent painting the two rooms. It will be defined as `TimeAlreadySpent is 2 * TimePerRoom`.\n5. **Define a predicate `additional_time_needed`** that calculates the extra time the painter needs by subtracting the time he has already spent from the total time required for the remaining rooms.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDave possesses a collection of video games, specifically 10 in total. However, due to technical issues, 2 of these games are non-functional. He intends to sell the remaining operational games for a set price of $4 per game. The objective is to compute the total monetary amount he can anticipate earning from the sale of these functioning games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo resolve this problem, we undertake the subsequent steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of operational games: Given the total of 10 games, we subtract the 2 non-working games, resulting in 10 - 2 = 8 functioning games.\n2. Compute the anticipated earnings: To determine the potential earnings from the sale of these 8 games, we multiply the number of working games by the intended selling price per game, yielding 8 * $4 = $32.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo address this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can devise a structured plan as follows:\n\n1. **Define a predicate** `working_games(total_games, non_working, working_games)` **that computes the count of operational games**:\n   - It takes the overall number of games and the quantity of non-working games as input.\n   - It calculates and returns the count of working games.\n\n2. **Define a predicate** `expected_earnings(working_games, price_per_game, total_earnings)` **that computes the anticipated earnings**:\n   - It accepts the count of working games and the intended selling price per game as input.\n   - It multiplies the number of working games by the selling price to compute and return the total expected earnings.\n\n3. **Instantiate the predicates with actual values**:\n   - Utilize the `working_games` predicate with `total_games` as 10 and `non_working` as 2 to derive the count of working games.\n   - Employ the `expected_earnings` predicate with the derived count of working games and the selling price of $4 to compute the expected earnings.\n\n4. **Employ SWI-Prolog's query mechanism** to compute the `total_earnings` based on the defined predicates and provided values.\n\nBy adhering to this plan, we can effectively harness SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to resolve the problem, yielding the expected monetary amount Dave can earn from the sale of his functioning video games.",

        "question": "A painter needed to paint 6 rooms in a building. Each room takes 5 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe painter has a task to complete, which is painting six rooms in a building. He has made some progress and already painted two of the rooms. Now, we want to determine how much longer it will take him to finish painting the remaining rooms. Each room takes a consistent amount of time to paint, specifically five hours. The problem requires us to calculate the additional time needed to complete the task.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much longer the painter needs, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time taken to paint all six rooms. This is done by multiplying the number of rooms by the time taken to paint each room.\n2. Since the painter has already painted two rooms, we subtract that from the total time calculated in step 1 to find out how much time is left.\n3. The result from step 2 gives us the additional time required to finish painting the remaining rooms.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the additional time needed based on the given information. Our plan will include the following steps:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_time_needed(NumRooms, TimePerRoom, TotalTime)` that calculates the total time needed to paint all the rooms. It takes `NumRooms` as the number of rooms and `TimePerRoom` as the time taken to paint each room, and it calculates `TotalTime` as their product.\n\n2. Define another predicate `time_left(TotalTime, AlreadyPainted, TimeLeft)` that computes how much time is left to finish the remaining rooms. It takes `TotalTime` as the total time needed and `AlreadyPainted` as the number of rooms already painted, and it calculates `TimeLeft` as the difference between `TotalTime` and `AlreadyPainted` multiplied by `TimePerRoom`.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values from the problem: `NumRooms` as 6, `TimePerRoom` as 5, and `AlreadyPainted` as 2.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the value of `TimeLeft`, which represents how much longer the painter needs to finish the job.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_time_needed(NumRooms, TimePerRoom, TotalTime) :-\n    TotalTime is NumRooms * TimePerRoom.\n\ntime_left(TotalTime, AlreadyPainted, TimeLeft) :-\n    TimeLeft is TotalTime - (AlreadyPainted * TimePerRoom).\n\n% Sample query to find the time left\n% ?- total_time_needed(6, 5, TotalTime), time_left(TotalTime, 2, TimeLeft).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to determine the additional time required for the painter to complete his task.",

Calculate the number of members who showed up: Total members - members who didn't show up = 11 - 6 = 5.\n2. Determine the individual score of each member: Each member scored 9 points.\n3. Multiply the number of members who showed up by their individual score to find the total points scored: Number of members present * Individual score = 5 * 9.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total points scored based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_points(MembersPresent, IndividualScore, TotalPoints)` that relates the number of members present, their individual scores, and the total points scored.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to compute the total points: `TotalPoints is MembersPresent * IndividualScore`.\n3. Query the `total_points` predicate with the given values to find the solution: `?- total_points(5, 9, TotalPoints).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_points(MembersPresent, IndividualScore, TotalPoints) :-\n    TotalPoints is MembersPresent * IndividualScore.\n```\n\nThis code defines a simple rule that calculates the total points scored by multiplying the number of members present by their individual scores. By querying this rule with the provided values, SWI-Prolog will compute the total points scored by the trivia team during the game.",

The goal is to calculate how much money Rachel makes from selling the chocolate bars.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine how much money Rachel makes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars sold: Total bars in the box (13) minus the number of bars left (4) = 9 bars sold.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, a waiter has served seven customers, and only a few of them have left a tip. Specifically, five customers did not leave a tip, and we want to calculate the total amount of money the waiter earned from the tips he received. We are given that he received $3 from each of the tipping customers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the number of customers who left a tip and then multiply that by the tip amount per customer. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Identify the number of tipping customers: Given that 5 customers did not leave a tip, the remaining number of tipping customers can be calculated as: Total customers - Non-tipping customers = 7 - 5 = 2 customers.\n2. Calculate the total tip amount: To find out how much money the waiter earned from tips, we multiply the number of tipping customers by the tip amount per customer: Number of tipping customers * Tip amount per customer = 2 * $3 = $6.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total tip amount earned by the waiter based on the given information. Here's a structured plan for the code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `tipping_customers(TotalCustomers, NonTippingCustomers, TippingCustomers)` that calculates the number of tipping customers. This predicate will take the total number of customers and the number of non-tipping customers as input and output the number of tipping customers.\n\n2. Define another predicate `total_tip_amount(TippingCustomers, TipAmountPerCustomer, TotalTipAmount)` to calculate the total tip amount earned. This predicate will take the number of tipping customers and the tip amount per customer as input and output the total tip amount.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values (TotalCustomers as 7 and NonTippingCustomers as 5) to compute the `TotalTipAmount`.\n\n4.

From her total of 41 seeds, she plants 29 seeds in the big garden and an equal number of seeds in each of her small gardens. To find out how many small gardens she has, we need to determine how many seeds are planted in each small garden and then divide the remaining seeds by that number.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved through the following steps:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEdward has earned money from mowing lawns over the summer, and he wants to know how many $2 games he can buy with the money he has left after purchasing new mower blades. To solve this problem, we need to calculate his remaining balance after buying the blades and then determine how many games he can purchase with that amount.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate Edward's remaining balance: Subtract the cost of the mower blades ($21) from his total earnings ($37).\n2. Determine the number of $2 games he can buy: Divide the remaining balance by the cost of one game ($2).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of games Edward can buy based on his remaining balance.

The remaining puppies were then divided into cages, with each cage housing eight puppies. The task is to determine how many cages the store used to accommodate the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining puppies after selling 41: 81 - 41 = 40.\n2. Determine the number of cages needed for the remaining puppies by dividing the total number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage: 40 / 8.\n3. Since there might be a remainder, we need to consider both the whole number of cages and any remaining puppies that don't fill a whole cage.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of cages needed based on the initial count of puppies and the number sold.

To find out how many piles she can make, we need to determine if the remaining number of candies can be divided evenly into piles of 9.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of candies remaining after Sarah ate 36 pieces: Total candies received (108) minus candies eaten (36) = 72 candies remaining.\n2. Determine the number of piles Sarah can make: Divide the remaining candies (72) by the desired number of candies in each pile (9).

She placed 27 pictures into one album and distributed the remaining pictures into three additional albums. The problem is to determine how many pictures are in each of these three separate albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the remaining pictures after placing 27 in the first album. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Bianca has 33 pictures in total, and she puts 27 in the first album, so the remaining number of pictures is 33 - 27 = 6.\n2. These 6 remaining pictures are distributed into three separate albums.\n3. To find out how many pictures are in each of the three albums, we need to divide the remaining 6 pictures among them.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThere are 17 students trying out for the school's trivia teams, and out of these, 5 students did not get picked for any team. The remaining students are to be divided into three groups. The problem is to determine how many students will be in each group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of students in each group, we need to divide the total number of selected students by the number of groups. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the number of selected students: Total students trying out minus the number of unselected students.\n   - Total selected students = 17 - 5 = 12\n\n2. Divide the total selected students by the number of groups to find the size of each group:\n   - Number of students per group = Total selected students / Number of groups = 12 / 3\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of students in each group based on the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `students_per_group(TotalStudents, UnselectedStudents, Groups, StudentsPerGroup)` that calculates the number of students in each group.\n2.

She placed 27 pictures into one album and distributed the remaining pictures into nine separate albums. The problem is to determine how many pictures are in each of these nine separate albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of pictures in each of the nine separate albums, we can set up an equation based on the total number of pictures and the number of albums:\n1. Let 'x' be the number of pictures in each of the nine separate albums.\n2. The total number of pictures, excluding the album with 27 pictures, is 45 - 27 = 18 pictures.\n3. Since there are nine albums, each with 'x' pictures, we can set up the equation: 9x = 18.\n4. Solving for 'x,' we find that x = 18/9 = 2.\n\nSo, each of the nine separate albums contains 2 pictures.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of pictures in each of the nine separate albums based on the total number of pictures and the number of albums.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe cafeteria initially had 50 apples and distributed 5 apples to students during lunch. The remaining apples are intended for baking pies, and each pie requires 5 apples. The task is to determine how many pies the cafeteria can make with the remaining apples.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many pies the cafeteria can make, we need to calculate the number of apples left after distributing 5 to students and then determine how many sets of 5 apples (i.e., pies) can be made from that remaining quantity. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the number of apples distributed to students: 5 apples.\n2. Find the number of apples remaining after distribution: Initial apples (50) minus distributed apples (5) = 45 apples.\n3. Determine the number of pies that can be made: Divide the remaining apples (45) by the number of apples needed per pie (5).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of pies the cafeteria can make based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `pies_from_apples(InitialApples, ApplesDistributed, ApplesPerPie, TotalPies)` that takes the initial number of apples, the number of apples distributed, the number of apples needed per pie, and returns the total number of pies that can be made.\n2. Calculate the number of apples remaining after distribution: `RemainingApples is InitialApples - ApplesDistributed`.\n3. Calculate the number of pies that can be made: `TotalPies is floor(RemainingApples / ApplesPerPie)`. Here, `floor/2` is used to round down the result of the division, ensuring we don't start making a pie with insufficient apples.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n5. Test the rule by querying it with the given values: `pies_from_apples(50, 5, 5, TotalPies).`\n\nThis plan ensures that we calculate the number of remaining apples accurately and then determine the maximum number of whole pies that can be made from those apples.

Here's a structured plan for creating the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `tables_needed(Attendees, Tables)` that takes the number of attendees as input and calculates the number of tables required.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculation. Specifically, use integer division (`//`) to ensure that only whole tables are considered.\n3. Test the rule by querying it with the given values: `tables_needed(10, Tables)`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of tables needed\ntables_needed(Attendees, Tables) :-\n    Tables is Attendees // 2.\n\n% Query to find the number of tables needed for 10 attendees\n% ?- tables_needed(10, Tables).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines a simple rule to calculate the number of tables needed based on the number of attendees. The use of integer division ensures that only whole tables are considered, as partial tables are not practical in this context. The query provided will execute this calculation and return the number of tables required for the given number of attendees.",

        "question": "Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pics into one album and put the rest into 6 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley has uploaded a total of 65 pictures to Facebook and wants to organize them into albums. She has already placed 17 pictures into one album and plans to distribute the remaining pictures into six additional albums. To find out how many pictures are in each of these six albums, we need to determine the average number of pictures per album for the remaining photos.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures remaining after placing 17 pictures in the first album: Total pictures - 17 = 65 - 17 = 48.\n2. Determine the average number of pictures per album for the remaining six albums: Total remaining pictures / Number of albums = 48 / 6.\n3. Since the average may not yield a whole number, we need to consider the distribution of pictures. One way to approach this is to have some albums with one more picture than the average.\n4. Calculate the number of albums with one extra picture: Total remaining pictures modulo Number of albums = 48 modulo 6.\n5. Distribute the albums with one extra picture first, and then distribute the remaining albums with the average number of pictures.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the distribution of pictures among the six albums based on the given constraints. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `picture_distribution(TotalPictures, FirstAlbum, RemainingPictures, AvgPerAlbum, ExtraAlbums, AlbumsWithExtra)` that takes the total number of pictures, the number of pictures in the first album, and calculates the remaining pictures, average per album, number of albums with one extra picture, and a list of albums with their respective picture counts.\n2. Calculate the remaining pictures after placing some in the first album.\n3. Compute the average number of pictures per album for the remaining albums.\n4. Determine the number of albums that will have one extra picture using the modulo operator.\n5. Construct the list of albums with their picture counts, ensuring that albums with one extra picture are considered first.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and list manipulation functions to perform the calculations and construct the album list.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline:\n\n```prolog\npicture_distribution(Total, First, Remaining, Avg, Extra, Albums) :-\n    Remaining is Total - First,\n    Avg is Remaining // 6,\n    Extra is Remaining mod 6,\n    albums_with_extra(Extra, Avg, AlbumsWithExtra),\n    distribute_albums(AlbumsWithExtra, Avg, Albums).\n\nalbums_with_extra(Extra, _, []) :- Extra < 0.\nalbums_with_extra(Extra, Avg, [Avg+1|RemainingAlbums]) :- Extra > 0, Extra1 is Extra - 1, albums_with_extra(Extra1, Avg, RemainingAlbums).\n\ndistribute_albums([], _, []).\ndistribute_albums([H|T], Avg, [Avg|RemainingAlbums]) :- distribute_albums(T, Avg, RemainingAlbums).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logic to calculate the distribution of pictures among the albums, ensuring that albums with one extra picture are accounted for first. The `picture_distribution` predicate orchestrates the calculations and album construction, while helper predicates like `albums_with_extra` and `distribute_albums` handle specific aspects of the distribution.",

        "question": "A pet store had 102 puppies. In one day they sold 21 of them and put the rest into cages with 9 in each cage. How many cages did they use?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA pet store initially had 102 puppies, and they sold 21 of them in one day. To manage the remaining puppies, they decided to put them in cages, with each cage accommodating 9 puppies. The problem asks us to determine the number of cages the store used to house the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of cages used, we need to determine how many puppies are left after the sales and then calculate how many cages are needed for those puppies. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining puppies: Subtract the number of puppies sold from the initial count.\n2. Determine the number of cages required: Divide the remaining puppies by the capacity of each cage (9 puppies).\n3. Round up the result of the division to the nearest whole number since we cannot have a fraction of a cage.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_puppies(Sold, Initial, Remaining)` that calculates the number of remaining puppies based on the initial count and the number sold.\n2. Define a predicate `cages_needed(Remaining, Capacity, NumCages)` that computes the number of cages needed based on the remaining puppies and the capacity of each cage.\n3. Implement the logic for rounding up the result of the division to ensure we have enough cages to accommodate all the remaining puppies.\n4. Test the predicates by querying with the given values: `remaining_puppies(21, 102, Remaining)`, `cages_needed(Remaining, 9, NumCages)`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define the predicate `remaining_puppies/3` to calculate the remaining puppies:\n   ```prolog\n   remaining_puppies(Sold, Initial, Remaining) :-\n       Remaining is Initial - Sold.\n   ```\n\n2. Define the predicate `cages_needed/3` to calculate the number of cages needed:\n   ```prolog\n   cages_needed(Remaining, Capacity, NumCages) :-\n       NumCages is ceiling(Remaining / Capacity).\n   ```\n\n   Here, `ceiling/2` is used to round up the result of the division to ensure we have a whole number of cages.\n\n3. Query the predicates with the given values to find the number of cages used:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- remaining_puppies(21, 102, Remaining), cages_needed(Remaining, 9, NumCages).\n   ```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem, and the query will return the number of cages used to house the remaining puppies.",
