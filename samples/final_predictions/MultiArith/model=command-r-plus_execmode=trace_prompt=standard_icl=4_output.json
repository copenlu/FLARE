                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nKenny earns money by mowing lawns and plans to spend his earnings on video games and books. He charges $15 for each lawn he mows. Each video game costs $45, and each book costs $5. By the end of the summer, Kenny has mowed 35 lawns and wants to buy 5 video games. We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently."

To determine the total time taken to complete all these activities, we need to sum up the time spent on each activity. These activities include getting in shape, learning mountain climbing, climbing the seven summits, learning diving, and diving through caves.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Getting in shape: 2 years.\n2. Learning mountain climbing: Twice the time taken to get in shape, i.e., 2 * 2 = 4 years.\n3. Climbing the seven summits: Each summit takes 5 months to climb, so for seven summits, 7 * 5 = 35 months. Since 12 months make a year, this is equivalent to 35 / 12 \u2248 2.92 years.\n4. Learning to dive: 13 months, which is 13 / 12 \u2248 1.08 years.\n5. Diving through caves: 2 years.\n\nTo find the total time spent, we need to sum all these durations.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total time taken based on the given durations for each activity. Prolog's arithmetic capabilities will be used to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nThe blueprint to create a SWI-Prolog code for this scenario is as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_time` that takes variables for each activity duration and calculates the total time.\n2. Convert months to years where necessary to maintain consistency in units.\n3. Sum up the durations to get the total time.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n1. Define a predicate `convert_months_to_years(Months, Years)` that converts months to years.\n2. Define a predicate `total_bucket_list_duration(GettingInShape, LearningClimbing, ClimbingSummits, LearningDiving, DivingCaves, TotalYears)` where:\n   - `GettingInShape` is 2 (years),\n   - `LearningClimbing` is 4 (years),\n   - `ClimbingSummits` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `LearningDiving` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `DivingCaves` is 2 (years),\n   - `TotalYears` is the sum of all the above durations.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`) to perform the calculations and Prolog's logical inference to ensure the correct flow of data.\n\nThis structured approach leverages Prolog's capabilities to solve the problem through logical inference and arithmetic calculations, providing a clear and concise solution."

Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `dog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears)` that takes the brother's age in six years and computes the dog's age in six years.\n2. Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the age of Tom's dog in six years based on the given conditions."

During a sale, they sold an unspecified number of cats, given only as a total of 10 cats sold. To find out how many cats are left in the store, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of cats and the number sold.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the initial inventory: 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, for a total of 18 cats.\n2. During the sale, 10 cats were sold, but we don't know the breakdown of Siamese and house cats sold.\n3.

However, he discovers that two of the games he acquired are defective and do not function. The problem asks us to determine the number of functional games he now possesses.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Luke initially acquires four games (two from a friend and two from a garage sale).\n2. Out of the four games, two are not working.\n3. To find the number of functional games, we subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo address this issue using SWI-Prolog, we can devise a structured plan as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_games_bought(Bought)` to represent the total number of games Luke initially purchased. In this case, `Bought` should be instantiated to 4.\n2. Introduce a predicate `non_working_games(NonWorking)` to signify the number of games that are not functional. Set `NonWorking` to 2 to reflect the given information.\n3. Create a predicate `good_games(Good)` to calculate the number of functional games Luke now possesses. This can be derived by subtracting the number of non-working games from the total games bought: `Good is Bought - NonWorking`.\n4.

        "question": "John was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 21 games from a friend and bought 8 more at a garage sale. If 23 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJohn is on a mission to expand his gaming repertoire by acquiring new games from various sources. He first procures 21 games from a trusted friend, indicating his social approach to gaming and the potential for quality referrals. Eager for more, he scours a garage sale, a haven for hidden treasures, and snatches up 8 additional games. However, not all games are created equal, and John discovers that 23 of his newly acquired titles are dysfunctional, leading to a moment of disappointment. The question now is, how many functional games has John accumulated on his quest for expansion?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of functional games John acquired, we can perform the following steps:\n1. Identify the total number of games John initially obtained: 21 games from his friend and 8 from the garage sale, resulting in a sum of 29 games.\n2. Account for the non-functional games: Out of the 29 games, 23 are mentioned as defective, leaving a smaller subset of operational games.\n3. Determine the count of operational games: Given the total acquired games and the number of defective ones, we can deduce the quantity of functional games by subtracting the dysfunctional games from the total collection.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n**Predicates:**\n\n1. `initial_collection(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtFromGarageSale, TotalInitialGames)`:\n   - This predicate calculates the total number of games John initially collected.\n   - It takes the number of games bought from his friend and the number bought from the garage sale as input.\n   - The output is the sum of these two values, representing John's initial game collection.\n\n2. `non_functional_games(TotalInitialGames, NonWorkingGames, WorkingGames)`:\n   - This predicate segregates the non-functional games from John's initial collection.\n   - It takes the total initial games and the number of non-functional games as input.\n   - The output is the difference between the total initial games and the non-working games, giving us the count of functional games.\n\n3. `good_games(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtFromGarageSale, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames)`:\n   - This predicate encapsulates the entire problem, providing the final count of good games John acquired.\n   - It takes the number of games bought from the friend, the number bought from the garage sale, and the non-working games as input.\n   - The output is the count of good games John ended up with.\n\n**Code Implementation:**\n\n```prolog\ninitial_collection(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtFromGarageSale, TotalInitialGames) :-\n    TotalInitialGames is BoughtFromFriend + BoughtFromGarageSale.\n\nnon_functional_games(TotalInitialGames, NonWorkingGames, WorkingGames) :-\n    WorkingGames is TotalInitialGames - NonWorkingGames.\n\ngood_games(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtFromGarageSale, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames) :-\n    initial_collection(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtFromGarageSale, TotalInitialGames),\n    non_functional_games(TotalInitialGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames).\n```\n\n**Query:**\n\nTo find the number of good games John acquired, we can query the `good_games` predicate with the given values:\n\n```prolog\n?- good_games(21, 8, 23, GoodGames).\n```\n\nThis query will provide the count of good games John ended up with, considering his initial purchases and the non-functional games.",

Calculate the total number of pictures in both books: 10 pictures in one book + 39 pictures in the other = 49 pictures in total.\n2.

        "question": "Edward was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 41 games from a friend and bought 14 more at a garage sale. If 31 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEdward is on a mission to expand his gaming repertoire by acquiring new games from various sources. He first purchases 41 games from a friend, indicating his enthusiasm and dedication to the hobby. Subsequently, he attends a garage sale, where he finds additional gaming treasures, adding 14 more games to his collection. However, misfortune strikes as he discovers that not all the games are functional\u2014a disappointing 31 of them are non-working, leaving him with only the working games to enjoy. The objective is to determine the number of functional games he acquired through these transactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of working games Edward ended up with, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total number of games acquired:\n   - Games bought from a friend = 41\n   - Games bought at a garage sale = 14\n   - Total games acquired = 41 + 14 = 55\n\n2. Determine the number of non-working games:\n   - Non-working games = 31\n\n3. Calculate the number of working games:\n   - Working games = Total games acquired - Non-working games\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of working games Edward acquired. Our plan will involve defining predicates for the number of games bought from different sources, the number of non-working games, and then computing the count of working games. Here's a step-by-step outline:\n\n1. Define a predicate `games_bought_from_friend(Count)` to represent the number of games Edward bought from his friend.\n2. Define a predicate `games_bought_at_garage_sale(Count)` to represent the number of games he acquired at the garage sale.\n3. Define a predicate `non_working_games(Count)` to represent the number of games that didn't work.\n4. Define a predicate `working_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, WorkingGames)` to calculate the number of working games. This predicate will be derived from the total games acquired and the non-working games.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations and inferences.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ngames_bought_from_friend(41).\ngames_bought_at_garage_sale(14).\n\nnon_working_games(31).\n\nworking_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, WorkingGames) :-\n    TotalGames is GamesBoughtFromFriend + GamesBoughtAtGarageSale,\n    WorkingGames is TotalGames - NonWorkingGames.\n\ngood_games_count(WorkingGames) :-\n    games_bought_from_friend(GamesBoughtFromFriend),\n    games_bought_at_garage_sale(GamesBoughtAtGarageSale),\n    non_working_games(NonWorkingGames),\n    working_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, WorkingGames).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates for each category of games and then use them to calculate the number of working games Edward acquired. The final predicate, `good_games_count`, ties everything together to provide the answer. This approach showcases how SWI-Prolog can be used to model and solve real-world problems involving basic arithmetic and logical relationships.",

However, some of these books were used, and we want to find out how many were new. Out of the total books he bought, 15 were used, and we need to determine the number of new books he acquired.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1.

However, only 24 of these carrots turned out to be good, which means some of them were bad. The problem is to determine how many bad carrots they collected.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of bad carrots, we can use the information given about the total carrots picked and the number of good carrots:\n1. Calculate the total number of carrots picked: 17 (picked by Vanessa) + 14 (picked by her mom) = 31 carrots.\n2. Since only 24 carrots were good, we can find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the good carrots from the total: 31 total carrots - 24 good carrots = 7 bad carrots.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of bad carrots based on the input values of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom, and the number of good carrots.

        "question": "A pet store had 41 siamese cats and 28 house cats. During a sale they sold 15 cats. How many cats do they have left?",
        "plan": "### Explanation: \n\nA pet store initially had a total of 69 cats, consisting of 41 Siamese cats and 28 house cats. During a sale, some cats were sold, and now we want to determine how many cats are left in the store. To find the answer, we need to subtract the number of cats sold during the sale from the initial total.\n\n### Analysis: \n\nThe problem involves calculating the remaining number of cats after a sale. We are given the initial count of two types of cats and the number of cats sold. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Initial Cat Count**: The store had 41 Siamese cats and 28 house cats, resulting in a total of 69 cats.\n2. **Cats Sold**: During the sale, 15 cats were sold, reducing the total count.\n3. **Remaining Cats**: To find out how many cats are left, we subtract the number of cats sold from the initial total.\n\n### Plan: \n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the remaining number of cats. Our plan will involve creating predicates for the initial cat count, the number of cats sold, and the remaining cat count. Here's a detailed outline:\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - `initial_cats(Siamese, House, TotalInitial)**`: This predicate will represent the initial count of Siamese and house cats, as well as the total initial count.\n   - `cats_sold(CountSold)**: This predicate will represent the number of cats sold during the sale.\n   - `remaining_cats(TotalInitial, CountSold, Remaining)**: This predicate will calculate and return the number of cats remaining after the sale.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations. For example, in `initial_cats`, you can calculate `TotalInitial` by summing `Siamese` and `House`.\n   - Ensure that variables starting with uppercase letters are used for variables, and those starting with lowercase letters are used for constants or ground terms.\n\n3. **Query and Execution**:\n   - Define the predicates with the given values: `initial_cats(41, 28, TotalInitial)`, `cats_sold(15)`.\n   - Query for the remaining cats using the `remaining_cats` predicate: `remaining_cats(TotalInitial, CountSold, Remaining)`.\n   - The output will be the number of cats left after the sale.\n\nHere's a potential SWI-Prolog code snippet based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_cats(41, 28, TotalInitial) :- TotalInitial is 41 + 28.\n\ncats_sold(15).\n\nremaining_cats(TotalInitial, CountSold, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is TotalInitial - CountSold.\n```\n\nThis code defines the initial cat count, the number of cats sold, and then calculates the remaining cats using arithmetic operations within the `remaining_cats` predicate.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily is playing a trivia game where she accumulates points across multiple rounds. In the first round, she scores 16 points, and in the second round, she improves her score by earning 33 points. However, in the final round, she loses some points, a total of 48 points. To determine her final score, we need to calculate the net change in points across all the rounds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out Emily's final score, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Start with her initial score from the first round: 16 points.\n2. Add the points she earned in the second round: 33 points.\n3. Subtract the points she lost in the last round: -48 points.\n4. The final result will give us her score at the end of the game.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates Emily's final score based on the points earned and lost across the rounds.

Define another rule `add_second_round(InitialScore, SecondRound, TotalScoreAfterSecond)` that calculates the total score after adding the points from the second round.\n3. Define a rule `subtract_final_round(TotalScoreAfterSecond, FinalRound, FinalScore)` that subtracts the points lost in the final round to calculate Emily's final score.\n4. Create a fact for the first round score: `first_round_score(16)`.\n5. Create a fact for the second round score: `second_round_score(33)`.\n6. Create a fact for the final round lost points: `final_round_lost(48)`.\n7.

        "question": "Janet picked 4 tulips and 11 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 11 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Janet pick?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJanet picked a certain number of tulips and roses to create flower bouquets. Specifically, she collected 4 tulips and 11 roses. However, when crafting the bouquets, she only utilized 11 flowers in total. The problem asks us to determine the number of extra flowers Janet picked.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of extra flowers Janet picked, we need to compare the total number of flowers she initially collected with the number of flowers she actually used. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Initial flower count: Janet picked 4 tulips and 11 roses, resulting in a total of 15 flowers (4 + 11 = 15).\n2. Flowers used: She only needed 11 flowers in total for her bouquets.\n3. Calculate the difference: To find the number of extra flowers, subtract the number of flowers used from the initial flower count: Initial flower count - Flowers used = Extra flowers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of extra flowers based on the given inputs: the number of tulips and roses initially picked, and the total number of flowers used. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `extra_flowers/3`: The rule will take three parameters - the number of tulips picked (`TulipsPicked`), the number of roses picked (`RosesPicked`), and the total number of flowers used (`FlowersUsed`).\n2. Calculate the initial flower count: Sum the number of tulips and roses picked to find the total initial flower count (`InitialFlowerCount`).\n3. Compare and calculate the extra flowers: Subtract the `FlowersUsed` from the `InitialFlowerCount` to determine the number of extra flowers (`ExtraFlowers`).\n4. Test the rule: Query the `extra_flowers/3` rule with the given values to find the number of extra flowers Janet picked.\n\nHere's a potential SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\nextra_flowers(TulipsPicked, RosesPicked, FlowersUsed, ExtraFlowers) :-\n    InitialFlowerCount is TulipsPicked + RosesPicked,\n    ExtraFlowers is InitialFlowerCount - FlowersUsed.\n\n/*\nTest the rule with the provided values:\n?- extra_flowers(4, 11, 11, ExtraFlowers).\n*/\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of extra flowers Janet picked by summing the initial counts of tulips and roses and then subtracting the number of flowers used.

The objective is to determine how many students, out of the initial pool of tryouts, did not succeed in making it to the next stage.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of students who didn't make the cut, we need to consider the total number of tryouts and subtract those who received callbacks:\n1. Total number of tryouts: 6 girls + 48 boys = 54 students.\n2. Number of students who received callbacks: 7.\n3. Calculate the number of students who didn't make the cut: Total number of tryouts - Number of callbacks.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule named `students_not_called_back/3`: The first argument will represent the number of girls trying out, the second argument will represent the number of boys trying out, and the third argument will represent the number of students who didn't make the cut.\n2. Calculate the total number of tryouts by summing the number of girls and boys.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the addition and calculate the total number of tryouts.\n4.

The waiter initially had 26 customers, and then 27 more customers were added during the rush. However, we are told that 27 customers did not leave a tip. To find out how many customers did leave a tip, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of customers and those who didn't tip.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of customers: Start with the initial 26 customers and then add the additional 27 customers during the lunch rush, giving a total of 26 + 27 = 53 customers.\n2. Determine the number of customers who did not leave a tip: We are given that 27 customers did not tip.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe school cafeteria ordered a specific number of red and green apples in anticipation of student demand for fruit. However, the actual demand fell short, as only ten students wanted fruit. To determine the excess apples, we need to compare the total number of apples ordered to the number of students who wanted fruit and calculate the difference.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of extra apples, we can perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total number of apples ordered: 25 red apples + 17 green apples = 42 apples.\n2. Identify the number of apples wanted by students: 10 students wanting fruit.\n3. Compute the excess apples by subtracting the number of apples wanted from the total number ordered: 42 ordered - 10 wanted = 32 extra apples.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the number of apples ordered and the number wanted by students. Then, we can calculate the excess apples by finding the difference between these two values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_apples_ordered(RedApples, GreenApples, TotalApples)` that calculates the total number of apples ordered:\n   ```prolog\n   total_apples_ordered(RedApples, GreenApples, TotalApples) :-\n       TotalApples is RedApples + GreenApples.\n   ```\n2.

Initial amount of money in January: $33.\n2. Money spent by Oliver: $4.\n3. Additional money received from his mother: $32.\n4. Calculate the final amount of money by adding the initial amount and the additional funds, and then subtracting the money spent: \n   - Initial amount ($33) + Additional funds ($32) - Money spent ($4) = Final amount.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the final amount of money Oliver will have.

Define a rule \"final_amount\" that takes into account the initial amount of money, money spent, and additional funds received:\n   - `final_amount(initial_amount, money_spent, additional_funds, final_amount).`\n2. Within the rule, perform the following calculations:\n   - Calculate the impact of spending by subtracting the `money_spent` from the `initial_amount`.\n   - Add the `additional_funds` to the remaining amount after the spending.\n3. The final amount of money will be the result of these calculations.\n4. Instantiate the rule with the given values from the problem:\n   - `final_amount(33, 4, 32, FinalAmount).`\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the `FinalAmount` by executing the rule:\n   - `?- final_amount(33, 4, 32, FinalAmount).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will utilize arithmetic operations to compute the final amount of money Oliver has after his expenditures and the additional funds received from his mother.

To find the final number of roses, we need to perform these steps in sequence:\n1. Starting quantity: The florist had 37 roses initially.\n2. Sale of roses: She sold 16 roses, which reduces the count.\n3. Picking more roses: She then picked 19 roses, increasing the count.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nPaige initially had 8 songs on her MP3 player. She made two changes to her music collection: first, she deleted 5 old songs, and then she added 30 new songs. The task is to determine the final count of songs on her MP3 player after these two actions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of songs on Paige's MP3 player, we need to consider the initial count, the number of songs deleted, and the number of new songs added:\n1. Initial number of songs: 8\n2. Deletion: Paige deleted 5 old songs, decreasing the count.\n3. Addition: She then added 30 new songs, increasing the count.\n4.

The objective is to determine the total number of lives Wendy has after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many lives Wendy has after the hard part of the game and the acquisition of new lives, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Start with the initial number of lives Wendy had: 43 lives.\n2. Subtract the number of lives she lost in the hard part of the game: 43 - 8 = 35 lives remaining.\n3.

        "question": "For the school bake sale Bianca made 14 cupcakes. If she sold 6 of them and then made 17 more, how many cupcakes would she have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca, an enthusiastic baker, embarked on a mission to contribute to her school's bake sale. She initiated her endeavor by crafting a batch of 14 delectable cupcakes. Subsequently, she successfully sold 6 of them, generating a buzz among her peers. Motivated by this initial success, Bianca decided to bolster her inventory by crafting an additional 17 cupcakes. Now, the question arises: What is the total number of cupcakes Bianca has at her disposal?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of cupcakes Bianca has, we need to consider two separate batches. The first batch consists of the initial 14 cupcakes she made, and from these, she sold 6. This leaves her with 8 cupcakes from the first batch. The second batch involves the additional 17 cupcakes she made. To find the overall total, we simply add the remaining cupcakes from the first batch to the entirety of the second batch:\n\n- Total cupcakes from the first batch = 14 - 6 = 8\n- Total cupcakes from the second batch = 17\n- Total number of cupcakes Bianca has = 8 + 17 = 25\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo compute the total number of cupcakes Bianca has using SWI-Prolog, we can devise a straightforward rule that encapsulates the sequential steps of her baking and selling endeavors. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_cupcakes(InitialCupcakes, SoldCupcakes, AdditionalCupcakes, TotalCupcakes)`:\n   - `InitialCupcakes` represents the number of cupcakes Bianca made initially.\n   - `SoldCupcakes` denotes the number of cupcakes she sold.\n   - `AdditionalCupcakes` signifies the extra cupcakes she made afterward.\n   - `TotalCupcakes` will be the computed sum of cupcakes she has in the end.\n\n2. Within this rule:\n   - Calculate the remaining cupcakes from the initial batch by subtracting `SoldCupcakes` from `InitialCupcakes`.\n   - Compute the `TotalCupcakes` by summing the remaining cupcakes from the first batch and the `AdditionalCupcakes`.\n\n3. Instantiate the rule with the given values from the problem:\n   - `InitialCupcakes` is 14.\n   - `SoldCupcakes` is 6.\n   - `AdditionalCupcakes` is 17.\n\n4.

The store then removes 9 old oranges and adds 38 new ones. The task is to determine the final count of oranges in the bin after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the initial count of oranges, the number of oranges removed, and the number of new oranges added. We can calculate the final count by subtracting the removed oranges from the initial count and then adding the number of new oranges:\n\nFinal count = Initial count - Removed oranges + New oranges\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the final count of oranges in the bin based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `final_orange_count/3` that takes three parameters: the initial count of oranges (`InitialCount`), the number of old oranges removed (`Removed`), and the number of new oranges added (`Added`).\n2. Calculate the tentative count after removing the old oranges: `TentativeCount` is `InitialCount - Removed`.\n3. Calculate the final count by adding the new oranges: `FinalCount` is `TentativeCount + Added`.\n4. Instantiate the rule with the given values: `InitialCount` as 31, `Removed` as 9, and `Added` as 38.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to compute the `FinalCount`.\n\nHere's the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\nfinal_orange_count(InitialCount, Removed, Added, FinalCount) :-\n    TentativeCount is InitialCount - Removed,\n    FinalCount is TentativeCount + Added.\n\n% Example query\n% ?- final_orange_count(31, 9, 38, FinalCount).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code efficiently calculates the final count of oranges in the bin, demonstrating how Prolog can be used to model and solve simple inventory-like problems through logical inference and arithmetic operations.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley's Halloween candy adventure involves several transactions of candy. Initially, she scored a tasty treasure of 33 pieces. The very same night, she indulged in a feast, devouring 17 pieces, which left her with only 16 pieces. However, fortune smiled upon her, and her generous sister bestowed upon her an additional 19 pieces, boosting her candy collection. Now, the question arises: What is the final count of candy in Haley's possession?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of candies Haley has now, we need to consider two key transactions:\n1. Initial State: Haley starts with 33 candies.\n2. Night Feast and Sister's Gift: Haley ate 17 candies, reducing her stash to 16. Then, her sister's kindness added 19 more, boosting the count.\n\nTo find the current total, we simply subtract the candies she ate from her initial stash and then add the candies her sister gave her:\n\nFinal Total = Initial Total - Candies Eaten + Candies from Sister\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create a straightforward rule to calculate the final number of candies Haley possesses. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `haleys_candy_count` that takes into account the initial number of candies Haley scored, the amount she ate, and the additional candies her sister gave her.\n2. Within the rule, calculate the remaining candies after Haley's night feast by subtracting the eaten candies from the initial total.\n3. Add the candies given by Haley's sister to the remaining count to find the final total.\n4. Structure the rule to accept inputs for the initial candy count, the amount eaten, and the sister's gift, and provide the final candy count as the output.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code would be structured:\n\n```prolog\nhaleys_candy_count(InitialCandy, CandiesAte, SistersGift, FinalCandyCount) :-\n    CandiesAfterFeast is InitialCandy - CandiesAte,\n    FinalCandyCount is CandiesAfterFeast + SistersGift.\n```\n\nWith this code, you can query the final candy count by providing the initial candy score, the amount Haley ate, and the additional candies from her sister.

To find out how many tickets he has now, we need to account for these changes in his ticket collection.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by:\n\n1. Subtracting the number of tickets Victor spent on the beanie from the initial number of tickets he had.\n2. Adding the new tickets he won to the remaining ticket count from the first step.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a rule named `tickets(InitialTickets, SpentTickets, WonTickets, TotalTickets)` that relates the initial number of tickets, the number spent, the additional won tickets, and the final total tickets.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the remaining tickets after spending some on the beanie: `RemainingTickets is InitialTickets - SpentTickets`.\n3. Calculate the final total number of tickets by adding the remaining tickets from the first step to the newly won tickets: `TotalTickets is RemainingTickets + WonTickets`.\n4. Instantiate the rule with the given values: InitialTickets as 46, SpentTickets as 27, and WonTickets as 39.\n5.

To find out how many carrots she has in total, we need to calculate the remaining carrots from the first batch and then add the number of carrots picked in the second batch.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of carrots Chloe has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of carrots Chloe kept from the first batch: Subtract the number of carrots she threw out from the initial number picked.\n2. Add the number of carrots she picked in the second batch to the remaining carrots from the first batch.\n3. The sum of these two values will give us the total number of carrots Chloe has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the total number of carrots Chloe has based on the given information. Our plan will consist of the following steps:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_carrots(Initial, ThrewOut, SecondDayPick, Total)` that calculates the total number of carrots Chloe has at the end.\n2. Calculate the number of carrots Chloe kept from the first batch by subtracting `ThrewOut` from `Initial`.\n3. Add the number of carrots picked on the `SecondDay` to the remaining carrots from the first batch to get the `Total` number of carrots.\n4.

        "question": "Robin had 30 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 8 old songs from it and then added 10 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRobin made some changes to the songs on her MP3 player. Initially, she had 30 songs. She then deleted 8 old songs and added 10 new songs. To find out the final number of songs on her MP3 player, we need to account for these additions and deletions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of songs Robin has on her MP3 player after the changes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of songs she had (30).\n2. Subtract the number of songs she deleted (8).\n3. Add the number of new songs she added (10).\n4. The final result will give us the total number of songs on her MP3 player after the changes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the final number of songs based on the initial count, the number of deleted songs, and the number of new songs added. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `songs_after_changes(InitialSongs, DeletedSongs, AddedSongs, FinalSongs)` that takes four parameters:\n   - `InitialSongs`: The number of songs Robin had initially.\n   - `DeletedSongs`: The number of old songs she deleted.\n   - `AddedSongs`: The number of new songs she added.\n   - `FinalSongs`: The number of songs she has on her MP3 player after the changes.\n\n2. Calculate the net change in songs by subtracting the number of deleted songs from the number of added songs (`NetChange is AddedSongs - DeletedSongs`).\n3. Compute the `FinalSongs` by adding the net change to the initial number of songs (`FinalSongs is InitialSongs + NetChange`).\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and infer the value of `FinalSongs`.\n\nHere's a SWI-Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of songs after changes\nsongs_after_changes(InitialSongs, DeletedSongs, AddedSongs, FinalSongs) :-\n    NetChange is AddedSongs - DeletedSongs,\n    FinalSongs is InitialSongs + NetChange.\n\n% Example query to find the final number of songs\n% ?- songs_after_changes(30, 8, 10, FinalSongs).\n% This query should output the final number of songs Robin has on her MP3 player.\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code efficiently calculates the final number of songs on Robin's MP3 player by considering the initial count, deletions, and additions. It demonstrates how Prolog can be used to solve basic arithmetic problems through logical rules and inference.",

During a challenging part of the game, she lost 16 lives. However, in the next level, she gains a power-up that gives her 32 more lives. To determine how many lives she has after this eventful journey, we need to keep track of these changes and calculate the final number of lives she possesses.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many lives Janet has after these changes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of lives Janet had (38).\n2. Subtract the number of lives she lost in the hard part of the game (16).\n3. Add the number of extra lives she gained in the next level (32).\n4. The final number of lives she has is the sum or total of these changes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a predicate that calculates the final number of lives Janet has based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `final_lives(InitialLives, LostLives, GainedLives, FinalLives)`:\n   - `InitialLives` represents the number of lives Janet started with.\n   - `LostLives` represents the number of lives she lost in the hard part of the game.\n   - `GainedLives` represents the extra lives she gained in the next level.\n   - `FinalLives` will be the number of lives she has after these changes.\n\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - Subtract `LostLives` from `InitialLives` to find the number of lives remaining after the challenging part.\n   - Add `GainedLives` to the remaining lives to calculate the `FinalLives`.\n\n3.

After deleting 14 old songs, she added 44 new songs. The goal is to determine the total number of songs Bianca has on her MP3 player after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many songs Bianca has on her MP3 player, we need to consider the initial number of songs, the number of songs she deleted, and the number of new songs she added. Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initial Song Count**: Bianca started with 34 songs on her MP3 player.\n2. **Deletion**: She deleted 14 old songs, reducing the total count.\n3. **Addition**: Bianca then added 44 new songs, increasing the total count.\n4. **Final Song Count**: To find the total number of songs after these changes, we subtract the number of deleted songs from the initial count and then add the number of new songs.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_songs(Songs)` to represent the initial number of songs Bianca had (34 songs).\n   - `deleted_songs(Songs)` to represent the number of songs Bianca deleted (14 songs).\n   - `added_songs(Songs)` to represent the number of new songs Bianca added (44 songs).\n   - `final_song_count(Initial, Deleted, Added, Final)` to calculate the final number of songs Bianca has on her MP3 player.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the given information.\n   - For the `final_song_count` predicate, use arithmetic operations to subtract the deleted songs and add the new songs to the initial count.\n\n3. **Query and Solve**:\n   - Query the `final_song_count` predicate with the given values to find the solution.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_songs(34).\ndeleted_songs(14).\nadded_songs(44).\n\nfinal_song_count(Initial, Deleted, Added, Final) :-\n    Final is Initial - Deleted + Added.\n\nmp3_songs(Final) :-\n    initial_songs(Initial),\n    deleted_songs(Deleted),\n    added_songs(Added),\n    final_song_count(Initial, Deleted, Added, Final).\n```\n\nThis code defines the initial, deleted, and added song counts, and then calculates the final song count using arithmetic operations.

The problem involves calculating the total number of cupcakes she has after these two actions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many cupcakes Maria has in total, we need to consider the following steps:\n1. **Initial Cupcakes**: Maria starts with 19 cupcakes.\n2. **Sold Cupcakes**: She sells 5 cupcakes.\n3. **Additional Cupcakes**: Maria then makes 10 more cupcakes.\n4. **Total Cupcakes**: To find the total number of cupcakes, we add the initial number of cupcakes, subtract the sold cupcakes, and then add the additional cupcakes she made.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to represent each step of the analysis and calculate the final number of cupcakes Maria has. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_cupcakes(Cupcakes)` to represent the number of cupcakes Maria initially made.\n   - `sold_cupcakes(Sold)` to represent the number of cupcakes she sold.\n   - `additional_cupcakes(Addition)` to represent the extra cupcakes Maria made.\n   - `total_cupcakes(Total)` to calculate the final number of cupcakes Maria has.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - For example:\n     - `initial_cupcakes(19).`\n     - `sold_cupcakes(5).`\n     - `additional_cupcakes(10).`\n\n   - Define the `total_cupcakes` predicate to sum the initial cupcakes, subtract the sold cupcakes, and add the additional cupcakes:\n     ```prolog\n     total_cupcakes(Total) :-\n         initial_cupcakes(Init),\n         sold_cupcakes(Sold),\n         additional_cupcakes(Add),\n         Total is Init - Sold + Add.\n     ```\n\n3. **Query the System**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the total number of cupcakes Maria has.

The problem requires calculating the total number of carrots she has at the end of this process.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Pick**: Bianca starts with 23 carrots.\n2. **Discard**: She throws out 10 carrots.\n3. **Final Pick**: The next day, she picks 47 more carrots.\n4. **Total Carrots**: To find the total, sum the carrots from the initial and final picks and then subtract the discarded carrots.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can structure the solution as follows:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_pick(X)` to represent the number of carrots Bianca initially picked.\n   - `discard(Y)` to represent the number of carrots she threw out.\n   - `final_pick(Z)` to represent the additional carrots she picked the next day.\n   - `total_carrots(Total)` to calculate and represent the total number of carrots Bianca has at the end.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use Prolog facts and rules to define the relationships between the predicates.\n   - For example:\n     ```prolog\n     initial_pick(23).\n     discard(10).\n     final_pick(47).\n     ```\n\n3. **Calculate Total Carrots**:\n   - Define the `total_carrots/1` predicate to calculate the sum of the initial and final picks, subtracting the discarded carrots.\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform this calculation.\n\n4. **Query the Solution**:\n   - Query the `total_carrots/1` predicate to find out the total number of carrots Bianca has.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_pick(23).\ndiscard(10).\nfinal_pick(47).\n\ntotal_carrots(Total) :-\n    initial_pick(X),\n    final_pick(Y),\n    discard(Z),\n    Total is X + Y - Z.\n```\n\nThis code defines the initial, discarded, and final carrot counts.

The problem involves calculating the number of books Adam has now by considering the number of books he sold and the number of new books he purchased.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many books Adam has now, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Calculate the money earned from selling the books**: We don't have the price per book, so we'll introduce a variable, 'P', to represent the price per book. The total money earned can be calculated as 19 books times the price per book, or 19P.\n2. **Determine the number of books Adam has now**: Start with the initial 48 books. Subtract the number of books sold (19) and add the number of new books bought (38) to find the final count.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley is playing a video game and experiencing fluctuations in the number of lives she possesses. Initially, she had 14 lives, but during a challenging portion of the game, she lost 4 lives. However, her fortunes took a turn for the better in the subsequent level, where she acquired an additional 36 lives. The objective of this problem is to compute the updated total of Haley's lives, taking into account these gains and losses.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of lives Haley has after these changes, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with her initial number of lives, which is 14.\n2. Subtract the lives she lost (4 lives) from this initial amount.\n3. Add the new lives she gained in the next level (36 lives) to the result of the previous step.\n4. The final sum will give us the total number of lives Haley possesses after these adjustments.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_lives(Lives)` to represent the number of lives Haley had at the beginning.\n2. Create a predicate `lost_lives(Lost, Remaining)` to calculate the number of lives left after losing a certain number of lives.\n3. Define another predicate `gained_lives(Gained, Total)` to compute the total number of lives after gaining a specific quantity of new lives.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform addition and subtraction within the predicates.\n5. Finally, create a rule `haleys_lives(Initial, Lost, Gained, Final)` to compute the final number of lives Haley has, taking into account the initial lives, lives lost, and lives gained.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_lives(14).\n\nlost_lives(Lost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Initial - Lost.\n\ngained_lives(Gained, Total) :- Total is Remaining + Gained.\n\nhaleys_lives(Initial, Lost, Gained, Final) :-\n    initial_lives(Initial),\n    lost_lives(Lost, Remaining),\n    gained_lives(Gained, Final).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we first define the initial number of lives Haley had. Then, we create predicates to calculate the number of lives left after losing some and the total lives after gaining additional ones. Finally, we bring these predicates together to compute the final number of lives Haley possesses, considering all the changes.

To find out how many people are currently in line, we need to consider the number of people who left and the number of new individuals who joined.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the net change in the number of people waiting in line. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Initial State**: There were 31 people in line.\n2. **Change 1**: 25 people left the line. This reduces the count by 25.\n3. **Change 2**: 25 more people joined the line. This increases the count by 25.\n4. **Final State**: To find out how many people are currently in line, we need to subtract the number of people who left from the initial count and then add the number of new people who joined.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules to calculate the final number of people in line based on the given changes. Here's a structured plan for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_count(Count)` to represent the initial number of people in line.\n2. Define a predicate `people_left(LeftCount)` to represent the number of people who left the line.\n3. Define a predicate `new_people(NewCount)` to represent the number of new people who joined the line.\n4.

Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations and infer the final count.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_count(31).\npeople_left(25).\nnew_people(25).\n\nfinal_count(Final) :-\n    initial_count(Initial),\n    people_left(Left),\n    new_people(New),\n    Final is Initial - Left + New.\n\n% Sample query to find the final count\n% ?- final_count(Final).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates for each relevant aspect of the problem, using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to calculate the final count of people in line.

To find the total number of songs she has now, we need to account for both these changes. First, we need to subtract the number of songs she deleted, and then we can add the number of new songs she put on her device.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the net change in Zoe's music collection. We can solve it by performing the following steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Zoe starts with 6 songs.\n2. **Deletion**: She deletes 3 old songs, which reduces her collection by that amount.\n3. **Addition**: She then adds 20 new songs, increasing her collection.\n4. **Final State**: To find the total number of songs Zoe has now, we subtract the deleted songs from her initial collection and then add the new songs.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the final number of songs Zoe has on her MP3 player based on the initial count, the number of songs deleted, and the number of new songs added.

The question asks for the total number of oranges that would be in the bin after these two actions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of oranges in the bin after the removal and addition of oranges, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The bin starts with 40 oranges.\n2. **Removal of Old Oranges**: 25 old oranges are thrown away, reducing the count.\n3. **Addition of New Oranges**: 21 new oranges are added to the bin.\n4. **Final State**: To determine the total number of oranges in the bin after these changes, we subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial count and then add the number of new oranges.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create a straightforward rule to calculate the final count of oranges in the bin. Our plan will involve defining a predicate that encapsulates the logic of the problem:\n\n1. Define a predicate `oranges_in_bin(InitialCount, Removed, Added, FinalCount)`:\n   - `InitialCount` is the starting number of oranges in the bin.\n   - `Removed` is the number of old oranges thrown away.\n   - `Added` is the number of new oranges added to the bin.\n   - `FinalCount` is the resulting number of oranges in the bin after the removal and addition.\n\n2. Implement the logic within the predicate:\n   - Use arithmetic operations to calculate the `FinalCount`: `FinalCount is InitialCount - Removed + Added`.\n\n3. Test the implementation with a query:\n   - Input the initial count of 40 oranges, the removal of 25 old oranges, the addition of 21 new oranges, and find the `FinalCount`.\n\nHere's the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\noranges_in_bin(InitialCount, Removed, Added, FinalCount) :-\n    FinalCount is InitialCount - Removed + Added.\n\n% Sample query to find the final count of oranges\n% ?- oranges_in_bin(40, 25, 21, FinalCount).\n```\n\nThis code defines a clear and concise predicate that models the problem. By using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently calculate the final count of oranges in the bin, providing a solution that aligns with the logical analysis of the problem.",

        "question": "For the school bake sale Chloe made 28 cupcakes. If she sold 25 of them and then made 8 more, how many cupcakes would she have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nChloe initially made 28 cupcakes for the school bake sale. She then sold 25 of them and decided to make more, this time baking 8 additional cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes she has in total after these transactions, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes remaining after the sales and then add the new batch of cupcakes she made.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cupcakes remaining after Chloe sold 25 out of the initial 28 cupcakes she made: 28 - 25 = 3.\n2. Add the 8 new cupcakes she made to the remaining 3 cupcakes from the initial batch: 3 + 8 = 11.\n3. Thus, Chloe now has a total of 11 cupcakes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the final number of cupcakes Chloe has after selling and baking more. Our plan will involve defining predicates for the initial and final states, as well as the actions of selling and baking more cupcakes:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_cupcakes(Made, Sold, Remaining)` to represent the initial state, where `Made` is the number of cupcakes Chloe made, `Sold` is the number she sold, and `Remaining` is the number left after sales.\n\n2. Define a rule `bake_more_cupcakes(Remaining, Baked, NewTotal)` to represent the action of baking more cupcakes, where `Remaining` is the number of cupcakes left after sales, `Baked` is the number of new cupcakes made, and `NewTotal` is the updated total.\n\n3. Define a query `final_cupcake_count(Made, Sold, Baked, Total)` to find the total number of cupcakes Chloe has at the end, incorporating the initial state and the action of baking more:\n   - `initial_cupcakes(Made, Sold, Remaining)`.\n   - `bake_more_cupcakes(Remaining, Baked, NewTotal)`.\n   - `Total = NewTotal`.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_cupcakes(Made, Sold, Remaining) :- Remaining is Made - Sold.\n\nbake_more_cupcakes(Remaining, Baked, Total) :- Total is Remaining + Baked.\n\ncupcake_count(Made, Sold, Baked, Total) :-\n    initial_cupcakes(Made, Sold, Remaining),\n    bake_more_cupcakes(Remaining, Baked, Total).\n\n% Sample query to find the final cupcake count\n% ?- cupcake_count(28, 25, 8, Total).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code models the situation by defining rules for the initial state and the action of baking more cupcakes.

We are given the number of times he rode the Ferris wheel and the bumper cars, as well as the cost per ride. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate Tickets for Ferris Wheel**: Multiply the number of rides on the Ferris wheel by the cost per ride.\n2. **Calculate Tickets for Bumper Cars**: Multiply the number of rides on the bumper cars by the cost per ride.\n3. **Total Tickets Used**: Sum the tickets calculated for the Ferris wheel and bumper cars to find the total number of tickets Billy used.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of tickets Billy used based on the given inputs: the number of rides on each attraction and the cost per ride.

        "question": "Wendy was playing a video game where she scores 5 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 4 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second, what would her score be?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWendy is playing a video game where she earns points by finding treasures. Each treasure is worth a fixed score of 5 points. In this game, she has completed two levels, finding a different number of treasures on each level. On the first level, she discovered 4 treasures, and on the second level, she found 3 treasures. The goal is to calculate her total score based on the number of treasures she found on each level.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Wendy's total score, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the score for the first level: Since each treasure is worth 5 points, and she found 4 treasures on the first level, we multiply the number of treasures by the score per treasure: 4 treasures * 5 points/treasure.\n2. Calculate the score for the second level: Similarly, we multiply the number of treasures found on the second level by the score per treasure: 3 treasures * 5 points/treasure.\n3. Compute the total score by summing up the scores from both levels: Total score = Score from the first level + Score from the second level.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the scoring system and the number of treasures found on each level. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `treasure_score(NumTreasures, LevelScore)` to calculate the score for a given number of treasures. This predicate will use the fact that each treasure is worth 5 points:\n   ```prolog\n   treasure_score(NumTreasures, LevelScore) :- LevelScore is NumTreasures * 5.\n   ```\n2. Define a predicate `total_score(FirstLevelScore, SecondLevelScore, TotalScore)` to compute the overall score by summing up the scores from both levels:\n   ```prolog\n   total_score(FirstLevelScore, SecondLevelScore, TotalScore) :- TotalScore is FirstLevelScore + SecondLevelScore.\n   ```\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the total score by providing the number of treasures found on each level:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- treasure_score(4, FirstLevelScore), treasure_score(3, SecondLevelScore), total_score(FirstLevelScore, SecondLevelScore, TotalScore).\n   ```\n4. The Prolog code will use arithmetic operations to calculate the scores for each level and then sum them up to find the total score.\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the scoring system in SWI-Prolog, utilizing the language's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to compute the desired result.",

The task is to calculate the total number of cans collected by multiplying the number of bags by the number of cans in each bag and then summing the results for the two days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of cans collected by Paul, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1.

During the game, Adam provided correct responses to a certain number of questions across two distinct halves. In the initial half, he answered accurately on five occasions. Similarly, in the latter half, he replicated this feat, once again offering five correct answers. The objective of this problem is to compute the cumulative sum of points that Adam accumulated throughout the entirety of the trivia game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Adam's final score in the trivia game, we need to follow these steps:\n1. **Points per Question**: Each question is worth 5 points.\n2. **First Half Performance**: Adam answered 5 questions correctly in the first half.\n   - Points earned in the first half = 5 questions * 5 points/question = 25 points\n3. **Second Half Performance**: Adam answered another 5 questions correctly in the second half.\n   - Points earned in the second half = 5 questions * 5 points/question = 25 points\n4. **Total Score**: Add the points earned in both halves to find Adam's final score.\n   - Final score = Points in the first half + Points in the second half\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo compute Adam's final score in SWI-Prolog, we can establish a rule that calculates the cumulative points earned based on the number of correct answers in each half.

To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to calculate the sum of birds in all the cages.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved by multiplying the number of birds in one cage by the total number of cages. This will give us the total count of birds in the pet store.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to calculate the total number of birds in the pet store. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `birds_in_cage(Parrots, Parakeets, TotalBirdsInCage)` that calculates the total number of birds in one cage:\n   - `Parrots` is the number of parrots in each cage.\n   - `Parakeets` is the number of parakeets in each cage.\n   - `TotalBirdsInCage` is the sum of parrots and parakeets in one cage.\n\n2.

This provides us with a subtotal for the gemstone necklace earnings.\n5. Compute the overall total earnings by summing up the subtotals from the bead and gemstone necklace sales.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can create a code structure that incorporates predicates to calculate the earnings from each type of necklace and then computes the overall total. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define predicates for calculating earnings from bead and gemstone necklaces:\n   - `bead_necklace_earnings(NumberOfBeadNecklaces, Earnings)`\n   - `gemstone_necklace_earnings(NumberOfGemstoneNecklaces, Earnings)`\n2. Create a predicate that computes the total earnings by summing up the earnings from both types of necklaces:\n   - `total_earnings(Total, BeadEarnings, GemstoneEarnings)`\n3. Implement the predicates using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n   - Utilize the `is` operator to perform arithmetic calculations within the predicates.\n4. Instantiate the predicates with the given values:\n   - Number of bead necklaces: 4\n   - Number of gemstone necklaces: 3\n   - Price per necklace: 3 dollars\n5. Query the system to compute the total earnings:\n   - `?- total_earnings(TotalEarnings, BeadEarnings, GemstoneEarnings).`\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively model the problem in SWI-Prolog, leveraging its arithmetic capabilities to calculate the earnings from each type of necklace and then summing them up to find the total amount of money Katie earned from her necklace sales at the garage sale.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEdward's earnings at the grocery store depend on the number of hours he works and his hourly wage. In this case, he worked 3 hours on Monday and 5 hours on Tuesday, earning $6 per hour. The task is to calculate his total earnings over these two days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Edward made, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the total number of hours he worked across the two days:\n\n1. Calculate earnings for Monday: Hours worked (3) multiplied by the hourly wage ($6).\n2. Calculate earnings for Tuesday: Hours worked (5) multiplied by the hourly wage ($6).\n3. Sum the earnings from both days to find the total amount earned across Monday and Tuesday.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to calculate Edward's total earnings for the two days based on his hourly wage and the number of hours worked. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define a predicate for hourly earnings**:\n   - Parameters: Hours worked, Hourly wage.\n   - Returns: Earnings for that duration.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for total earnings over the two days**:\n   - Parameters: Monday hours, Tuesday hours, Hourly wage, Total earnings.\n   - Use the hourly earnings predicate to calculate earnings for each day.\n   - Sum the earnings from both days to find the total.\n\n3. **Implement the predicates**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations to calculate earnings based on hours worked and the given hourly wage.\n\n4. **Test the implementation**:\n   - Input the hours worked on Monday (3) and Tuesday (5), along with the hourly wage ($6), and verify that the output matches the expected total earnings.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with these predicates, we can accurately compute Edward's total earnings for the specified work duration and wage rate. This plan ensures a clear and logical representation of the problem in SWI-Prolog, allowing for straightforward computation and verification of the solution.",

The task is to determine the total bill for the group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Number of adults = 2\n   - Number of children = 4\n   - Cost of each meal = $3\n\n2.

        "question": "A pet store has 8 bird cages. If each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe pet store has a total of 8 bird cages, and each cage contains a fixed number of parrots and parakeets. The task is to calculate the total number of birds in the store by multiplying the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage and then summing up the counts for parrots and parakeets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the given values:\n   - Number of bird cages = 8\n   - Number of parrots in each cage = 2\n   - Number of parakeets in each cage = 7\n\n2. Calculate the total number of parrots:\n   - Total parrots = Number of cages * Number of parrots in each cage\n   - Total parrots = 8 * 2 = 16\n\n3. Calculate the total number of parakeets:\n   - Total parakeets = Number of cages * Number of parakeets in each cage\n   - Total parakeets = 8 * 7 = 56\n\n4. Compute the overall total number of birds:\n   - Total birds = Total parrots + Total parakeets\n\n5. Provide the final answer as the sum of total parrots and total parakeets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the bird counts and then query them to calculate the total number of birds in the store:\n\n1. Define predicates for the bird counts:\n   - `parrot_count/1` to represent the total number of parrots.\n   - `parakeet_count/1` to represent the total number of parakeets.\n2. Define a predicate `bird_count/1` to calculate the total number of birds:\n   - `bird_count(TotalBirds) :- parrot_count(ParrotCount), parakeet_count(ParakeetCount), TotalBirds is ParrotCount + ParakeetCount.`\n3. Implement the predicates:\n   - `parrot_count(16).`\n   - `parakeet_count(56).`\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the total bird count:\n   - `?- bird_count(TotalBirds).`\n\nThe code will use arithmetic operations and logical inference to calculate the bird counts and provide the final answer as the sum of total parrots and total parakeets.",

        "question": "Lana's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 6 dollars each. Lana bought 8 tickets for herself and her friends and 2 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nLana purchased tickets for a concert held by her favorite band. Each ticket costs a fixed price of $6. She bought 8 tickets for her friends and an additional 2 tickets in case extra people wanted to join. The task is to calculate the total amount of money Lana spent on the tickets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much Lana spent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of each ticket, which is $6.\n2. Calculate the total cost for the 8 tickets bought for her friends: 8 tickets * $6 per ticket = $48.\n3. Calculate the cost for the additional 2 tickets: 2 tickets * $6 per ticket = $12.\n4. Find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the 8 tickets and the 2 extra tickets: $48 + $12 = $60.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the cost of each ticket, the number of tickets bought, and the total amount spent. Here's an outline for the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `ticket_cost/1` to represent the cost of each ticket:\n   ```prolog\n   ticket_cost(6).\n   ```\n\n2. Define a predicate `total_cost/3` to calculate the total cost based on the number of tickets bought and the cost per ticket:\n   ```prolog\n   total_cost(NumberTickets, CostPerTicket, TotalSpent) :-\n       TotalSpent is NumberTickets * CostPerTicket.\n   ```\n\n3.

Then, we create a predicate `total_cost/3` to calculate the total cost based on the number of tickets and the cost per ticket. Finally, we use a query predicate `query_total_cost/1` to compute the total amount spent by Lana, considering the number of tickets bought for friends and the extra tickets.\n\nBy structuring the code this way, we can take advantage of SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to calculate the total amount spent on the concert tickets.",

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_score\" that takes the number of treasures found on each level and the points earned per treasure as input.\n2. Multiply the number of treasures on each level by the points per treasure to calculate the score for that level.\n3. Sum up the scores from both levels to get the total score.\n4. Test the rule by querying it with the given values: the number of treasures found on the first level (6) and the second level (3), and the points earned per treasure (9).\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ncalculate_score(treasures_first, treasures_second, points_per_treasure, total_score) :-\n    score_first is treasures_first * points_per_treasure,\n    score_second is treasures_second * points_per_treasure,\n    total_score is score_first + score_second.\n```\n\nIn this code, we define the `calculate_score` rule that takes the number of treasures found on each level and the points earned per treasure. We then use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is`) to calculate the score for each level and the total score. Finally, we can query this rule with the provided values to find out Chloe's total score.",

        "question": "Sarah had 4 pages of math homework and 6 pages of reading homework. If each page had 4 problems on it, how many problems did she have to complete total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSarah has been assigned two types of homework: math homework and reading homework. She has a specific number of pages for each type of homework, and each page contains a consistent number of problems. The goal is to determine the total number of problems she has to complete across all pages of both types of homework.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of problems Sarah has to complete, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Number of Pages and Problems per Page**:\n   - Math Homework: 4 pages, each with 4 problems\n   - Reading Homework: 6 pages, each with 4 problems\n\n2. **Calculating Total Problems**:\n   - For math homework, the total number of problems is found by multiplying the number of pages by the number of problems per page: 4 pages * 4 problems/page = 16 problems.\n   - For reading homework, the calculation is similar: 6 pages * 4 problems/page = 24 problems.\n\n3. **Sum of Total Problems**:\n   - To find the overall total, we sum up the total problems from both types of homework: 16 problems (math) + 24 problems (reading) = 40 problems.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of problems Sarah has to complete based on the given inputs: the number of pages for each type of homework and the number of problems per page.

Calculate the total number of problems for math homework by multiplying the number of pages by the problems per page.\n3. Similarly, calculate the total number of problems for reading homework.\n4. Compute the overall total by summing up the totals from math and reading homework.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n6.

This requires calculating the total number of students and then figuring out how many groups of nine can be formed from that total.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students: 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students.\n2. Determine the number of groups of nine that can be formed: Divide the total number of students by the size of each group.\n3.

She wants to organize these pictures into five different albums, ensuring that each album contains the same number of pictures. The task is to determine how many pictures will be in each album if they are distributed evenly.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (5) to find out how many pictures should go into each album.

The reward system is set up so that for every 4 pounds of recycled paper, they receive one point. The task is to calculate the total number of points earned by Paige and her friends based on the given amounts of recycled paper.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of points earned, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the Conversion Rate: For every 4 pounds of recycled paper, they earn 1 point. This is the conversion rate.\n2. Calculate Paige's Points: Paige recycled 14 pounds of paper. To find out how many points she earned, we divide her recycled weight by the conversion rate: \n   - Paige's points = 14 pounds / 4 pounds per point = 3.5 points\n3. Calculate Friends' Points: Paige's friends recycled 2 pounds of paper. We use the same conversion rate: \n   - Friends' points = 2 pounds / 4 pounds per point = 0.5 points\n4. Total Points: To find the total number of points earned by the group, we sum up Paige's points and her friends' points: \n   - Total points = Paige's points + Friends' points\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can design a solution with the following structure:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe toy store initially had 4 giant stuffed bears in stock. They received a shipment of 10 more bears, and the goal is to arrange these bears on shelves with 7 bears on each shelf. To find out how many shelves they used, we need to determine if the total number of bears can be divided evenly by the number of bears per shelf and then calculate the number of shelves used.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total number of bears and then determining how many groups of 7 bears can be formed from that total. The number of shelves used will correspond to the number of groups formed.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bears: Initial stock + bears from the shipment.\n2. Determine the number of groups of 7 bears that can be formed from the total.\n3. The number of shelves used is the same as the number of groups formed.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the total number of bears, determine the number of groups of 7 bears, and finally, find the number of shelves used. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_bears(InitialStock, Shipment, TotalBears)` that calculates the sum of the initial stock and the bears from the shipment:\n   ```prolog\n   total_bears(Initial, Shipment, Total) :-\n       Total is Initial + Shipment.\n   ```\n2. Define a predicate `groups_of_seven(TotalBears, NumShelves)` that calculates the number of shelves used. It will use SWI-Prolog's `mod/2` predicate to find the remainder when dividing the total bears by 7, ensuring that the number of bears can be evenly distributed:\n   ```prolog\n   groups_of_seven(TotalBears, NumShelves) :-\n       TotalBears mod 7 = 0,\n       NumShelves is TotalBears // 7.\n   ```\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the number of shelves used:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- total_bears(4, 10, TotalBears), groups_of_seven(TotalBears, NumShelves).\n   ```\n4. The code will use logical inference and arithmetic operations to calculate the total number of bears and then determine the number of shelves required to hold them in groups of 7.\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using Prolog's arithmetic and logical capabilities, ensuring that the number of bears can be evenly distributed among the shelves.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDave is tasked with collecting lunch trays from two tables, with a limit of carrying 9 trays at once due to his grip strength. To determine the number of trips he needs to make, we must calculate how many sets of 9 trays can be formed from the total number of trays at each table. This problem involves division and finding the remainder to understand how many trays are left after forming groups of 9.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached in the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of trays Dave needs to collect: 17 trays from one table + 55 trays from another = 72 trays in total.\n2. Determine the number of groups of 9 trays that can be formed from the total. This is calculated as 72 / 9 = 8 groups.\n3. Find out if there are any trays left after forming groups of 9. This is the remainder when 72 is divided by 9.\n4. The number of trips Dave needs to make is the sum of the complete groups and an additional trip for the remaining trays.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem can be structured as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_trays_to_collect(Table1Trays, Table2Trays, TotalTrays)` that calculates the sum of trays from both tables.\n2. Define another rule `groups_of_nine(TotalTrays, GripStrength, NumGroups, RemainingTrays)` to calculate the number of groups of 9 trays that can be formed and the trays left over.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform division and remainder calculations (`//` for integer division and `mod` for the remainder).\n4. The final rule, `trips_needed(Table1Trays, Table2Trays, GripStrength, Trips)`, will calculate the total trips needed by summing the complete groups and adding one more trip for the remaining trays.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Rule to calculate the total number of trays\ntotal_trays_to_collect(Table1, Table2, Total) :-\n    Total is Table1 + Table2.\n\n% Rule to calculate groups of 9 trays and remaining trays\ngroups_of_nine(TotalTrays, GripStrength, NumGroups, RemainingTrays) :-\n    NumGroups is TotalTrays // GripStrength,\n    RemainingTrays is TotalTrays mod GripStrength.\n\n% Rule to calculate the number of trips needed\ntrips_needed(Table1Trays, Table2Trays, GripStrength, Trips) :-\n    total_trays_to_collect(Table1Trays, Table2Trays, TotalTrays),\n    groups_of_nine(TotalTrays, GripStrength, NumGroups, RemainingTrays),\n    Trips is NumGroups + (RemainingTrays > 0).\n\n% Example query to find the number of trips\n% ?- trips_needed(17, 55, 9, Trips).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of trips Dave needs to make to collect all the trays, taking into account his grip strength and the number of trays at each table. The logical rules and arithmetic operations work together to provide a clear and concise solution.",

        "question": "For a birthday party George bought 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 4 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nGeorge has purchased a total of 32 sodas, consisting of 10 regular sodas, and 22 diet sodas. He wants to store these sodas in his fridge, which can hold 4 sodas per shelf. To determine how many shelves he would need, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and then divide that by the capacity of each shelf.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sodas: Sum of regular and diet sodas.\n2. Determine the number of shelves required: Divide the total number of sodas by the capacity per shelf.\n3. Since we are dividing discrete items (sodas) among shelves, we need to consider the remainder. If there is a remainder, that means some sodas won't fit on the last shelf, so George would need one more shelf.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of shelves George needs based on the total number of sodas and the shelf capacity. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `num_shelves` that takes four parameters: the number of regular sodas (`RegSodas`), the number of diet sodas (`DietSodas`), the shelf capacity (`Capacity`), and the resulting number of shelves (`NumShelves`).\n2. Calculate the total number of sodas by summing `RegSodas` and `DietSodas`.\n3. Use the `div` and `mod` arithmetic operations to calculate the number of shelves and check for a remainder.\n4. If there is no remainder, the number of shelves is simply `TotalSodas // Capacity`.\n5. If there is a remainder, George needs one more shelf, so `NumShelves` is calculated as `ceiling(TotalSodas / Capacity)`, where `ceiling(X)` rounds X up to the nearest integer.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of shelves\nnum_shelves(RegSodas, DietSodas, Capacity, NumShelves) :-\n    TotalSodas #= RegSodas + DietSodas,\n    ( TotalSodas mod Capacity =:= 0 ->\n        NumShelves #= TotalSodas // Capacity\n    ;\n        NumShelves #= ceiling(TotalSodas / Capacity)\n    ).\n\n% Example query to find the number of shelves needed\n% ?- num_shelves(10, 22, 4, NumShelves).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of shelves George needs to store his sodas, taking into account the discrete nature of the items and the shelf capacity.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe toy store initially had 5 giant stuffed bears in stock, and they received a shipment of 7 more bears. To organize their inventory, they placed the bears on shelves, arranging 6 bears on each shelf. The goal is to determine the number of shelves they used to display all the bears. To find the answer, we need to calculate the total number of bears and then determine how many shelves this quantity would fill.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bears: Initial stock (5) plus the bears from the new shipment (7), resulting in a total of 12 bears.\n2. Determine the number of shelves used: Divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf (6). This calculation will give us the number of shelves required to display all the bears.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_bears(InitialStock, Shipment, BearsPerShelf, TotalBears)` that calculates the total number of bears by summing the initial stock and the bears from the shipment.\n2. Define another rule named `number_of_shelves(TotalBears, BearsPerShelf, NumberOfShelves)` that calculates the number of shelves used by dividing the `TotalBears` by `BearsPerShelf`.\n3.

If there is a remainder, increment the number of pages by 1.\n4. **Test the predicate**: Provide the total number of cards (12) and the cards per page (3) as input to the predicate and query for the resulting number of pages.\n\nHere's an outline of the planned Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the number of pages\ncards_to_pages(TotalCards, CardsPerPage, Pages) :-\n    Pages is ceil(TotalCards / CardsPerPage).\n\n% Query the predicate to find the number of pages\n% ?- cards_to_pages(12, 3, Pages).\n% This query should output the number of pages required to hold all the cards.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of pages needed to organize Luke's baseball cards, taking into account the number of cards per page and ensuring that all cards are accommodated.",

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a predicate for calculating the total number of puppies**:\n   - Parameters: Initial puppy count, Additional puppies brought in.\n   - Returns: Total number of puppies.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for calculating the number of days required for adoption**:\n   - Parameters: Total number of puppies, Puppies adopted per day.\n   - Returns: Number of days required for all puppies to be adopted.\n\n3. **Implement the predicates with actual values**:\n   - Use 17 for the initial puppy count and 55 for the additional puppies brought in.\n   - Use 8 for the daily adoption rate.\n\n4. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and round the result**:\n   - Divide the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate to get the initial result.\n   - Use the `round/2` predicate to round the result to the nearest whole day.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total number of puppies\ntotal_puppies(Initial, Additional, Total) :-\n    Total is Initial + Additional.\n\n% Calculate the number of days for all puppies to be adopted\nadoption_days(TotalPuppies, AdoptionRate, Days) :-\n    total_puppies(17, 55, TotalPuppies),\n    Days is round(TotalPuppies / AdoptionRate).\n\n% Example query to calculate the number of days\n% ?- adoption_days(Total, 8).\n% This should output the number of days required for all puppies to be adopted.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of days needed to adopt all the puppies, considering the given adoption rate. It demonstrates how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving arithmetic and logical reasoning.",

Initially, the shelter has 8 puppies, and then an additional 19 puppies are brought in, resulting in a total of 27 puppies. The adoption rate is consistent at 3 puppies per day. The task is to determine how many days it will take to adopt all 27 puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days required to adopt all the puppies based on the given adoption rate.

There are a total of 23 managers and 7 employees, and they need to be divided into 6 teams. The goal is to determine how many people will be on each team and ensure that the teams are evenly distributed.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of players (managers and employees) by the number of teams. This will give us the number of people on each team. We can then analyze if this distribution is feasible and adjust the team sizes if necessary.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the facts:\n   - Total number of managers: 23.\n   - Total number of employees: 7.\n   - Desired number of teams: 6.\n\n2. Calculate the initial team size:\n   - Divide the total number of players (managers + employees) by the number of teams to get the initial team size.\n\n3. Check the feasibility of the team size:\n   - Ensure that the initial team size results in whole numbers for both managers and employees per team. If not, adjustments will be needed.\n\n4. Define SWI-Prolog predicates:\n   - Create a predicate to calculate the team size based on the total number of players and the desired number of teams.\n   - Create a predicate to distribute players evenly across teams, considering the number of managers and employees.\n\n5.

She needs to wash a specific number of shirts and sweaters, and we want to determine the minimum number of loads required to wash all these items. This problem involves dividing the total number of clothing items by the machine's capacity and potentially accounting for any remaining items that don't divide evenly.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of loads, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of clothing items: 19 shirts + 8 sweaters = 27 items.\n2. Divide the total number of items by the machine's capacity (9 items per load).\n3. If there is a remainder from the division, add one more load to accommodate the remaining items.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n1. Define a predicate \"loads_required\" that takes the total number of clothing items and the machine's capacity as input.\n2.

        "question": "Paul had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 7 dollars for his allowance, how many 5 dollar toys could he buy?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nPaul has an initial savings of $3, and he receives an additional $7 as allowance. He wants to know how many $5 toys he can buy with this total amount of money. To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of $5 toys that can be purchased without exceeding his total budget of $10.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the affordability of $5 toys with Paul's given amount of money. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Determine Paul's total amount of money: Initial savings + Allowance.\n2. Calculate the maximum number of $5 toys that can be bought with this total amount.\n3. Since each toy costs $5, divide the total amount of money by the cost of one toy.\n4. The result may include a remainder, so round down to the nearest whole number to find the maximum number of toys that can be purchased without exceeding his budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a predicate that calculates the maximum number of $5 toys Paul can buy with his total savings and allowance. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate, `toys_bought(InitialSavings, Allowance, MaxToys)`, that calculates the maximum number of $5 toys that can be bought:\n   ```prolog\n   toys_bought(InitialSavings, Allowance, MaxToys) :-\n       TotalMoney is InitialSavings + Allowance,\n       MaxToys is floor(TotalMoney / 5).\n   ```\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations:\n   - `TotalMoney is InitialSavings + Allowance` calculates Paul's total amount of money.\n   - `MaxToys is floor(TotalMoney / 5)` calculates the maximum number of toys that can be bought, rounding down to the nearest whole number.\n3. Query the predicate with Paul's initial savings and allowance to find out the maximum number of $5 toys he can buy:\n   ```prolog\n   query_toys_bought(MaxToys) :-\n       toys_bought(3, 7, MaxToys).\n   ```\n\nBy executing the query `query_toys_bought(MaxToys)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the maximum number of $5 toys that Paul can purchase with his savings and allowance. This plan demonstrates how to use Prolog's arithmetic and rounding functions to solve practical problems involving budgets and purchases.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, Vanessa and her friends are engaged in a recycling initiative where they earn points for the amount of paper they recycle. Specifically, they receive one point for every nine pounds of recycled paper. The goal is to determine the total number of points earned when Vanessa recycles 20 pounds of paper, and her friends collectively recycle 16 pounds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Understand the ratio**: Grasp the relationship between the number of pounds recycled and the points earned. In this case, for every 9 pounds, they earn 1 point.\n2. **Calculate Vanessa's points**: Determine how many sets of 9 pounds are in Vanessa's recycled paper (20 pounds). This can be done by dividing her recycled weight by 9.

The plan is to divide these players into 8 teams, and the challenge is to determine how many players will be on each team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of players (24) by the number of teams (8) to find the number of players on each team.

Find the total number of trips:\n   - Add the number of trips from steps 1 and 2 to get the overall number of trips Victor needs to make.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a predicate that calculates the number of trips required based on the total number of trays and the carrying capacity. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `trips(totalTrays, capacity, numTrips)`:\n   - This predicate will calculate the number of trips required to carry `totalTrays` given a carrying `capacity` for each trip.\n2. Calculate the number of trips for the first table:\n   - Use the `trips` predicate with the values: `totalTrays(23), capacity(7), TripsTable1`.\n3. Calculate the number of trips for the second table:\n   - Use the `trips` predicate again with the values: `totalTrays(5), capacity(7), TripsTable2`.\n4. Find the total number of trips:\n   - Add the number of trips from the two tables: `TotalTrips is TripsTable1 + TripsTable2`.\n5. Implement the `trips` predicate using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n   - `trips(TotalTrays, Capacity, NumTrips) :- NumTrips is ceiling(TotalTrays / Capacity).`\n6. Query the total number of trips:\n   - `?- trips(23, 7, TripsTable1), trips(5, 7, TripsTable2), TotalTrips is TripsTable1 + TripsTable2.`\n\nThis plan uses SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions and logical inference to calculate the number of trips required for each table and then sums them up to find the total number of trips Victor needs to make.",

He wants to know how many $5 toys he can buy with this money.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps need to be taken:\n1. Calculate Paul's total amount of money by adding his initial savings and the allowance he received: \n   - Total amount = Initial savings + Allowance\n2. Determine the number of $5 toys he can buy: \n   - Calculate the total worth of toys he can afford by dividing his total amount of money by the cost of one toy.\n   - Number of toys = Total amount of money / Cost of one toy\n3. Since he cannot buy a fraction of a toy, the number of toys he can buy is the whole number obtained from the above calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a predicate that calculates the number of $5 toys Paul can buy with his total amount of money.

        "question": "Ned bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Ned still have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, Ned initially possesses a certain number of boxes of chocolate candy, each containing a fixed number of pieces. He then gives away a portion of these boxes to his little brother. The task is to determine the number of chocolate pieces that Ned retains after this transaction.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Ned has left, we need to consider the following steps:\n1. Identify the initial number of boxes that Ned possesses, which is given as 14 boxes.\n2. Recognize that each box contains an equal number of pieces, specifically 6 pieces per box.\n3. Understand that Ned gives away a portion of his boxes to his little brother. The problem states that he gives away 7 boxes.\n4. Calculate the number of boxes that Ned has left after giving away 7 boxes to his brother.\n5. Determine the total number of chocolate pieces in the remaining boxes by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the final number of chocolate pieces Ned has left. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `remaining_chocolate_pieces(InitialBoxes, GivenBoxes, PiecesPerBox, RemainingPieces)` that computes the number of chocolate pieces Ned has left. This rule will take the initial number of boxes, the number of boxes given to his brother, the number of pieces in each box, and finally returns the number of remaining pieces.\n\n2. Within the rule, calculate the number of boxes that Ned has left after giving away some to his brother. You can compute this by subtracting the `GivenBoxes` from the `InitialBoxes`.\n\n3. Compute the `RemainingPieces` by multiplying the `PiecesPerBox` by the number of `RemainingBoxes`. This will give you the total count of chocolate pieces that Ned still possesses.\n\n4. Instantiate the rule with the actual values from the problem: `InitialBoxes` is 14, `GivenBoxes` is 7, and `PiecesPerBox` is 6.\n\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and find the value of `RemainingPieces`.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_chocolate_pieces(InitialBoxes, GivenBoxes, PiecesPerBox, RemainingPieces) :-\n    RemainingBoxes is InitialBoxes - GivenBoxes,\n    RemainingPieces is RemainingBoxes * PiecesPerBox.\n\n% Sample query to find the remaining pieces\n% ?- remaining_chocolate_pieces(14, 7, 6, RemainingPieces).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule to calculate the number of chocolate pieces Ned retains after giving some boxes to his brother.

She sells all but four of the bars from the box, and the task is to determine how much money she makes from these sales. This involves calculating the number of bars sold and then multiplying it by the cost per bar.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Olivia makes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bars in the box (given as 7 bars).\n2. Determine the number of bars she sold by subtracting the number of bars she has left (4 bars) from the total.\n3. Compute the revenue generated by multiplying the number of bars sold by the cost per bar ($3).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the revenue based on the number of bars sold and the cost per bar.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nZoe has a box of chocolate bars, and each bar costs $6. There are 13 bars in total, but she decides to sell all except for 6 bars. The task is to calculate how much money Zoe would make from selling these chocolate bars. This involves multiplying the number of sold bars by the cost per bar.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the number of bars Zoe sold. She started with 13 bars and decided to keep 6, so the number sold is the difference between these two quantities.\n2. Compute the total amount of money Zoe made by multiplying the number of sold bars by the cost per bar.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create predicates to calculate the number of bars sold and the total amount of money made. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Define a predicate `bars_sold(TotalBars, KeptBars, SoldBars)` that calculates the number of bars Zoe sold. This predicate will take the total number of bars as input and return the number of sold bars.\n2. Define a predicate `money_made(SoldBars, CostPerBar, TotalMoneyMade)` that computes the total amount of money Zoe made. This predicate will multiply the number of sold bars by the cost per bar.\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values: TotalBars as 13, KeptBars as 6, and CostPerBar as 6.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the value of `TotalMoneyMade` by executing the defined predicates.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code would look:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the number of bars Zoe sold\nbars_sold(TotalBars, KeptBars, SoldBars) :-\n    SoldBars is TotalBars - KeptBars.\n\n% Calculate the total money made by selling the bars\nmoney_made(SoldBars, CostPerBar, TotalMoneyMade) :-\n    TotalMoneyMade is SoldBars * CostPerBar.\n\n% Sample query to find out how much money Zoe made\n% ?- bars_sold(13, 6, SoldBars), money_made(SoldBars, 6, TotalMoneyMade).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships between the number of bars, the cost per bar, and the total money made. By executing the query with the provided values, SWI-Prolog will compute the number of bars Zoe sold and the corresponding total amount of money she made.",

        "question": "Will bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 3 to his little brother. If each box has 4 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Will still have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWill, the chocolate enthusiast, purchased 7 boxes of chocolate candy, each containing 4 delicious pieces. However, in a generous act, he gave 3 of those boxes to his little brother. The question now is, how many pieces of chocolate does Will have left to enjoy?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the answer, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the initial state: Will bought 7 boxes, and each box contains 4 pieces. So initially, he had 7 * 4 = 28 pieces in total.\n2. Consider the change: Will gave away 3 boxes to his brother. We need to subtract the number of pieces in these boxes from the initial total.\n3. Calculate the result: Subtract the number of pieces in 3 boxes (3 * 4 = 12) from the initial total of 28 pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define a predicate for the initial state**:\n   - Create a predicate `initial_state(TotalPieces)` that relates the total number of pieces Will has at the beginning. This predicate will be used to represent the initial condition.\n2. **Define a predicate for the change**:\n   - Create a predicate `give_away(BoxesGiven, PiecesRemaining)` that relates the number of boxes given away to the number of pieces remaining. This predicate will subtract the number of pieces in the given boxes from the initial total.\n3. **Define a predicate for the result**:\n   - Create a predicate `final_state(PiecesRemaining)` that represents the number of pieces Will has left after giving some boxes to his brother.\n4. **Implement the predicates**:\n   - Use `initial_state(TotalPieces)` to represent the initial 28 pieces.\n   - Use `give_away(BoxesGiven, PiecesRemaining)` to calculate the number of pieces remaining after giving away boxes. This will involve multiplication and subtraction.\n5. **Query the final state**:\n   - Use a query like `?- give_away(3, PiecesRemaining).` to find out how many pieces Will has left.\n\nBy structuring the SWI-Prolog code in this way, we can model the problem and use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations. This approach allows us to logically represent the initial state, the change, and the final state, making the solution clear and concise.",

To find out how long it will take to cook the remaining potatoes, we need to calculate the cooking time based on the number of potatoes left and the time it takes to cook each potato.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven:\n- Total number of potatoes: 12\n- Potatoes already cooked: 6\n- Time to cook one potato: 6 minutes\n\nTo find:\n- Time to cook the remaining potatoes\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to calculate the time required to cook the remaining potatoes. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `cooking_time(Potatoes, Time)` to calculate the total cooking time for a given number of potatoes. This predicate will multiply the number of potatoes by the cooking time per potato.\n\n2. Create a rule `remaining_potatoes(Total, Cooked, Remaining)` to find out how many potatoes still need to be cooked. This rule will subtract the number of cooked potatoes from the total.\n\n3. Use another rule `time_for_remaining(Remaining, TimePerPotato, TotalTime)` to calculate the total time needed to cook the remaining potatoes. This rule will multiply the number of remaining potatoes by the time per potato.\n\n4. Instantiate the predicates with the given values and use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to compute the time required to cook the remaining potatoes:\n   - `cooking_time(Potatoes, TimePerPotato, TotalTime)`\n   - `remaining_potatoes(Total, Cooked, Remaining)`\n   - `time_for_remaining(Remaining, TimePerPotato, TimeNeeded)`\n\n5. The query will look like:\n   - `time_needed(Total, Cooked, TimePerPotato, TimeNeeded)`\n\n6. SWI-Prolog will then compute the time required to cook the remaining potatoes based on the provided information.\n\nThis plan uses simple arithmetic operations and logical relationships in SWI-Prolog to calculate the desired cooking time for the remaining potatoes.",

The builder has already installed 6 windows, and we know that it takes 6 hours to install each window. We need to determine how long it will take to install the remaining windows at the same rate of installation.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Find the number of remaining windows: Given that the builder needs to install a total of 9 windows, and he has already installed 6, we can calculate the remaining windows by subtracting 6 from 9, resulting in 3 windows left to be installed.\n2. Calculate the total time required to install the remaining windows: If it takes 6 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of remaining windows by the time taken to install each one.

        "question": "At lunch a waiter had 10 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $3 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe waiter has served ten customers, and five of them did not leave a tip. We want to calculate the total amount of money the waiter earned from the customers who tipped. Each tipping customer gave the waiter $3. To find the total earnings from tips, we need to multiply the number of tipping customers by the amount of tip each left.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the number of customers who tipped and then finding the total tip amount they contributed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Identify the number of customers who tipped: Out of 10 customers, 5 left no tip, so the number of tipping customers is 10 - 5 = 5 customers.\n2. Calculate the total tip amount: Multiply the number of tipping customers by the tip amount per customer: Number of tipping customers * Tip amount per customer = Total tip amount.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the total tip amount earned by the waiter. We will define predicates to represent the number of customers who tipped and to compute the total earnings from tips. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `tipping_customers(TotalCustomers, NonTipping, Tipping)` that relates the total number of customers to the counts of non-tipping and tipping customers.\n2. Define a predicate `total_tip_amount(Tipping, TipAmountPerCustomer, TotalEarnings)` that calculates the total tip amount earned based on the number of tipping customers and the tip amount per customer.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - For multiplication: `TotalEarnings is Tipping * TipAmountPerCustomer.`\n4. Query the predicates to find the total tip amount earned:\n   - `?- total_tip_amount(Tipping, 3, TotalEarnings).`\n\nHere's a code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\ntipping_customers(Total, NonTipping, Tipping) :- Total is NonTipping + Tipping.\n\ntotal_tip_amount(Tipping, TipAmount, TotalEarnings) :- TotalEarnings is Tipping * TipAmount.\n\nwaiter_earnings(TotalCustomers, NonTipping, TipAmountPerCustomer, TotalEarnings) :-\n    tipping_customers(TotalCustomers, NonTipping, Tipping),\n    total_tip_amount(Tipping, TipAmountPerCustomer, TotalEarnings).\n\n% Example query\n?- waiter_earnings(10, 5, 3, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total tip amount earned by the waiter through logical inference and arithmetic operations, demonstrating how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving basic calculations.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca earns points for recycling bags of cans, with a specific reward rate: a certain number of points for each bag. In this case, she has a collection of bags but didn't recycle all of them. To find out how many points she earned, we need to consider the number of bags she had, the number she didn't recycle, and the points earned per bag.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the number of points Bianca earned based on the following factors:\n1. Bianca had a total of 17 bags.\n2. She didn't recycle 8 of those bags.\n3. She earns 5 points for each bag she recycles.\n\nTo determine the total number of points, we need to:\n1. Calculate the number of bags she actually recycled: Total bags - bags not recycled.\n2. Multiply the number of recycled bags by the points earned per bag.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of points Bianca earned based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_bags(Total, Recycled, NotRecycled)` to relate the total number of bags, the number of recycled bags, and the number of non-recycled bags. This predicate will ensure that the number of non-recycled bags is subtracted from the total to get the recycled bags.\n2. Define a predicate `points_earned(Recycled, PointsPerBag, TotalPoints)` to calculate the total number of points earned. This predicate will multiply the number of recycled bags by the points earned per bag.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - For multiplication: `TotalPoints is Recycled * PointsPerBag.`\n4. Define the main predicate `bianca_points(TotalBags, NotRecycledBags, PointsPerBag, TotalEarnedPoints)` to encapsulate the problem:\n   - `bianca_points(Total, NotRecycled, Points, Total) :- total_bags(Total, Recycled, NotRecycled), points_earned(Recycled, Points, Total).`\n5. Query the `bianca_points` predicate with the given values to find out how many points Bianca earned:\n   - `?- bianca_points(17, 8, 5, TotalPoints).`\n\nThis plan outlines a clear structure for the SWI-Prolog code, utilizing logical relationships and arithmetic operations to calculate the number of points Bianca earned for recycling bags.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe chef has a task to cook a specific number of potatoes, and he has already made some progress by cooking a portion of them. To determine how long it will take to cook the remaining potatoes, we need to calculate the cooking time based on the number of potatoes left and the time it takes to cook each potato.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves calculating the remaining cooking time by considering the number of potatoes already cooked and the total target. We can break it down as follows:\n\n1. Find the number of potatoes left to be cooked by subtracting the number already cooked from the total target.\n2. Determine the cooking time for each potato, which is given as 8 minutes per potato.\n3. Calculate the total remaining cooking time by multiplying the number of potatoes left by the cooking time per potato.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the remaining cooking time based on the number of potatoes left and the cooking time per potato.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about a group of friends playing a video game online. Initially, there were ten friends playing, but then seven of them quit the game. We want to find out how many lives the remaining players have in total, given that each player has eight lives.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of players remaining after seven players quit. We start with ten players, so the number of remaining players is 10 - 7 = 3 players.\n2. Calculate the total number of lives for each player. Given that each player has eight lives, we multiply the number of remaining players by the number of lives per player: 3 players * 8 lives/player.\n3. The total number of lives the remaining players have is the result of the multiplication from step 2: Total lives = 3 players * 8 lives/player = 24 lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the total number of lives the remaining players have. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_players(InitialPlayers, QuitPlayers, RemainingPlayers)` that calculates the number of players left after a certain number of players quit.\n2. Define a predicate `lives_per_player(Lives)` to represent the fact that each player has eight lives.\n3. Define a predicate `total_lives(RemainingPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives)` to calculate the total number of lives by multiplying the number of remaining players by the lives per player.\n4. Implement the logic by creating rules that relate these predicates and perform the necessary calculations.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform multiplication and addition.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of lives per player\nlives_per_player(8).\n\n% Calculate the number of remaining players\nremaining_players(InitialPlayers, QuitPlayers, RemainingPlayers) :-\n    RemainingPlayers is InitialPlayers - QuitPlayers.\n\n% Calculate the total number of lives\ntotal_lives(RemainingPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives) :-\n    TotalLives is RemainingPlayers * LivesPerPlayer.\n\n% Query to find the total number of lives when 7 players quit out of 10\nquery_total_lives(TotalLives) :-\n    remaining_players(10, 7, RemainingPlayers),\n    total_lives(RemainingPlayers, 8, TotalLives).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates for the number of lives per player, the number of remaining players, and the total number of lives. By querying `query_total_lives(TotalLives)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the total number of lives the remaining players have, which is 24 lives in this case.",

Determine the total time required to paint the remaining rooms: If each room takes 7 hours, then for 9 rooms, it will take 9 * 7 hours.\n3. Since the painter has already spent time painting two rooms, we need to subtract the time taken for those rooms from the total time: Total time remaining = Total time for 9 rooms - Time for 2 rooms = (9 * 7) - (2 * 7) hours.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a group of 15 people, including 8 children, dined at a restaurant. The restaurant offers free meals for children, while each adult meal costs $5. The task is to calculate the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total cost for the group, we need to consider the number of adults and children:\n\n1. There are 15 people in total, and 8 of them are children. This means there are 15 - 8 = 7 adults.\n2. Since children eat for free, we only need to calculate the cost for the adults.\n3. Each adult meal costs $5. To find the total cost for the adults, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per meal: 7 adults * $5/adult = $35.\n4. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant is $35.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total cost for the group based on the number of adults and the cost per adult meal. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `group_cost(NumAdults, CostPerAdult, TotalCost)` that calculates the total cost for a group of adults.\n2. Use the fact that there are 8 children in the group to calculate the number of adults as `NumAdults = TotalPeople - NumKids`.\n3. Compute the total cost by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal: `TotalCost is NumAdults * CostPerAdult`.\n4. Implement a rule `restaurant_bill(TotalPeople, NumKids, TotalCost)` that uses the `group_cost` predicate to calculate the total cost for the group.\n5.

The problem entails calculating the total time it will take for the painter to complete the job, given that each room takes a consistent five hours to paint. The painter has already finished painting two rooms, and we are interested in finding out how much additional time is required to complete the remaining rooms.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the time needed for the painter to finish the remaining rooms, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time taken to paint all six rooms:\n   - Total time = Number of rooms * Time per room\n   - Total time = 6 rooms * 5 hours = 30 hours\n\n2. Given that the painter has already painted two rooms, we can find out how much time this accounts for:\n   - Time spent on painted rooms = 2 rooms * 5 hours = 10 hours\n\n3. To find out how much longer the painter needs to work, we subtract the time spent on the painted rooms from the total time:\n   - Time remaining = Total time - Time spent on painted rooms\n\n4. This calculation gives us the additional time required to complete the task.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_time_needed(Rooms, HoursPerRoom, TotalTime)` that calculates the total time needed to paint all rooms, given the number of rooms and the time per room.\n2. Create a predicate `time_spent(PaintedRooms, HoursPerRoom, TimeSpent)` to compute the time spent on the already painted rooms.\n3. Define a predicate `time_remaining(TotalTime, TimeSpent, RemainingTime)` to calculate the remaining time by subtracting the `TimeSpent` from the `TotalTime`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n5. Query the `time_remaining` predicate with the given values to find out how much longer the painter needs to work.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total time needed to paint all rooms\ntotal_time_needed(Rooms, HoursPerRoom, TotalTime) :-\n    TotalTime is Rooms * HoursPerRoom.\n\n% Calculate the time spent on already painted rooms\ntime_spent(PaintedRooms, HoursPerRoom, TimeSpent) :-\n    TimeSpent is PaintedRooms * HoursPerRoom.\n\n% Calculate the remaining time to complete the task\ntime_remaining(TotalTime, TimeSpent, RemainingTime) :-\n    RemainingTime is TotalTime - TimeSpent.\n\n% Query to find out how much longer the painter needs to work\nquery_time_remaining(RemainingTime) :-\n    total_time_needed(6, 5, TotalTime),\n    time_spent(2, 5, TimeSpent),\n    time_remaining(TotalTime, TimeSpent, RemainingTime).\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationships and calculations needed to determine the remaining time for the painter to finish the job. By querying `query_time_remaining(RemainingTime)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the answer in hours.",

        "question": "A trivia team had 11 members total, but during a game 6 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 9 points, how many points were scored total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn a trivia game, a team originally consisted of 11 members, but during the game, some members were absent, and only a few showed up. Specifically, 6 members didn't show up, and we want to calculate the total points scored by the team, knowing that each member who attended the game scored 9 points.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total points scored by the team, we need to consider the number of members who showed up and their individual scores. Given that 6 members didn't show up, we can find the number of members who attended by subtracting 6 from the total number of members (11). Then, we multiply the number of attending members by their individual score (9 points) to calculate the total points scored by the team.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_points(TotalMembers, AbsentMembers, PointsPerMember, TotalTeamPoints)` to calculate the total points scored by the team.\n2. Compute the number of members who showed up by subtracting `AbsentMembers` from `TotalMembers`.\n3. Calculate the total points contributed by the attending members by multiplying the number of attending members by `PointsPerMember`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and unify the result with `TotalTeamPoints`.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate total points\ntotal_points(TotalMembers, AbsentMembers, PointsPerMember, TotalTeamPoints) :-\n    AttendingMembers is TotalMembers - AbsentMembers,\n    TotalTeamPoints is AttendingMembers * PointsPerMember.\n\n% Query to find the total points scored by the team\n% ?- total_points(11, 6, 9, TotalTeamPoints).\n% This query should return the total points scored by the team.\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines a rule that calculates the total points scored by the team based on the total number of members, the number of absent members, and the points scored by each attending member.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a group of 11 people, including 2 children, are dining at a restaurant. The task is to calculate the total cost for the group's meal, considering that adult meals cost $8 each, and children eat for free. We need to determine the number of adult meals and calculate the total expense.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total cost for the group, we need to consider the number of adults and children:\n1. There are 11 people in total, and 2 of them are children. So, there are 11 - 2 = 9 adults.\n2. Each adult meal costs $8. To find the total cost for the adults, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult meal: 9 adults * $8/adult = $72.\n3. Since children eat for free, their meals contribute nothing to the total cost.\n4. The total cost for the group is the cost of the adult meals, which is $72.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total cost based on the given input of the total number of people and the number of children. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `group_cost(TotalPeople, NumKids, Cost)` that calculates the total cost for a group of people, given the total number of people and the number of children in the group.\n2. Calculate the number of adults by subtracting the number of children from the total number of people: `NumAdults is TotalPeople - NumKids`.\n3. Calculate the total cost for adult meals by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal: `AdultCost is NumAdults * AdultMealCost`. We can assume a constant `AdultMealCost` of $8.\n4. The total cost for the group is the sum of the adult meal cost and child meal cost (which is $0 since children eat for free): `TotalCost is AdultCost + ChildCost`.\n5. Implement this logic using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and unification.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost of an adult meal\nadult_meal_cost(8).\n\n% Calculate the total cost for a group\ngroup_cost(TotalPeople, NumKids, TotalCost) :-\n    num_adults(TotalPeople, NumKids, NumAdults),\n    total_adult_cost(NumAdults, AdultCost),\n    total_cost(AdultCost, TotalCost).\n\n% Calculate the number of adults\nnum_adults(TotalPeople, NumKids, NumAdults) :-\n    NumAdults is TotalPeople - NumKids.\n\n% Calculate the total cost for adult meals\ntotal_adult_cost(NumAdults, AdultCost) :-\n    adult_meal_cost(CostPerAdult),\n    AdultCost is NumAdults * CostPerAdult.\n\n% Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost(AdultCost, TotalCost) :-\n    TotalCost is AdultCost.\n\n% Example query\nquery_group_cost(TotalCost) :-\n    group_cost(11, 2, TotalCost).\n```\n\nThis code defines the cost of an adult meal, calculates the number of adults, computes the total cost for adult meals, and finally determines the total cost for the group.

To find out how much money he spent on the ferris wheel ride, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets he used for that ride.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the amount of money Kaleb spent on the ferris wheel ride, we can use the given information:\n1. Total number of tickets bought: 6\n2. Cost of each ticket: $9\n3. Remaining tickets after the ferris wheel ride: 3\n\nWe can calculate the number of tickets Kaleb used for the ferris wheel ride by subtracting the remaining tickets from the total number of tickets bought: 6 tickets - 3 remaining tickets = 3 tickets used for the ferris wheel.\n\nFinally, to find out how much money he spent on the ferris wheel ride, we multiply the number of tickets used by the cost of each ticket: Number of tickets used * Cost per ticket.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the amount of money spent on the ferris wheel ride based on the given input of the total tickets bought, the cost per ticket, and the remaining tickets.

This involves calculating the cost of the tickets he used for that ride.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Adam spent on the ferris wheel ride, we need to determine the cost of the tickets he used. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Given that each ticket costs $9, we can calculate the total cost of all 10 tickets:\n   - Total cost of 10 tickets = 10 tickets * $9/ticket = $90\n2. Since Adam had 3 tickets left after the ferris wheel ride, he must have used the remaining tickets for that ride:\n   - Tickets used for ferris wheel = Total tickets - Remaining tickets = 10 tickets - 3 tickets = 7 tickets\n3. Now, we can calculate the cost of the tickets used for the ferris wheel:\n   - Cost of tickets used = Number of tickets used * Cost per ticket = 7 tickets * $9/ticket = $63\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a logical representation of the situation and use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations. Here's a plan for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `ticket_cost/2` to represent the cost of a single ticket:\n   - `ticket_cost(Tickets, Cost) :- Cost is 9 * Tickets.`\n2. Define a predicate `total_cost/3` to calculate the total cost of all tickets and the cost of the ferris wheel ride based on the number of tickets used:\n   - `total_cost(TotalTickets, RemainingTickets, TotalCost) :- ticket_cost(TotalTickets, TotalCost), ferris_wheel_cost(RemainingTickets, TotalTickets, FerrisWheelCost).`\n3. Define a predicate `ferris_wheel_cost/3` to calculate the cost of the ferris wheel ride by finding the difference between the total cost and the cost of the remaining tickets:\n   - `ferris_wheel_cost(RemainingTickets, TotalTickets, FerrisWheelCost) :- TotalTickets > RemainingTickets, TotalTickets - RemainingTickets # TicketsUsed, ticket_cost(TicketsUsed, FerrisWheelCost).`\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the cost of the ferris wheel ride:\n   - `?- total_cost(10, 3, TotalCost), ferris_wheel_cost(3, 10, FerrisWheelCost).`\n\nThis plan involves defining predicates to represent the cost of tickets and the cost of the ferris wheel ride. By using arithmetic operations and logical relationships, we can calculate the desired cost of the ferris wheel ride based on the number of tickets Adam started with and the number of tickets he had remaining.",

        "question": "There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit. If each player left had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves a group of friends playing a video game online, where each player starts with a certain number of lives. Initially, there were eight friends playing, but three of them decided to quit the game. We want to determine the total number of lives remaining with the players who continued playing. Each player, whether they quit or not, started with the same number of lives.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of lives remaining, we need to consider the lives possessed by the players who continued playing. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: There were 8 friends, and each had 3 lives, resulting in a total of 8 players multiplied by 3 lives each, equaling 24 lives.\n2. **Players Quit**: Three players decided to quit the game. When a player quits, they take their lives with them, so the remaining players now collectively have fewer lives.\n3. **Calculate Remaining Lives**: To find out how many lives are left, we subtract the lives taken by the players who quit. This is done by multiplying the number of players who quit by the number of lives each player has.\n4. **Final Total**: The remaining players now have a collective total of lives, which is the difference between the initial total lives and the lives taken by those who quit.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate `initial_lives(Players, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives)` to calculate the initial total lives based on the number of players and lives per player.\n   - Create a predicate `players_quit(TotalLives, NumQuit, LivesAfterQuit)` to calculate the lives remaining after some players quit. This predicate will subtract the lives taken by those who quit from the initial total lives.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations within the predicates. For example, `TotalLives is Players * LivesPerPlayer.`\n3. **Query**:\n   - Use a query to find the final total lives after some players quit: `?- initial_lives(8, 3, TotalLives), players_quit(TotalLives, 3, LivesAfterQuit).`\n4. **Output**:\n   - The query should output the value of `LivesAfterQuit`, which represents the total number of lives remaining with the players who continued playing.\n\nBy following this plan, we can construct SWI-Prolog code that models the problem and provides the solution through logical inference and arithmetic operations. The code will be structured to calculate the initial total lives, account for players quitting, and determine the final total lives remaining.",

She deleted 21 files, and then she placed the remaining files into folders with a specific capacity of 8 files per folder. The goal is to determine the number of folders Megan ended up with after organizing her remaining files.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of folders Megan needed, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining files after deletion:\n   - Initial number of files = 93\n   - Number of deleted files = 21\n   - Remaining files = Initial files - Deleted files = 93 - 21 = 72 files\n\n2. Determine the number of folders needed for the remaining files:\n   - Given that each folder can hold 8 files, we can calculate the number of folders by dividing the total remaining files by the capacity of each folder.\n   - Number of folders = Total remaining files / Capacity per folder = 72 / 8\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a plan that involves defining predicates to represent the problem constraints and using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n\n1.

Implement the logic:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.

She placed 44 pictures into one album and distributed the remaining pictures into five additional albums. The problem is to determine how many pictures are in each of these albums, including the one with 44 pictures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven:\n- Total pictures uploaded, $P = 79$\n- Pictures in the first album, $A_1 = 44$\n- Number of remaining albums, $n = 5$\n\nTo Find:\n- Pictures in each of the remaining albums, $A_2, A_3, ..., A_n$\n\nSolution:\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures in the five remaining albums: \n   - $P - A_1 =$ Total pictures in 5 albums \n   - $79 - 44 = 35$ pictures\n\n2. Divide the total pictures by the number of albums to find the average number of pictures in each album: \n   - Average pictures per album $= \\frac{35}{5} = 7$ \n\n3.

The goal is to determine the number of players on Paige's team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of players on Paige's team, we can set up and solve an equation based on the given information:\n1. Let 'X' be the number of players on Paige's team, excluding Paige herself.\n2. The total points scored by these 'X' players is 6 points each, so it's calculated as 6*X.\n3. Paige's 11 points, combined with the points from the other 'X' players, should equal the total score of 41 points. So, we have the equation: 11 + 6X = 41.\n4. To find the value of 'X', we isolate it: 6X = 41 - 11, resulting in 6X = 30.\n5. Divide both sides by 6 to solve for 'X': X = 30/6, which simplifies to X = 5.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to find the number of players on Paige's team based on the given scoring information.

However, a librarian takes 10 of those books, leaving Oliver with the remaining books.

Calculate the number of remaining books after the librarian takes 10: 46 books - 10 books = 36 books.\n2. Determine the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of remaining books by the shelf capacity: \n   - Number of shelves = 36 books / 4 books per shelf.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of shelves required based on the initial number of books, the number taken by the librarian, the shelf capacity, and the final number of shelves. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `shelves_needed` that takes the initial number of books (`InitialBooks`), the number of books taken by the librarian (`TakenBooks`), the shelf capacity (`BooksPerShelf`), and the variable for the final number of shelves (`Shelves`):\n   - `shelves_needed(InitialBooks, TakenBooks, BooksPerShelf, Shelves).`\n2.

        "question": "Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friend\u2019s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIsabel has picked 66 flowers, intending to arrange them into bouquets, each containing 8 flowers. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, 10 of the flowers have wilted, rendering them unsuitable for the bouquets. The objective is to determine how many complete bouquets she can still create using the remaining flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers available for making bouquets after some of them have wilted: Total available flowers = Initial number of flowers - Wilted flowers = 66 - 10 = 56.\n2. Determine the number of complete bouquets Isabel can make using the remaining flowers. This is calculated by dividing the total available flowers by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet: Number of bouquets = Total available flowers / Flowers per bouquet = 56 / 8.\n3. Since Isabel cannot create a fraction of a bouquet, we take the floor of the result to find the whole number of bouquets she can make.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of bouquets Isabel can make based on the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `bouquets_made(InitialFlowers, WiltedFlowers, FlowersPerBouquet, TotalBouquets)` that takes the initial number of flowers, the number of wilted flowers, the number of flowers per bouquet, and computes the total number of bouquets that can be made.\n2. Calculate the total available flowers by subtracting the wilted flowers from the initial number of flowers: `TotalAvailable is InitialFlowers - WiltedFlowers`.\n3. Calculate the number of bouquets that can be made by dividing the total available flowers by the number of flowers per bouquet, rounding down to the nearest integer: `TotalBouquets is floor(TotalAvailable / FlowersPerBouquet)`.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMegan had a total of 40 homework problems. She diligently worked on them and completed 26 of those problems. However, she still has two full pages of problems left to tackle. The question now is to determine how many problems are on each of those two pages, assuming that both pages have the same number of problems.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of problems on each page, we can set up an equation based on the given information:\n1. Let 'x' be the number of problems on each page.\n2. We know that Megan has already solved 26 problems, and there are 2 pages left, each with 'x' problems.\n3. The total number of problems remaining can be calculated as 2 pages * 'x' problems per page.\n4. The total number of problems Megan had initially (40) should be equal to the sum of the problems she solved (26) and the problems remaining on the two pages (2 * 'x').\n5. Set up the equation: 26 + 2x = 40.\n6. Solve for 'x' to find the number of problems on each page.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of problems on each page based on the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `problems_per_page` that takes three parameters: the number of problems Megan started with (`TotalProblems`), the number of problems she has already solved (`SolvedProblems`), and the number of problems on each page (`ProblemsPerPage`).\n2. Calculate the total number of remaining problems as the difference between `TotalProblems` and `SolvedProblems`.\n3. Since there are two pages left, multiply `ProblemsPerPage` by 2 to get the total number of problems on both pages.\n4. Set up the equation relating the initial total problems, solved problems, and the product of problems per page and two pages.\n5.

However, some of the flowers have wilted, reducing the total number available for bouquet-making. The problem requires us to calculate the number of bouquets she can create given the total number of flowers, the number of wilted flowers, and the number of flowers in each bouquet.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of bouquets Wendy can make, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers available after some of them wilted: Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total picked flowers.\n2. Divide the total number of flowers available by the number of flowers required for each bouquet to find out how many bouquets she can make.\n3.

The task is to determine how many pictures are in each of these albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many pictures are left after putting 27 in the first album and then distribute the remaining pictures evenly across the other three albums. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining pictures after putting 27 in the first album: Total pictures - Pictures in the first album = Remaining pictures.\n2. Determine the number of pictures in each of the three separate albums: Remaining pictures / Number of albums.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the distribution of pictures among the albums based on the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `picture_distribution` that takes the total number of pictures, the number of pictures in the first album, and the number of separate albums as input parameters.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining pictures after putting some in the first album: `RemainingPictures is TotalPictures - PicturesInFirstAlbum`.\n3. Calculate the number of pictures in each of the separate albums by dividing the remaining pictures evenly: `PicturesPerAlbum is RemainingPictures // NumSeparateAlbums`. Here, `//` represents integer division to ensure a whole number of pictures in each album.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and unify the results with the appropriate variables.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating picture distribution\npicture_distribution(TotalPictures, PicturesInFirstAlbum, NumSeparateAlbums, PicturesPerAlbum) :-\n    RemainingPictures is TotalPictures - PicturesInFirstAlbum,\n    PicturesPerAlbum is RemainingPictures // NumSeparateAlbums.\n\n% Example query to calculate the picture distribution\n% ?- picture_distribution(33, 27, 3, PicturesPerAlbum).\n% This should output the number of pictures in each of the separate albums.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the distribution of pictures among the albums using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing how Prolog can be used to solve real-world problems through rule-based reasoning.",

        "question": "Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily's dodgeball team had an impressive victory, scoring a total of 39 points in the game. Emily herself was the top scorer, contributing 23 points to the team's total score. The rest of the team members each scored 2 points. To find out how many players were on Emily's team, we need to calculate the number of team members whose combined score accounts for the remaining points.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of players on Emily's team, we can set up and solve a simple equation:\n1. Let 'x' be the number of team members (excluding Emily) who each scored 2 points.\n2. The total score of these team members is 2x.\n3. Emily's score was 23 points.\n4. The total score of the team is the sum of Emily's score and the score of the other team members: 23 + 2x = Total Score.\n5. We know the total score is 39 points.\n6. So, we have the equation: 23 + 2x = 39.\n7. Solving for 'x', we get: x = (39 - 23) / 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there were 8 other team members, and including Emily, the team had 9 players.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"team_size\" that takes the parameters \"emily_score,\" \"others_score,\" and \"total_score\" to represent Emily's score, the common score of the other team members, and the total score, respectively.\n2. Calculate \"others_combined_score\" by multiplying \"others_score\" by the number of other team members (x).\n3. Set up the equation relating Emily's score, the other team members' combined score, and the total score: \"emily_score + others_combined_score = total_score.\"\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for 'x' by rearranging the equation and dividing the difference between the total score and Emily's score by the common score of the other team members.\n5. Include assertions or constraints to ensure that the variables are bound to integer values, as we are dealing with discrete counts of team members.\n\nHere's a representation of the Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\nteam_size(EmilyScore, OthersScore, TotalScore, TeamSize) :-\n    OthersCombinedScore is OthersScore * TeamSize,\n    EmilyScore + OthersCombinedScore =:= TotalScore,\n    integer(TeamSize).\n\n% Example query to find the team size\n% ?- team_size(23, 2, 39, TeamSize).\n% Expected output: TeamSize = 9.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the team size by representing the problem with logical relationships and using arithmetic operations to solve for the unknown variable, 'TeamSize'.",

Calculate the final number of attendees by subtracting the number of absentees from the total invited: 47 invited - 7 absentees = 40 attendees.\n2. Determine the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of attendees by the seating capacity of each table (5 people).

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNancy has a collection of vegetable seeds that she wants to plant in her garden. She has a big garden and several small gardens. From her total of 52 seeds, she plants 28 seeds in the big garden and an equal number of seeds in each of her small gardens. To find out the number of small gardens she has, we need to determine how many seeds are allocated to the small gardens and then divide that quantity by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total number of seeds Nancy planted in her small gardens: subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden (28) from the total number of seeds she has (52).\n2. Divide the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden (4) to find out the number of small gardens she has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of small gardens Nancy has based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `small_gardens` that takes three parameters: the total number of seeds Nancy has (`TotalSeeds`), the number of seeds she plants in the big garden (`BigGardenSeeds`), and the number of seeds she plants in each small garden (`SmallGardenSeedsPerGarden`).\n2. Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens by subtracting the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds Nancy has.\n3. Calculate the number of small gardens Nancy has by dividing the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\nsmall_gardens(TotalSeeds, BigGardenSeeds, SmallGardenSeedsPerGarden, NumSmallGardens) :-\n    TotalSmallGardenSeeds is TotalSeeds - BigGardenSeeds,\n    NumSmallGardens is TotalSmallGardenSeeds // SmallGardenSeedsPerGarden.\n\n% Example query to calculate the number of small gardens\n% ?- small_gardens(52, 28, 4, NumSmallGardens).\n% This should output the number of small gardens Nancy has.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of small gardens Nancy has by utilizing simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving basic arithmetic and constraints.",

She placed 27 pictures into one album and distributed the remaining pictures into nine separate albums. The task is to determine how many pictures were in each of these nine albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many pictures were in each of the nine albums, we need to calculate the total number of pictures remaining after the first album and then divide that number equally among the nine albums. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pictures remaining after the first album: 45 pictures uploaded - 27 pictures in the first album = 18 pictures remaining.\n2. Determine the number of pictures in each of the nine albums: Divide the remaining 18 pictures by the 9 albums.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to calculate the distribution of pictures among the nine albums. The steps to create the code are as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `pictures_per_album(TotalPictures, FirstAlbumPictures, RemainingPictures)` that calculates the number of pictures left for the remaining albums after placing `FirstAlbumPictures` into the first album. This rule will subtract `FirstAlbumPictures` from `TotalPictures`.\n2. Define another rule `distribute_to_albums(RemainingPictures, NumAlbums, PicturesPerAlbum)` that calculates how many pictures each of the `NumAlbums` albums will receive. This is calculated by dividing `RemainingPictures` by `NumAlbums`.\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values from the problem: Total pictures uploaded (45), pictures in the first album (27), and the number of remaining albums (9).\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and queries to find the value of `PicturesPerAlbum`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the number of pictures left for the remaining albums\npictures_per_album(TotalPictures, FirstAlbumPictures, RemainingPictures) :-\n    RemainingPictures is TotalPictures - FirstAlbumPictures.\n\n% Distribute pictures to the remaining albums\ndistribute_to_albums(RemainingPictures, NumAlbums, PicturesPerAlbum) :-\n    PicturesPerAlbum is RemainingPictures / NumAlbums.\n\n% Sample query to find the number of pictures in each album\n% ?- pictures_per_album(45, 27, Remaining), distribute_to_albums(Remaining, 9, PicturesPerAlbum).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines rules to calculate the number of pictures left for the remaining albums and to distribute those pictures equally among the specified number of albums.

The task is to determine the number of cages the pet store will use for the remaining puppies. This problem involves basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to find the solution.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. First, calculate the number of remaining puppies after selling 21: 102 - 21 = 81.\n2. Next, to find the number of cages needed, divide the remaining puppies by the capacity of each cage (9): Total cages = 81 / 9.\n3. Since the number of puppies may not be evenly divisible by 9, we need to consider the remainder as well.\n4. The number of cages used will be the quotient of the division, with the potential addition of one more cage if there's a remainder.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to perform the necessary arithmetic calculations and determine the number of cages used.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRoger has 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He starts by putting 48 items in one load. He then wants to divide the remaining clothes into nine equal smaller loads. To find out how many items of clothing can go into each of these small loads, we need to calculate the number of remaining clothes and then divide them equally.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of clothing items in each small load, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining clothes: Total clothes - clothes in the first load = Remaining clothes.\n2. To find the number of items in each small load, divide the remaining clothes by the number of small loads: Remaining clothes / Number of small loads.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of clothing items in each small load. We'll define predicates to handle the calculations and ensure proper relationships between the quantities.\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_clothes(TotalClothes, FirstLoad, Remaining)` that calculates the number of remaining clothes after the first load:\n   ```prolog\n   remaining_clothes(TotalClothes, FirstLoad, Remaining) :-\n       Remaining is TotalClothes - FirstLoad.\n   ```\n2. Define another predicate `small_load_size(Remaining, NumSmallLoads, SmallLoadSize)` to compute the size of each small load:\n   ```prolog\n   small_load_size(Remaining, NumSmallLoads, SmallLoadSize) :-\n       SmallLoadSize is Remaining / NumSmallLoads.\n   ```\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is`) to perform the division and calculate the `SmallLoadSize`.\n4. Query the predicates with the given values to find the size of each small load:\n   ```prolog\n   query_small_load_size(SmallLoadSize) :-\n       remaining_clothes(120, 48, Remaining),\n       small_load_size(Remaining, 9, SmallLoadSize).\n   ```\n\nThis plan outlines a clear approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog, utilizing the language's arithmetic and logical inference capabilities to determine the solution.",

However, some of the flowers have wilted, and she needs to determine how many bouquets she can still make with the remaining fresh flowers. This problem involves basic arithmetic and logical reasoning to find the solution.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the given information: Paige picked 53 flowers, wants to make bouquets with 7 flowers each, and 18 flowers wilted.\n2. Calculate the number of fresh flowers remaining after some wilted: Subtract the wilted flowers from the total picked flowers: 53 - 18 = 35 fresh flowers.\n3. Determine how many bouquets she can make with the remaining fresh flowers: Divide the number of fresh flowers by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet: 35 / 7.\n4. Interpret the result: The division may not yield a whole number, so we need to consider whether Paige can make whole bouquets with the remaining flowers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the number of bouquets Paige can make based on the given information. Our approach is outlined below:\n\n1. Define a predicate `bouquets(TotalFlowers, WiltedFlowers, Bouquets)` that relates the total number of flowers, the number of wilted flowers, and the number of bouquets that can be made.\n2.

        "question": "A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of tables required to accommodate a specific number of attendees at a luncheon. Initially, 24 people were invited, but only 14 showed up. The tables are designed to seat seven individuals each. To find the number of tables needed, we must calculate the number of attendees per table and then determine how many tables are required to accommodate all attendees.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of attendees per table by dividing the total number of attendees (14) by the seating capacity of each table (7). This will give us the average number of attendees per table.\n2. Determine the number of tables required by dividing the total number of attendees (14) by the attendees per table (calculated in step 1). This will provide the minimum number of tables needed to accommodate everyone.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo address this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that capture the relationships and calculations outlined in the analysis:\n\n1. **Define a predicate for calculating attendees per table**:\n   - Parameters: Total attendees, seating capacity per table.\n   - Returns: Attendees per table.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for calculating the number of tables required**:\n   - Parameters: Total attendees, attendees per table.\n   - Returns: Number of tables.\n\n3. **Implement the predicates with the given values**:\n   - Use 14 as the total number of attendees.\n   - Use 7 as the seating capacity per table.\n\n4. **Query the predicates to compute the number of tables needed**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and infer the result.\n\nBy structuring the code this way, we can efficiently compute the number of tables required to accommodate the attendees while adhering to the seating capacity constraint.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca's team won a dodgeball game with a total score of 75 points. Bianca herself scored 45 points, and the remaining players on her team each scored 6 points. The goal is to determine the number of players on Bianca's team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of players on Bianca's team, we can set up and solve a simple equation using the given information:\n\n1. Let 'x' be the number of players on Bianca's team, excluding Bianca herself.\n2. The total points scored by the other players is 6 points per player, or 6x points in total.\n3. The total score of the team is the sum of Bianca's points and the points scored by the other players: 45 (Bianca's points) + 6x (points by other players).\n4. The total score is given as 75 points.\n\nSetting up the equation, we have:\n45 + 6x = 75\n\nNow, we can solve for 'x' to find the number of players on Bianca's team.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of players on Bianca's team based on the given total score and point values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `players_on_team(TotalScore, BiancaScore, PlayerScore, NumPlayers)` that relates the total score, Bianca's score, the score of each other player, and the number of players on the team.\n2. Within the predicate, calculate the contribution of the other players as `PlayerScore * NumPlayers`.\n3. Set up the equation to find the number of players, `NumPlayers`, by subtracting Bianca's score and then dividing by the individual player's score: `(TotalScore - BiancaScore) / PlayerScore`.\n4.

        "question": "Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 40 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJerry initially had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He started by putting 40 items in one load, which means he had 20 items left over (`60 - 40 = 20`). He then decided to split those remaining items into 5 equal loads. To find out how many items are in each of the small loads, we need to divide the remaining 20 items by 5.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved through the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of remaining items after the first load: `RemainingItems = TotalItems - FirstLoad`, where `TotalItems = 60` and `FirstLoad = 40`.\n2. Divide the remaining items by the number of small loads: `ItemsPerSmallLoad = RemainingItems / NumberOfSmallLoads`, where `RemainingItems = 20` and `NumberOfSmallLoads = 5`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of items in each small load based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `items_per_small_load(TotalItems, FirstLoad, NumberOfSmallLoads, ItemsPerSmallLoad)` that calculates the number of items in each small load. This predicate will take the total number of items, the size of the first load, and the number of small loads as input, and it will compute the `ItemsPerSmallLoad`.\n\n2. Implement the logic within the predicate to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - Subtract `FirstLoad` from `TotalItems` to find the `RemainingItems`.\n   - Divide `RemainingItems` by `NumberOfSmallLoads` to find the `ItemsPerSmallLoad`.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicate with the given values from the problem: `TotalItems = 60`, `FirstLoad = 40`, and `NumberOfSmallLoads = 5`.\n\n4.

        "question": "For Halloween Bianca received 32 pieces of candy. She ate 12 pieces then placed the rest into piles with 5 in each pile. How many piles could she make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca received 32 pieces of candy for Halloween. She ate 12 pieces, and then she wanted to distribute the remaining candy evenly into piles, with each pile containing 5 pieces. The problem is to determine how many piles of candy she can make with the remaining pieces.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining pieces of candy after Bianca ate 12. This can be done by subtracting 12 from the total number of pieces she received (32).\n2. Determine the maximum number of piles Bianca can make. This is found by dividing the remaining pieces by the number of pieces in each pile (5).\n3. The result of the division may not be a whole number, so we need to consider the concept of integer division, where the remainder is discarded.\n4. The answer will be the number of piles Bianca can make with the remaining candy, each containing 5 pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of piles Bianca can make based on the given conditions. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_candies(TotalReceived, CandiesAte, Remaining)` that calculates the number of candies remaining after Bianca ate some. This predicate will take the total received and the number of candies she ate as input and output the remaining amount.\n\n2. Define a predicate `num_piles(Remaining, CandiesPerPile, NumPiles)` that computes the number of piles Bianca can make. This predicate will take the remaining candies and the desired number of candies per pile as input and output the number of piles.\n\n3. Implement the predicates using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities for addition and division. Ensure that the division operation uses integer division to discard any remainder.\n\n4.
