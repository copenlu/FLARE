                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nJo-Bob's hot air balloon ride involves alternating periods of ascent and descent based on whether he pulls the lift chain or releases it. The balloon ascends at a rate of 50 feet per minute when the lift chain is pulled and descends at 10 feet per minute when the chain is not being pulled. He pulls the chain for two separate intervals of 15 minutes each and releases it for an interval of 10 minutes in between these periods. The task is to calculate the highest elevation reached during this ride.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the initial ascent: Jo-Bob pulls the chain for 15 minutes, causing the balloon to rise at 50 feet per minute.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n2. Calculate the descent after the first ascent: Jo-Bob releases the chain for 10 minutes, causing the balloon to descend at 10 feet per minute.\n   - Total descent = 10 minutes * 10 feet/minute = 100 feet.\n3. Calculate the second ascent: Jo-Bob again pulls the chain for 15 minutes at the same ascent rate.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n4. Calculate the highest elevation reached by adding the net gain after the first descent to the second ascent.\n   - Highest elevation = first ascent - first descent + second ascent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to model the balloon's behavior during ascent and descent and to calculate the highest elevation reached. The steps to construct the code are:\n\n1. Define predicates for ascent and descent that calculate the total change in height based on time and rate:\n   - `ascent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n   - `descent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n2. Define a predicate `balloon_ride` that calculates the highest elevation reached by using the ascent and descent predicates and considering the sequence of actions:\n   - `balloon_ride(HighestElevation) :- ascent(15, 50, Ascent1), descent(10, 10, Descent1), ascent(15, 50, Ascent2), HighestElevation is Ascent1 - Descent1 + Ascent2.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the highest elevation:\n   - `?- balloon_ride(HighestElevation).`\n4. The code will use logical inference to determine the total heights for each ascent and descent phase and combine these to find the highest elevation reached.\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to model and solve the problem based on the given conditions of the balloon's ascent and descent rates and the times Jo-Bob pulls or releases the chain."

The task is to calculate the total cost of the meal and then determine how much each friend must pay if the bill is split equally among them. The items ordered include a Taco Salad, Dave's Single hamburgers, sets of french fries, and cups of peach lemonade, each with specific costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much each friend pays, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each item:\n   - Taco Salad: $10\n   - Dave's Single hamburgers: 5 orders at $5 each = $25\n   - French fries: 4 sets at $2.50 each = $10\n   - Peach lemonade: 5 cups at $2 each = $10\n\n2. Sum up these costs to get the total bill:\n   - Total bill = $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (Hamburgers) + $10 (Fries) + $10 (Lemonade) = $55\n\n3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend pays:\n   - Each friend pays = Total bill / 5\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_bill\" that takes variables for each item's cost and the number of friends.\n2. Assign constants to the costs of individual items (e.g., cost of Taco Salad, cost of a hamburger).\n3. Compute the total cost for each type of item by multiplying the unit cost with the quantity ordered.\n4. Sum up all these total costs to get the final bill.\n5. Divide the final bill by the number of friends to determine how much each friend pays.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define costs of items\nitem_cost(taco_salad, 10).\nitem_cost(hamburger, 5).\nitem_cost(fries, 2.5).\nitem_cost(lemonade, 2).\n\n% Calculate total cost of an item type\ntotal_item_cost(Item, Quantity, TotalCost) :-\n    item_cost(Item, CostPerItem),\n    TotalCost is CostPerItem * Quantity.\n\n% Calculate the total bill and how much each friend pays\ncalculate_bill(NumFriends, EachPays) :-\n    total_item_cost(taco_salad, 1, TotalTacoSalad),\n    total_item_cost(hamburger, 5, TotalHamburgers),\n    total_item_cost(fries, 4, TotalFries),\n    total_item_cost(lemonade, 5, TotalLemonade),\n    TotalBill is TotalTacoSalad + TotalHamburgers + TotalFries + TotalLemonade,\n    EachPays is TotalBill / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost of each item, calculates the total cost for each type of item based on the quantity, sums these to get the total bill, and finally computes the amount each friend pays by dividing the total bill by the number of friends."

She captured a specific number of photos at each place, and then she deleted some of them. The problem involves calculating the total number of photos she took and then determining how many were left after the deletion.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many vacation photos Megan has left, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Subtract the number of deleted photos to find how many are left:\n   - Photos left = Total photos taken - Deleted photos\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define predicates for the number of photos taken at each location:\n   - `zoo_photos(15).`\n   - `museum_photos(18).`\n2. Create a predicate to calculate the total number of photos taken:\n   - `total_photos(Total) :- zoo_photos(ZooPhotos), museum_photos(MuseumPhotos), Total is ZooPhotos + MuseumPhotos.`\n3.

After a week, she has colored a total of 44 pictures from both books combined. The problem is to determine how many pictures she still needs to color.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many pictures Rachel has yet to color, we can perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures in both coloring books:\n   - Total pictures = Number of pictures in book 1 + Number of pictures in book 2\n   - Total pictures = 23 + 32 = 55\n\n2. Given that she has already colored 44 pictures, we can find the number of remaining pictures:\n   - Remaining pictures = Total pictures - Colored pictures\n   - Remaining pictures = 55 - 44\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to calculate the total number of pictures in both books and then determine the number of pictures left to color. Here's an outline:\n\n1. Define predicates for calculating the total number of pictures and the remaining pictures:\n   - `total_pictures(NumPics1, NumPics2, TotalPics) :- TotalPics is NumPics1 + NumPics2.`\n   - `remaining_pictures(TotalPics, ColoredPics, RemainingPics) :- RemainingPics is TotalPics - ColoredPics.`\n2. Create a predicate `coloring_books` that uses the above predicates to calculate the remaining pictures:\n   - `coloring_books(RemainingPics) :- total_pictures(23, 32, TotalPics), remaining_pictures(TotalPics, 44, RemainingPics).`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the number of pictures Rachel has left to color:\n   - `?- coloring_books(RemainingPics).`\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nChloe played a trivia game consisting of three rounds. In the first and second rounds, she scored positive points, while in the last round, she lost some points. The task is to calculate her final score, or the number of points she had at the end of the game, by considering the points gained and lost in each round.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Chloe's final score, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the points gained in the first two rounds:\n   - First round: 40 points\n   - Second round: 50 points\n2. Recognize that in the last round, she lost 4 points.\n3. Calculate the net gain or loss in the last round by subtracting the lost points from zero (representing no change):\n   - Last round: 0 - 4 points = -4 points\n4. Sum the points from the first two rounds and then add the net gain/loss from the last round to find the final score.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate Chloe's final score by considering the points gained and lost in each round:\n\n1. Define a predicate `round_score` that represents the points gained or lost in each round. It will take the round number and the score change as arguments:\n   - `round_score(Round, ScoreChange).`\n2. Define the facts for each round's score change:\n   - `fact(round_score(1, 40)).`\n   - `fact(round_score(2, 50)).`\n   - `fact(round_score(3, -4)).`\n3. Define a predicate `final_score` that calculates the sum of score changes from all rounds to determine the final score:\n   - `final_score(FinalScore) :- findall(ScoreChange, round_score(_, ScoreChange), ScoreChanges), sum_list(ScoreChanges, FinalScore).`\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the final score:\n   - `?- final_score(FinalScore).`\n5. The code will use logical inference to retrieve the score changes from each round and then apply arithmetic operations to calculate the final score.\n\nThis plan utilizes Prolog's fact database to store the score changes for each round and then retrieves and processes this information to compute the final score.",

However, out of their collective harvest of 41 carrots, only 16 turned out to be good. The task is to determine the number of bad carrots they ended up with.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of bad carrots, we can use the information provided:\n\n- Total carrots picked = Bianca's carrots + Mother's carrots = 26 + 15 = 41\n- Good carrots = 16\n- Bad carrots = Total carrots picked - Good carrots\n\nTherefore, the number of bad carrots is calculated as:\n\n- Bad carrots = 41 - 16 = 25\n\nSo, Bianca and her mother had 25 bad carrots.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a predicate that calculates the number of bad carrots based on the input values of carrots picked by Bianca and her mother, and the number of good carrots. Here's an outline for the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `bad_carrots(BiancaCarrots, MomCarrots, GoodCarrots, BadCarrots)` that relates the number of carrots picked by Bianca and her mom to the number of good carrots and computes the number of bad carrots.\n2. Calculate the total number of carrots picked by summing Bianca's carrots and her mother's carrots.\n3. Subtract the number of good carrots from the total carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots.\n4.

He starts by purchasing 21 games from a friend, indicating his enthusiasm for building a diverse collection.

However, misfortune strikes as he discovers that not all of his acquisitions are functional\u2014a total of 23 games, unfortunately, do not work. The question now arises: How many operable games has John accumulated throughout this endeavor?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of functional games John ends up with, we must consider his purchases and the non-working games:\n\n1. **Total Games Purchased**: John bought 21 games from a friend and added 8 more from the garage sale, resulting in 29 games in total.\n2. **Non-Working Games**: Unfortunately, 23 of these games are non-functional, which means they don't contribute to his collection of playable games.\n3. **Calculation**: To find the number of good games, we subtract the number of non-working games from the total games purchased: Total Games - Non-Working Games = Good Games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nImplementing this problem in SWI-Prolog involves defining predicates that represent the given conditions and performing the necessary arithmetic operations to find the solution:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_games_purchased/2`: This predicate calculates the total number of games John bought.\n   - `non_working_games/1`: This predicate represents the number of games that didn't work.\n   - `good_games/2`: This predicate computes the number of good games John ended up with.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the given information.\n   - Perform arithmetic operations within the predicates to carry out the necessary calculations.\n   - Chain the predicates together to derive the final answer, utilizing the relationships between the number of total games, non-working games, and good games.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the known values for the total games purchased and non-working games to verify that the output aligns with the expected number of good games John acquired.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with distinct predicates for each aspect of the problem, we can effectively model the scenario and provide a clear solution through logical reasoning and arithmetic operations.",

We need to calculate the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with by finding the difference between the total ordered apples and the apples wanted by the students.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of extra apples, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of apples ordered: 43 red apples + 32 green apples = 75 apples.\n2. Determine the number of apples wanted by the students: Since only 2 students wanted fruit, we can assume each student wanted one apple, resulting in 2 apples wanted.\n3. Calculate the number of extra apples: Subtract the number of apples wanted by the students from the total number of ordered apples: 75 ordered apples - 2 wanted apples = 73 extra apples.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the problem constraints and use them to calculate the number of extra apples. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define predicates:\n   - `total_ordered_apples(TotalRed, TotalGreen, Total)` to calculate the total number of ordered apples based on the number of red and green apples.\n   - `students_wanting_fruit(NumStudents, ApplesPerStudent, TotalWanted)` to determine the total number of apples wanted by the students, assuming each student wants one apple.\n   - `extra_apples(TotalOrdered, TotalWanted, Extra)` to calculate the number of extra apples by finding the difference between the total ordered apples and the apples wanted by the students.\n2.

Specifically, there were 39 girls and 4 boys participating in the tryouts. However, only 26 students out of the total were called back, indicating that some students did not make the cut. The task is to determine how many students did not make the team.\n\n### Analysis: \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students who tried out for the basketball team and then subtract the number of students who were called back:\n\n- Total students trying out = Number of girls + Number of boys \n- Students who didn't make the cut = Total students trying out - Students called back\n\nBy substituting the given values and performing the calculations, we can find the answer.\n\n### Plan: \n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the problem constraints and use them to calculate the final answer. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define predicates:\n   - `total_students(Girls, Boys, Total)` to calculate the total number of students trying out based on the number of girls and boys.\n   - `students_cut(Total, CalledBack, Cut)` to determine the number of students who didn't make the cut by subtracting the number of students called back from the total.\n\n2. Implement the logic:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.\n   - `Total is Girls + Boys` to calculate the sum of girls and boys.\n   - `Cut is Total - CalledBack` to find the number of students who didn't make the cut.\n\n3. Test the implementation:\n   - Input the given values of girls, boys, and students called back to find the number of students who didn't make the team.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total number of students trying out\ntotal_students(Girls, Boys, Total) :-\n    Total is Girls + Boys.\n\n% Calculate the number of students who didn't make the cut\nstudents_cut(Total, CalledBack, Cut) :-\n    Cut is Total - CalledBack.\n\n% Query the number of students who didn't make the team\nquery_cut(Cut) :-\n    total_students(39, 4, Total),\n    students_cut(Total, 26, Cut).\n```\n\nThis code defines the necessary predicates and uses arithmetic operations to calculate the final answer. By querying `query_cut(Cut)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of students who didn't make the cut based on the given inputs.",

        "question": "Carol was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 17 points and in the second round she scored 6 points. In the last round she lost 16 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn a trivia game, Carol's scores varied across different rounds. She started strong in the first round, scoring 17 points. However, in the second round, her performance dipped, and she earned only 6 points. The game took an unfortunate turn in the last round, where she lost 16 points. To determine her final score, we need to calculate the net sum of her scores across all three rounds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find Carol's final score, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the scores from each round:\n   - First round score: 17 points\n   - Second round score: 6 points\n   - Last round score: -16 points (as she lost 16 points)\n\n2. Calculate the sum of the scores from the first and second rounds:\n   17 points + 6 points = 23 points\n\n3. Add the score from the last round to the sum of the first two rounds:\n   23 points + (-16 points) = Final score\n\n4. Determine Carol's final score by interpreting the result:\n   If the final result is positive, that will be her total score at the end of the game. If it's negative, she may have a score of zero or a deficit.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Carol's final score based on her scores in the three rounds. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate `final_score/3` that takes Carol's scores from the three rounds as input and computes her final score.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`) to perform calculations.\n\n3. **Rules**:\n   - Create rules to calculate the sum of the first and second round scores.\n   - Add the last round score to the sum of the first two rounds to get the final score.\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Input Carol's scores from each round to verify the correctness of the implementation.\n\n5. **Sample Code**:\n\n```prolog\nfinal_score(round1, round2, final) :-\n    round1 + round2 + last_round = final.\n\n% Sample query\nquery_final_score(Final) :-\n    final_score(17, 6, -16, Final).\n```\n\nIn the code above, we define a rule `final_score/3` to calculate the final score based on the scores from the three rounds. The sample query `query_final_score/1` demonstrates how to use the rule to find Carol's final score given her scores in each round.",

Current balance: To find out how much he has now, subtract the amount spent on the game ($34) from his total after receiving birthday money ($49).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `final_balance(InitialAmount, ReceivedAmount, SpentAmount, FinalBalance)` that relates the initial amount of money, the additional amount received, the amount spent, and the final balance.\n2. Set `InitialAmount` to 29 to represent the money Roger had at the beginning.\n3. Calculate the total amount after receiving birthday money by adding `InitialAmount` and `ReceivedAmount` (20 in this case).\n4. Compute `FinalBalance` by subtracting `SpentAmount` (34 for the game) from the total amount after receiving birthday money.\n5. Query the `final_balance` predicate with the given values to find Roger's final balance.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate final balance\nfinal_balance(InitialAmount, ReceivedAmount, SpentAmount, FinalBalance) :-\n    TotalAfterBirthday is InitialAmount + ReceivedAmount,\n    FinalBalance is TotalAfterBirthday - SpentAmount.\n\n% Query to find Roger's final balance\nquery_final_balance(FinalBalance) :-\n    final_balance(29, 20, 34, FinalBalance).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine Roger's final balance. By querying `query_final_balance(FinalBalance)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the amount of money Roger has left after his birthday and purchase.",

        "question": "Edward started his own lawn mowing business. In the spring he made 2 dollars mowing lawns and in the summer he made 27 dollars. If he had to spend 5 dollars buying supplies, how much money did he end up with?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEdward has started a lawn-mowing business, and he wants to calculate his earnings after a period of work. He made $2 during the spring and $27 during the summer. However, he also had to spend $5 on buying supplies. The task is to determine his final earnings after accounting for this expense.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Edward ended up with, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total income by summing up the earnings from spring and summer: $2 + $27.\n2. Subtract the amount he spent on supplies ($5) from the total income.\n3. The result will give us the final amount of money Edward has left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n1. Define predicates to represent the income from spring and summer:\n   ```prolog\n   spring_income(Amount) :- Amount is 2.\n   summer_income(Amount) :- Amount is 27.\n   ```\n2. Create a predicate to calculate the total income by summing up the spring and summer earnings:\n   ```prolog\n   total_income(Spring, Summer, Total) :- Total is Spring + Summer.\n   ```\n3. Define a predicate to represent the expense on supplies:\n   ```prologic\n   supplies_expense(Amount) :- Amount is 5.\n   ```\n4. Create a predicate to calculate the final amount of money left after subtracting the supplies expense from the total income:\n   ```prolog\n   final_amount(Total, Expense, Remaining) :- Remaining is Total - Expense.\n   ```\n5.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Identify the initial quantities:\n   - Number of Siamese cats = 36\n   - Number of house cats = 18\n   - Total initial cats = 36 + 18 = 54\n2.

Out of these 69 books, 16 were used, which leaves 69 - 16 = 53 new books.\n\nSo, Victor bought 53 new books in total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a plan with the following steps:\n\n1. Define predicates to represent the given information:\n   - total_books(Adventure, Mystery, Total) - relates the number of adventure and mystery books to the total books.\n   - used_books(Total, Used) - relates the total number of books to the number of used books.\n2. Calculate the total number of books Victor bought by summing up the adventure and mystery books:\n   - TotalBooks is AdventureBooks + MysteryBooks.\n3. Subtract the number of used books from the total books to find the number of new books:\n   - NewBooks is TotalBooks - UsedBooks.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n5. Define a rule, e.g., \"victor_new_books(Adventure, Mystery, Used, New),\" to encapsulate the relationships and calculations.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_books(Adventure, Mystery, Total) :- Total is Adventure + Mystery.\nused_books(Total, Used) :- Total >= Used.\n\nvictor_new_books(Adventure, Mystery, Used, New) :-\n    total_books(Adventure, Mystery, Total),\n    used_books(Total, Used),\n    New is Total - Used.\n```\n\nThis code defines predicates to calculate the total number of books and to ensure that the number of used books doesn't exceed the total books. Finally, it computes the number of new books by subtracting the used books from the total.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley took a certain number of pictures at the zoo and a fewer number at the museum during her vacation. She then deleted some of these pictures. We are asked to determine the total number of pictures she has remaining from her vacation after the deletion. This problem involves basic arithmetic operations and can be solved using SWI-Prolog by defining predicates that represent the relationships between the numbers of pictures taken, deleted, and remaining.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many pictures Haley has left from her vacation, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures she took during her vacation: sum of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.\n2. Subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total to find out how many pictures are remaining.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_pictures(Zoo, Museum, Total)` that calculates the total number of pictures taken by adding the pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.\n2. Define a predicate `remaining_pictures(Total, Deleted, Remaining)` that computes the number of pictures remaining after some pictures have been deleted.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform addition and subtraction operations.\n4. Query the `remaining_pictures` predicate with the given values to solve for the number of pictures Haley has left.\n\nHere's the outline of the Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_pictures(Zoo, Museum, Total) :- Total is Zoo + Museum.\n\nremaining_pictures(Total, Deleted, Remaining) :- Remaining is Total - Deleted.\n\nhaleys_vacation_pics(Zoo, Museum, Deleted, Remaining) :-\n    total_pictures(Zoo, Museum, Total),\n    remaining_pictures(Total, Deleted, Remaining).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates that represent the relationships between the numbers of pictures taken, deleted, and remaining.

This problem involves calculating the total number of pictures taken and then subtracting the number of deleted pictures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pictures taken**:\n   - Sum the number of pictures taken at the zoo (49) and the museum (8) to find the total number of pictures.\n\n2. **Subtract the number of deleted pictures**:\n   - From the total number of pictures, subtract the count of deleted pictures (38) to determine how many pictures Nancy still has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define predicates that represent the problem constraints and then query them to find the solution.\n\n1. **Define a predicate for the total number of pictures taken**:\n   - This predicate will be represented by the number of pictures taken at the zoo and the museum.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for the number of deleted pictures**:\n   - This predicate will be a fact representing the number of pictures Nancy deleted.\n\n3. **Define a predicate to calculate the remaining number of pictures**:\n   - This predicate will subtract the number of deleted pictures from the total number of pictures taken.\n\n4. **Query SWI-Prolog to find the solution**:\n   - Use Prolog's inference rules to calculate the remaining number of pictures based on the defined predicates and their relationships.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the SWI-Prolog code structure:\n\n1. **Predicate for total pictures**:\n   ```prolog\n   total_pictures(Total) :-\n       zoo_pictures(ZooCount),\n       museum_pictures(MuseumCount),\n       Total is ZooCount + MuseumCount.\n   ```\n\n2. **Predicate for deleted pictures**:\n   ```prolog\n   deleted_pictures(38).\n   ```\n\n3. **Predicate for remaining pictures**:\n   ```prolog\n   remaining_pictures(Remaining) :-\n       total_pictures(Total),\n       deleted_pictures(Deleted),\n       Remaining is Total - Deleted.\n   ```\n\n4. **Query SWI-Prolog**:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- remaining_pictures(Remaining).\n   ```\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog.

The result, X, will be the number of good games Ned has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the total number of games acquired and then determine the number of good games by subtracting the non-working games. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_games_acquired(FriendGames, GarageSaleGames, TotalGames)` that calculates the sum of games acquired from the friend and the garage sale.\n2. Define another predicate `good_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames)` that calculates the number of good games by subtracting the non-working games from the total games.\n3. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and unify the result with `GoodGames`.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate for total games acquired\ntotal_games_acquired(FriendGames, GarageSaleGames, TotalGames) :-\n    TotalGames is FriendGames + GarageSaleGames.\n\n% Define the predicate for calculating good games\ngood_games(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, GoodGames) :-\n    GoodGames is TotalGames - NonWorkingGames.\n\n% Example query to find the number of good games\n% ?- total_games_acquired(50, 27, TotalGames), good_games(TotalGames, 74, GoodGames).\n% This should output the number of good games Ned has.\n```\n\nThis plan leverages Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to calculate the number of good games Ned acquired. The code defines predicates that represent the relationships between the variables, allowing us to find the desired solution efficiently.",

        "question": "A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 33 books, but then put 2 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe book store initially had 41 books in the bargain bin. They sold 33 books, which decreased the number of books in the bin. However, they then added 2 more books to the bin. To find out the final count of books in the bin, we need to consider the number of books sold and the additional books added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Start with the initial count of 41 books in the bin.\n2. Subtract the number of books sold (33) from the initial count.\n3. Add the number of books added back to the bin (2) to the remaining count.\n4. The final result will be the new count of books in the bin.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final count of books in the bin based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_count(Count)` to represent the initial number of books in the bin (41).\n2. Define a predicate `books_sold(Sold)` to represent the number of books sold (33).\n3. Define a predicate `books_added(Added)` to represent the number of books added back to the bin (2).\n4. Create a rule `final_count(Final)` to calculate the final count of books in the bin by subtracting the books sold from the initial count and then adding the books added.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and unify the result with `Final`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_count(41).\nbooks_sold(33).\nbooks_added(2).\n\nfinal_count(Final) :-\n    initial_count(Count),\n    books_sold(Sold),\n    books_added(Added),\n    Final is Count - Sold + Added.\n\n% Example query to calculate the final count\n% ?- final_count(FinalCount).\n% Expected output: FinalCount = 10\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the final count of books in the bargain bin by considering the initial count, the number of books sold, and the number of books added back. It demonstrates how Prolog can be used to solve basic arithmetic problems through logical rules and inference.",

During the year, 18 students left, and simultaneously, 14 new students joined the class.

This involves subtracting the number of students who left from the number of new students who joined and then adding or subtracting this net change from the initial number of students.\n\n### Analysis: \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations: \n1. Find the net change in the number of students by subtracting the number of students who left from the number of new students who joined: \nNet Change = New Students - Left Students \n2. Add the net change to the initial number of students to find the final count: \nFinal Number of Students = Initial Number of Students + Net Change \n\n### Plan: \n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a structured plan with the following steps: \n1. Define a predicate `initial_students(Start, Count)` to represent the initial number of students, where `Start` indicates the starting period, and `Count` is the number of students at the beginning. \n2. Define another predicate `net_change(Left, Joined, Change)` to calculate the net change in the number of students. This predicate will take the number of students who left and the number of new students who joined as input and compute the net change. \n3. Create a rule `final_student_count(Start, End, Count)` to find the final number of students in the fourth grade. This rule will utilize the `initial_students/2` and `net_change/3` predicates to calculate the final count based on the starting period and the net change. \n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this: \n\n```prolog\ninitial_students(start, Count) :- Count is 33.\n\nnet_change(Left, Joined, Change) :- \n    Change is Joined - Left.\n\nfinal_student_count(Start, End, Count) :- \n    initial_students(Start, Initial),\n    net_change(Left, Joined, Change),\n    End is Start + Change,\n    Count is Initial + Change.\n\n/* \nTo find the final number of students:\n?- final_student_count(start, end, FinalCount).\n*/\n``` \n\nIn this plan, we define predicates to represent the initial student count, calculate the net change, and determine the final student count.

To determine the final count, we need to calculate the net change in her lives: the loss of 14 lives and the gain of 27 lives, all starting from the initial 43 lives.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Subtract the number of lives lost (14) from the initial number of lives (43) to find out how many lives she has left after the hard part of the game.\n2. Add the number of extra lives gained (27) to the result of step one to calculate the total number of lives she has after the next level.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining predicates to represent the initial lives, lives lost, extra lives gained, and the final count of lives. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_lives(Lives)` to represent the number of lives Tiffany starts with.\n2. Define a predicate `lose_lives(Lost, Remaining, Initial)` to represent the loss of lives. `Lost` is the number of lives lost, `Remaining` is the number of lives left, and `Initial` is the starting number of lives.\n3. Define a predicate `gain_lives(Gained, NewTotal, OldTotal)` to represent gaining extra lives. `Gained` is the number of extra lives, `NewTotal` is the updated total, and `OldTotal` is the previous total.\n4. Define a predicate `final_lives(Lives)` to represent the total number of lives Tiffany has after the calculations.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and find the final number of lives.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_lives(43).\n\nlose_lives(Lost, Remaining, Initial) :-\n    Remaining is Initial - Lost.\n\ngain_lives(Gained, NewTotal, OldTotal) :-\n    NewTotal is OldTotal + Gained.\n\nfinal_lives(Lives) :-\n    initial_lives(Initial),\n    lose_lives(14, AfterLoss, Initial),\n    gain_lives(27, Lives, AfterLoss).\n\n% Sample query to find the final number of lives\n% ?- final_lives(FinalLives).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates to represent the different stages of the problem.

A decrease of 10 people leaving the line.\n2. An increase of 5 people joining the line.\n\nTo find the net change, we subtract the number of people who left from those who joined: 5 - 10 = -5.

        "question": "A book store had 4 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 3 books, but then put 10 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nInitially, the book store had 4 books in the bargain bin. They sold 3 books, which decreased the number of books in the bin. However, they then added 10 more books to the bin, resulting in an increase in the total number of books. To find out the final count of books in the bin, we need to consider the number of books sold and added.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Start with the initial number of books in the bin (4 books).\n2. Subtract the number of books sold (3 books) from the initial count.\n3. Add the number of new books added to the bin (10 books) to the remaining count after step 2.\n4. The final result will give us the total number of books now in the bin.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a simple program that calculates the final number of books in the bin. Our plan will involve defining predicates to represent the initial state, the sale of books, the addition of new books, and the final count:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_books(Count)` to represent the initial number of books in the bin (4 books).\n2. Define a predicate `sell_books(Sold, Remaining)` to simulate the sale of books. It will take the number of books sold (`Sold`) and calculate the remaining books (`Remaining`).\n3. Define a predicate `add_books(Added, NewTotal)` to represent adding new books to the bin. It will take the number of new books added (`Added`) and calculate the new total (`NewTotal`).\n4. Finally, use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the answer by chaining the predicates and performing the necessary arithmetic calculations.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_books(4).\n\nsell_books(Sold, Remaining) :-\n    initial_books(Initial),\n    Remaining is Initial - Sold.\n\nadd_books(Added, NewTotal) :-\n    RemainingBooks is 3, % Fact: 3 books remaining after selling\n    sell_books(3, RemainingBooks),\n    NewTotal is RemainingBooks + Added.\n\nbargain_bin_count(Count) :-\n    add_books(10, Count).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we first define the initial state with `initial_books/1`. Then, we use `sell_books/2` to calculate the remaining books after selling. The fact that 3 books were sold is represented by `RemainingBooks is 3`. Next, we define `add_books/2` to calculate the new total after adding more books. Finally, we use `bargain_bin_count/1` to find the answer by querying the number of books in the bin after adding 10 new books.",

        "question": "At the arcade Victor won 46 tickets. If he spent 27 tickets on a beanie and later won 39 more tickets, how many would he have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVictor's arcade outing resulted in him winning 46 tickets initially. He then spent some of his tickets, 27 to be precise, on a beanie. Subsequently, he continued playing and won 39 more tickets. To find out how many tickets Victor has in the end, we need to calculate the total number of tickets he accumulated and then subtract the ones he spent.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the initial state: Victor starts with 46 tickets.\n2. Spending tickets: He spends 27 tickets to purchase the beanie.\n3. Winning more tickets: Victor wins an additional 39 tickets.\n4. Calculate the final ticket count: To find the total number of tickets Victor has after his spending and subsequent winnings, we add the initial tickets to the new winnings and then subtract the amount he spent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates and rules to calculate the final number of tickets Victor possesses. Our plan will involve creating predicates for the initial state, spending tickets, winning more tickets, and calculating the final ticket count.\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - `initial_tickets(Tickets)` to represent the number of tickets Victor won at the start.\n   - `spend_tickets(Spent, Remaining)` to calculate the tickets left after spending a certain amount.\n   - `win_more_tickets(Initial, NewTickets, TotalTickets)` to compute the total tickets after winning more.\n   - `final_ticket_count(TotalTickets)` to represent the final number of tickets Victor has.\n\n2. **Logic and Rules**:\n   - For the `initial_tickets/1` predicate, we assert that Victor started with 46 tickets.\n   - The `spend_tickets/2` predicate will be defined to subtract the spent tickets from the initial tickets to find the remaining tickets.\n   - `win_more_tickets/3` will add the new tickets won to the remaining tickets to calculate the updated total.\n   - `final_ticket_count/1` will be derived by chaining the previous predicates to get the final ticket count.\n\n3. **Code Outline**:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_tickets(46).\n\nspend_tickets(Spent, Remaining) :- InitialTickets is 46, Remaining is InitialTickets - Spent.\n\nwin_more_tickets(Initial, NewTickets, TotalTickets) :- TotalTickets is Initial + NewTickets.\n\nfinal_ticket_count(TotalTickets) :-\n    initial_tickets(Initial),\n    spend_tickets(27, Remaining),\n    win_more_tickets(Remaining, 39, TotalTickets).\n```\n\nBy structuring the code in this manner, we can effectively model Victor's ticket winnings and expenditures, leading to the calculation of his final ticket count.",

        "question": "Chloe picked 48 carrots from her garden. If she threw out 45 of them and then picked 42 more the next day, how many carrots would she have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nChloe picked carrots from her garden over two days. On the first day, she picked 48 carrots but threw out 45 of them, keeping only a small portion. The next day, she picked 42 more carrots. We want to calculate the total number of carrots Chloe has at the end of these two days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of carrots Chloe has, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. **Initial Picking**: Chloe starts with 48 carrots on the first day.\n2. **Discarded Carrots**: She throws out 45 carrots, leaving her with only a small number.\n3. **Remaining Carrots after First Day**: To find out how many carrots she has left after discarding, we subtract the discarded amount from the initial picking: 48 - 45 = 3.\n4. **Second Day Picking**: On the next day, she picks 42 more carrots.\n5. **Total Carrots**: To calculate the overall total, we add the remaining carrots from the first day to the second day's picking: 3 + 42.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the total number of carrots Chloe has at the end of the two days. The plan involves creating rules to represent each step of the analysis and using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_picking(Count)` to represent the number of carrots Chloe picked on the first day.\n   - `discarded_carrots(Count)` to indicate the number of carrots she threw out.\n   - `remaining_carrots(Count)` to calculate the carrots left after discarding.\n   - `second_day_picking(Count)` to represent the number of carrots picked on the next day.\n   - `total_carrots(Count)` to compute the overall total carrots Chloe has.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above. For example, `initial_picking(48).`\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations. For instance, `remaining_carrots(Count) :- initial_picking(Initial), discarded_carrots(Discarded), Count is Initial - Discarded.`\n3. **Compute Total**:\n   - Chain the predicates together to derive the final total. This will involve invoking the `total_carrots` predicate, which depends on the values from the previous steps.\n\n4. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `total_carrots` predicate to retrieve the overall count of carrots Chloe has. The expected answer is 45, so we can verify the correctness of the Prolog code through this test.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the analysis, we can effectively compute the total number of carrots Chloe has at the end of the two days.",

However, he then went and purchased a large pack of 36 new socks. The task is to determine the total number of socks Sam has now, taking into account the addition and subtraction of socks.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of socks Sam has now, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of socks Sam had: 10 socks.\n2. Subtract the number of old socks he threw away: 10 - 3 = 7 socks remaining.\n3. Add the number of new socks he bought: 7 + 36 = 43 socks.\n\nSo, after throwing away old socks and buying new ones, Sam now has a total of 43 socks.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the final number of socks Sam has. The plan involves creating rules to represent the initial state, the removal of old socks, the addition of new socks, and finally, the total count.\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_socks(Count)` to represent the number of socks Sam started with.\n2. Create a predicate `remove_old_socks(Initial, Removed, Remaining)` to calculate the number of socks remaining after throwing away old ones.\n3. Define another predicate `add_new_socks(Remaining, New, Total)` to calculate the total number of socks after buying new ones.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform addition and subtraction within the predicates.\n5. Chain the predicates together to solve for the final count: `initial_socks(Initial), remove_old_socks(Initial, Removed, Remaining), add_new_socks(Remaining, New, Total)`.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_socks(10).\n\nremove_old_socks(Initial, Removed, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is Initial - Removed.\n\nadd_new_socks(Remaining, New, Total) :-\n    Total is Remaining + New.\n\nsam_socks(Total) :-\n    initial_socks(Initial),\n    remove_old_socks(Initial, Removed, Remaining),\n    add_new_socks(Remaining, New, Total).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates to handle each step of the calculation, utilizing Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca is updating her mp3 player's song collection. She starts with 34 songs, removes some old songs, and then adds new ones. To find out the final count, we need to account for these changes - the number of songs removed and the number of new songs added. This problem involves basic arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Initial Song Count: Bianca has **34 songs** on her mp3 player at the beginning.\n2. Song Deletion: She deletes **14 old songs**, reducing the count.\n3. New Song Addition: Bianca then adds **44 new songs**, increasing the total count.\n4. Final Song Count Calculation: To find the total number of songs after these changes, we need to subtract the deleted songs and then add the new songs to the initial count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem will involve defining predicates to represent each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to calculate the final song count. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate `initial_song_count/1` to represent the initial number of songs (34).\n   - Create a predicate `deleted_songs/1` to represent the number of songs Bianca deleted (14).\n   - Introduce a predicate `added_songs/1` to represent the number of new songs Bianca added (44).\n   - Implement a predicate `final_song_count/1` to calculate and represent the total number of songs Bianca has on her mp3 player after the changes.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform addition and subtraction within the `final_song_count/1` predicate.\n   - Subtract the deleted songs from the initial count and then add the new songs to that intermediate result.\n\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Query the `final_song_count` predicate to obtain the total number of songs Bianca has on her mp3 player after making these changes.\n\nBy structuring the code with these predicates and arithmetic operations, we can effectively model the problem in SWI-Prolog and determine the final song count on Bianca's mp3 player.",

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Initial state**: The florist starts with 5 roses.\n2. **Transaction 1 (selling roses)**: The florist sells 3 roses, which decreases the total number of roses.\n3. **Transaction 2 (picking more roses)**: The florist then picks 34 more roses, increasing the total count.\n4. **Final state**: To find out how many roses the florist has in the end, we add the roses sold to the initial count and then add the additional roses picked.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define predicates for initial and final states**:\n   - The initial state predicate will represent the florist having 5 roses initially.\n   - The final state predicate will calculate and represent the total number of roses the florist has after selling and picking roses.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for selling roses**:\n   - This predicate will take the initial count of roses and the number of roses sold as parameters.\n   - It will calculate and return the number of remaining roses after the sale.\n\n3. **Define a predicate for picking more roses**:\n   - This predicate will take the number of remaining roses after the sale and the number of additional roses picked as parameters.\n   - It will calculate and return the new total count of roses.\n\n4. **Implement the predicates with actual values**:\n   - Use 5 as the initial number of roses.\n   - For selling roses, use 3 as the number sold.\n   - For picking more roses, use 34 as the additional count.\n\n5. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities** to perform addition and subtraction to compute the number of remaining roses after each transaction.\n\n6. **Query the final state predicate** to obtain the answer, which is the total number of roses the florist has at the end.\n\nBy structuring the code this way, we can model the problem's logic and use Prolog's inference rules to compute the final count of roses. Here's an outline of the Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Initial state\ninitial_state(5).\n\n% Predicate for selling roses\nsell_roses(InitialCount, RosesSold, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is InitialCount - RosesSold.\n\n% Predicate for picking more roses\npick_roses(Remaining, Additional, Total) :-\n    Total is Remaining + Additional.\n\n% Final state\nfinal_state(Total) :-\n    initial_state(Initial),\n    sell_roses(Initial, 3, Remaining),\n    pick_roses(Remaining, 34, Total).\n```\n\nThis code defines the initial state, predicates for selling and picking roses, and then queries the final state to compute the total number of roses the florist has.",

        "question": "There were 7 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 7 lives, how many lives did they have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about a group of friends playing a video game online. Initially, there were seven friends, and then two more players joined the game. Each player is said to have the same number of lives in the game. The task is to use SWI-Prolog to find the total number of lives this group of players has collectively.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of lives this group of players has, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the variables:\n   - The number of lives each player has is given as 7.\n   - The initial number of players is 7, and then 2 more players join, resulting in a total of 9 players.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of lives:\n   - To find the collective lives, we multiply the number of lives per player by the total number of players.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate to calculate the total number of lives:\n   - Parameters: Number of players, Lives per player.\n   - Returns: Total number of lives.\n\n2. Implement the predicate with the given values:\n   - Use 7 as the initial number of players and 2 as the number of additional players to represent the total number of players (9 players in total).\n   - Use 7 as the lives per player.\n\n3. Compute the result using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n   - Multiply the number of players by the lives per player to get the total lives.\n\n4. Query the predicate with the given values to obtain the solution:\n   - Use the query to find the total number of lives for the given input.\n\nBy following this plan, we can construct a SWI-Prolog code that calculates the total number of lives this group of players has in the video game. This showcases the use of Prolog for solving basic arithmetic problems and handling simple logical relationships.",

The task is to calculate the total number of birds in the pet store by considering the number of bird cages and the number of birds in each cage.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of birds in the pet store, the following information is given:\n- The pet store has a fixed number of bird cages (6 cages).\n- Each bird cage contains a specific number of parrots (6 parrots per cage) and parakeets (2 parakeets per cage).\n\nTo determine the total number of birds, we need to calculate the sum of birds in all the cages. This involves multiplying the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage for both parrots and parakeets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define predicates for bird types and cage contents**:\n   - Create a predicate \"bird_type/1\" to represent different types of birds, e.g., parrot and parakeet.\n   - Create a predicate \"cage_contents/2\" to specify the number of parrots and parakeets in each cage.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of birds**:\n   - Define a predicate \"total_birds/3\" that takes the number of cages, the number of parrots per cage, and the number of parakeets per cage as arguments.\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the total number of parrots and parakeets by multiplying the number of birds per cage with the number of cages.\n   - Sum the totals for parrots and parakeets to find the overall bird count.\n\n3. **Query the total bird count**:\n   - Use the \"total_birds/3\" predicate with the given values (6 cages, 6 parrots per cage, and 2 parakeets per cage) to query the total number of birds in the pet store.\n\nBy organizing the code in this manner, we can effectively compute the total bird count in the pet store while maintaining a clear and logical structure.

Each ticket costs $4, and she buys 3 tickets for herself and her friends, and an additional 5 extra tickets. The task is to calculate the total amount of money Haley spends on these tickets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much Haley spent, we need to:\n\n1. Determine the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Calculate the cost of each ticket.\n3. Multiply the total number of tickets by the cost per ticket to find the total amount spent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define a predicate to calculate the total amount spent**:\n   - Parameters: Number of tickets bought, Cost per ticket.\n   - Returns: Total amount spent.\n\n2. **Provide the specific values for the parameters**:\n   - Number of tickets bought: 3 for herself and her friends, plus 5 extra tickets, totaling 8 tickets.\n   - Cost per ticket: $4.\n\n3. **Implement the predicate to compute the total amount spent**:\n   - Multiply the number of tickets by the cost per ticket.\n\n4. **Query the predicate with the given values to find the solution**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculation.\n\nBy following this plan, we can create a straightforward SWI-Prolog code that computes the total amount Haley spent on concert tickets.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMegan went on an online shopping spree and bought music albums of two different genres: country and pop. She purchased a total of 2 country albums and 8 pop albums. Each album comes with a handy lyric sheet, which is great for singing along, and contains 7 songs. Now, we need to calculate the total number of songs Megan acquired across all these albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of songs, we need to consider the number of albums Megan bought of each genre and the number of songs per album. Here's how we can break it down:\n1. Calculate the total number of songs from country albums by multiplying the number of country albums by the number of songs per album.\n2. Calculate the total number of songs from pop albums by multiplying the number of pop albums by the number of songs per album.\n3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2 to find the grand total of songs Megan bought.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a plan that involves defining predicates to calculate the total number of songs for each genre and then summing them up to find the final count. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Define a predicate `country_songs(NumAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalSongsCountry)` that relates the number of country albums to the total number of songs they contain.\n2.

Each ride cost him the same number of tickets, and now we want to find out the total number of tickets he used for all these rides.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of tickets Oliver used, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Number of Rides**: Oliver rode the Ferris wheel 5 times and the bumper cars 4 times. So, in total, he took 5 + 4 = 9 rides.\n2. **Cost per Ride**: Each ride cost Oliver 7 tickets.\n3. **Total Tickets Used**: To find out how many tickets Oliver used in total, we multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride. This can be calculated as 9 rides * 7 tickets per ride = 63 tickets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the number of rides Oliver took and the cost per ride. Then, we can calculate the total number of tickets he used. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - `ferris_wheel_rides(RW)` to represent the number of times Oliver rode the Ferris wheel.\n   - `bumper_car_rides(RC)` to represent the number of times Oliver rode the bumper cars.\n   - `cost_per_ride(C)` to represent the cost of each ride in tickets.\n   - `total_tickets_used(TT)` to calculate the total number of tickets Oliver used.\n\n2. **Logic and Calculations**:\n   - Use facts to define the number of rides for the Ferris wheel and bumper cars: `ferris_wheel_rides(5).` and `bumper_car_rides(4).`\n   - Define the cost per ride: `cost_per_ride(7).`\n   - Calculate the total tickets used by summing up the rides and multiplying by the cost per ride: `total_tickets_used(TT) :- ferris_wheel_rides(FW), bumper_car_rides(BC), FW + BC = Rides, cost_per_ride(C), TT is Rides * C.`\n\n3. **Query**:\n   - To find out how many tickets Oliver used, query the `total_tickets_used/1` predicate: `query_tickets(TT) :- total_tickets_used(TT).`\n\nBy executing the query, SWI-Prolog will compute the total number of tickets Oliver used, demonstrating the power of logical reasoning in solving practical problems.",

She sold four bead necklaces and three gemstone necklaces, and each necklace had a set price of $3. The goal is to calculate the total amount of money Katie earned from these sales.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Katie earned, we need to follow these steps:\n1. **Identify the variables**:\n   - Let 'B' represent the number of bead necklaces sold.\n   - Let 'G' represent the number of gemstone necklaces sold.\n   - Let 'P' represent the price per necklace.\n   - Let 'T' represent the total amount of money earned.\n2. **Define the values**:\n   - We are given that B = 4, G = 3, and P = 3 dollars.\n3. **Calculate the total amount**:\n   - To find the total amount earned, we multiply the number of items sold by the price per item:\n     - Total amount earned from bead necklaces = B * P\n     - Total amount earned from gemstone necklaces = G * P\n     - Overall total amount earned = (B + G) * P\n4. **Compute the result**:\n   - Plug in the given values:\n     - Total amount earned = (4 + 3) * 3\n5. **Find the final answer**:\n   - Calculate the multiplication:\n     - Total amount earned = 7 * 3 = $21\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the problem and use them to calculate the total amount earned.

        "question": "While shopping for music online, Isabel bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 9 songs. How many songs did Isabel buy total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIsabel purchased a total of 6 country albums and 2 pop albums while shopping for music online. Each album included a lyric sheet, which is not relevant to the question, and had 9 songs. The task is to calculate the total number of songs Isabel acquired through her purchases.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of songs Isabel bought, we need to multiply the number of albums she purchased by the number of songs in each album. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Isabel bought 6 country albums, and each country album contains 9 songs. So, from country albums, she acquired 6 * 9 = 54 songs.\n- She also bought 2 pop albums, and each pop album has 9 songs as well. This results in 2 * 9 = 18 songs from pop albums.\n- To find the overall total, we sum up the songs from country and pop albums: 54 + 18 = 72 songs.\n\nTherefore, Isabel bought a total of 72 songs.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the relationships between the number of albums, songs per album, and the total number of songs purchased. Here's an outline for the plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `country_albums(NumAlbums)` to represent the number of country albums Isabel bought.\n   - `pop_albums(NumAlbums)` to represent the number of pop albums Isabel bought.\n   - `songs_per_album(NumSongs)` to indicate the number of songs in each album.\n   - `total_songs(TotalSongs)` to compute the overall total number of songs Isabel bought.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts to define the number of country and pop albums Isabel purchased.\n   - Define a rule for `songs_per_album/1` to indicate the number of songs in each album.\n   - Create a rule for `total_songs/1` that calculates the sum of songs from country and pop albums. Multiply the number of albums by the songs per album to find the total.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `total_songs/1` predicate to obtain the total number of songs Isabel bought.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, Robin is purchasing flowers from April's discount flower shop, where each flower costs a uniform price of $3. We are given that Robin bought two types of flowers, roses, and daisies, and our task is to calculate the total amount of money she spent on her purchase.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total amount Robin spent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of one flower, which is given as $3.\n2. Calculate the total cost of roses by multiplying the cost per flower by the number of roses purchased. Since Robin bought 5 roses, the cost for roses is 5 * $3.\n3. Similarly, compute the total cost of daisies by multiplying the cost per flower by the number of daisies. Robin bought 4 daisies, so the cost for daisies is 4 * $3.\n4. To find the overall amount Robin spent, sum up the costs for roses and daises. This will give us the total expenditure.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that calculate the cost of each type of flower and then sum them up to find the total amount spent. Here's an outline for the plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `flower_cost/1` to hold the cost of one flower.\n   - `rose_cost/2` to calculate the total cost of roses based on the number of roses and the flower cost.\n   - `daisy_cost/2` to calculate the total cost of daisies based on the number of daisies and the flower cost.\n   - `total_cost/2` to compute the overall cost by summing the costs of roses and daisies.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Utilize arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations, such as multiplication and summation.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the number of roses and daisies Robin purchased to find the total amount she spent.

Each player in the game has an equal number of lives, specifically three lives each.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. There are a total of four players in the game, including the two friends and the additional two players who joined.\n2. Each player possesses an equal number of lives, which is given as three lives per player.\n3.

This predicate will take two arguments: the number of players (`NumPlayers`) and the lives per player (`LivesPerPlayer`).\n2. **Calculate Total Lives**:\n   - Within the `total_lives/2` predicate, use arithmetic operations to multiply the number of players by the lives per player. You can use the `is` operator to perform the calculation.\n3. **Example Query**:\n   - Define an example query to find the total lives when there are 4 players and each player has 3 lives.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of lives\ntotal_lives(NumPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives) :-\n    TotalLives is NumPlayers * LivesPerPlayer.\n\n% Example query\nexample_query(TotalLives) :-\n    NumPlayers = 4,\n    LivesPerPlayer = 3,\n    total_lives(NumPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives).\n```\n\nIn this code, the `total_lives/3` predicate calculates the total lives by multiplying the number of players by the lives per player.

Implement logic:\n   - Use facts to define the given information: `chocolate_boxes(2), caramel_boxes(5), pieces_per_box(4)`.\n   - Define rules to calculate the total number of candies:\n     ```prolog\n     total_candies(Total) :-\n         chocolate_boxes(NumChocoBoxes),\n         caramel_boxes(NumCaramelBoxes),\n         pieces_per_box(NumPieces),\n         Total is (NumChocoBoxes * NumPieces) + (NumCaramelBoxes * NumPieces).\n     ```\n\n3. Test the implementation:\n   - Query the `total_candies(Total)` predicate to obtain the total number of candies Adam has.\n\nBy structuring the code with these predicates and rules, we can accurately calculate the total number of candies Adam has based on the given information. The logic involves multiplying the number of boxes by the number of pieces per box for each type of candy and then summing those results to find the total.",

        "question": "A pet store has 8 bird cages. If each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about the number of bird cages in a pet store and the quantity of parrots and parakeets in each cage. Specifically, the pet store has 8 bird cages, and within each cage, there are 2 parrots and 7 parakeets. The task is to determine the total number of birds in the pet store by adding up the counts of parrots and parakeets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to consider the number of birds in each category (parrots and parakeets) and then sum them up. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Parrots**: Since each cage contains 2 parrots, and there are 8 cages, the total number of parrots can be calculated by multiplying the number of parrots per cage by the number of cages: \n   - Total Parrots = Number of Parrots per Cage * Number of Cages \n   - Total Parrots = 2 * 8 = 16 parrots\n\n2. **Total Parakeets**: Similarly, to find the total count of parakeets, we multiply the number of parakeets in each cage by the total number of cages: \n   - Total Parakeets = Number of Parakeets per Cage * Number of Cages \n   - Total Parakeets = 7 * 8 = 56 parakeets\n\n3. **Total Birds**: To get the overall count of birds in the pet store, we sum up the total parrots and total parakeets: \n   - Total Birds = Total Parrots + Total Parakeets \n   - Total Birds = 16 + 56 = 72 birds\n\nTherefore, by multiplying the counts per cage by the number of cages and then summing the results, we can determine the total number of birds in the pet store.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that calculate the total number of parrots, total number of parakeets, and the overall total number of birds based on the given parameters. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_parrots(NumberOfCages, TotalParrots)` to calculate the total number of parrots based on the number of cages.\n   - `total_parakeets(NumberOfCages, TotalParakeets)` to calculate the total number of parakeets based on the number of cages.\n   - `total_birds(TotalBirds)` to compute the overall total number of birds by summing the total parrots and total parakeets.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Utilize arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform the necessary calculations.\n   - For `total_parrots/2`, multiply the number of parrots per cage by the number of cages.\n   - Similarly, for `total_parakeets/2`, multiply the number of parakeets per cage by the number of cages.\n   - In `total_birds/1`, use the `total_parrots/2` and `total_parakeets/2` predicates to calculate the respective totals and then sum them up.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `total_birds/1` predicate with the given number of cages (8) to obtain the total number of birds.\n   - Verify that the output matches the expected total of 72 birds.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with these predicates and logical relationships, we can effectively compute the total number of birds in the pet store and validate the solution through testing with the provided values.",

        "question": "Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 7 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRoger has organized his spare change into piles, with each pile containing the same number of coins. Specifically, he has three piles of quarters and three piles of dimes, and every pile has seven coins. The task is to calculate the total number of coins Roger has across all these piles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of coins, we need to consider the different types of coins and the number of piles for each type. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Roger has three piles of quarters, and each pile contains seven quarters, so for quarters: `3 piles * 7 quarters per pile = 21 quarters`.\n2. Similarly, for dimes, he has three piles, each with seven dimes, so for dimes: `3 piles * 7 dimes per pile = 21 dimes`.\n3. To find the total number of coins, we sum up the quarters and dimes: `Total coins = Quarters + Dimes = 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of coins based on the given information. Our plan is as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_coins(QuartersPiles, DimesPiles, CoinsPerPile, TotalCoins)` where:\n   - `QuartersPiles` is the number of piles of quarters (3 in this case).\n   - `DimesPiles` is the number of piles of dimes (also 3).\n   - `CoinsPerPile` is the number of coins in each pile (7 coins).\n   - `TotalCoins` is the computed total number of coins.\n2. Calculate the total number of quarters by multiplying `QuartersPiles` by `CoinsPerPile`.\n3. Calculate the total number of dimes similarly.\n4. Sum up the total quarters and total dimes to get `TotalCoins`.\n\nHere's the SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of coins\ntotal_coins(QuartersPiles, DimesPiles, CoinsPerPile, TotalCoins) :-\n    total_quarters(QuartersPiles, CoinsPerPile, TotalQuarters),\n    total_dimes(DimesPiles, CoinsPerPile, TotalDimes),\n    TotalCoins is TotalQuarters + TotalDimes.\n\n% Predicate to calculate total quarters\ntotal_quarters(Piles, CoinsPerPile, TotalQuarters) :-\n    TotalQuarters is Piles * CoinsPerPile.\n\n% Predicate to calculate total dimes\ntotal_dimes(Piles, CoinsPerPile, TotalDimes) :-\n    TotalDimes is Piles * CoinsPerPile.\n\n% Query to find the total number of coins\nquery_total_coins(TotalCoins) :-\n    total_coins(3, 3, 7, TotalCoins).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the total number of coins Roger has.

        "question": "There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given that two friends were initially playing a video game online, and then two more players joined them. Each player is said to have the same number of lives, specifically 8 lives each. The goal is to determine the total number of lives these four players have collectively.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of lives, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Initially, there were two players, and each had 8 lives, so the total lives at this point were 2 * 8 = 16.\n2. When two more players joined, the number of players doubled, resulting in a total of 4 players.\n3. Since each player has the same number of lives, and there are now four players, we can calculate the new total by multiplying the number of players by the lives per player: 4 * 8 = 32.\n4. Therefore, the final total of lives after the two new players joined is 32.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the number of players and lives per player. Here's the structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_lives(NumPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives)` that computes the total number of lives based on the input parameters.\n2. Set the initial values: `NumPlayers` = 2, `LivesPerPlayer` = 8.\n3. Calculate the initial total lives by multiplying the number of players by lives per player: `TotalLives` = `NumPlayers` * `LivesPerPlayer`.\n4. Update the number of players when the new players join: `NumPlayers` = 4.\n5. Recalculate the total lives with the updated number of players: `TotalLives` = `NumPlayers` * `LivesPerPlayer`.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total lives\ntotal_lives(NumPlayers, LivesPerPlayer, TotalLives) :-\n    InitialTotalLives is NumPlayers * LivesPerPlayer,\n    UpdatedNumPlayers is 4,\n    TotalLives is UpdatedNumPlayers * LivesPerPlayer.\n\n% Query to find the total lives when there are 2 players with 8 lives each initially\nquery_total_lives(TotalLives) :-\n    total_lives(2, 8, TotalLives).\n```\n\nThis code defines the calculations and logical flow to determine the total number of lives in the video game scenario. By querying `query_total_lives(TotalLives)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the final total of 32 lives for the four players.",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Zoe bought 3 country albums, and each country album contains an unknown number of songs (let's call this number \"X\").\n2. Similarly, she bought 5 pop albums, and each pop album contains the same number of songs as the country albums, i.e., \"X\" songs per album.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFrank collected recycling cans over two days, Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, he filled 5 bags, and on Sunday, he filled 3 more bags. Each bag contained a constant number of cans, specifically 5 cans per bag. The goal is to calculate the total number of cans Frank picked up across these two days.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of cans collected by Frank, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of bags filled on each day: 5 bags on Saturday and 3 bags on Sunday, for a total of 5 + 3 = 8 bags.\n2. As each bag holds 5 cans, we can find the total number of cans by multiplying the total number of bags by the number of cans in each bag: Total cans = Number of bags * Cans per bag = 8 * 5 = 40 cans.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo create a SWI-Prolog code for this problem, we will define a rule that calculates the total number of cans collected based on the given information. Our plan is as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_cans_collected(SaturdayBags, SundayBags, CansPerBag, TotalCans)` that relates the number of bags filled on Saturday and Sunday, the number of cans in each bag, and the total number of cans collected.\n2. Calculate the total number of bags by summing the bags filled on Saturday and Sunday.\n3.

Each album has a consistent number of songs, and she wants to know the total number of songs she acquired. To find the total number of songs, we need to multiply the number of albums by the number of songs in each album and then sum up the songs from both genres.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of songs in one album (which is a given value).\n2. Find the total number of songs from the country albums by multiplying the number of country albums by the songs per album.\n3. Do the same for the pop albums to find the total number of songs from that genre.\n4. Sum the totals from country and pop albums to get the overall total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to compute the total number of songs by defining rules for each step of the calculation:\n\n1. Create a rule `songs_per_album(SongsPerAlbum)` to represent the given number of songs in each album.\n2. Define a rule `total_country_songs(NumCountryAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalCountrySongs)` to calculate the total number of songs from country albums. This rule multiplies the number of country albums by the songs per album.\n3. Similarly, create a rule `total_pop_songs(NumPopAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalPopSongs)` to calculate the total number of songs from pop albums.\n4. Finally, define a rule `total_songs(TotalCountrySongs, TotalPopSongs, TotalSongs)` to compute the overall total by summing the songs from both genres.\n\nHere's the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of songs per album\nsongs_per_album(8).\n\n% Calculate total country songs\ntotal_country_songs(NumCountryAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalCountrySongs) :-\n    TotalCountrySongs is NumCountryAlbums * SongsPerAlbum.\n\n% Calculate total pop songs\ntotal_pop_songs(NumPopAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalPopSongs) :-\n    TotalPopSongs is NumPopAlbums * SongsPerAlbum.\n\n% Calculate the overall total songs\ntotal_songs(TotalCountrySongs, TotalPopSongs, TotalSongs) :-\n    TotalSongs is TotalCountrySongs + TotalPopSongs.\n\n% Sample query to find the total number of songs\n% ?- total_country_songs(3, SongsPerAlbum, CountryTotal), total_pop_songs(5, SongsPerAlbum, PopTotal), total_songs(CountryTotal, PopTotal, OverallTotal).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code automates the calculation of the total number of songs Nancy acquired during her shopping.

Frank buys 3 decks, and his friend buys 2 decks. To find out their total expenditure, we need to calculate the cost for each person and then sum them up.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be analyzed as follows:\n1. Calculate the cost for Frank's purchase: Number of decks he bought multiplied by the cost per deck.\n2. Calculate the cost for his friend's purchase: Number of decks the friend bought multiplied by the cost per deck.\n3. Add the costs calculated in steps 1 and 2 to find the total expenditure for both Frank and his friend.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total expenditure based on the number of decks bought by Frank and his friend. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_expenditure` that takes four parameters: the number of decks bought by Frank (`FranksDecks`), the number of decks bought by his friend (`FriendsDecks`), the cost per deck (`CostPerDeck`), and the total amount spent (`TotalSpent`).\n2. Calculate Frank's expenditure by multiplying `FranksDecks` by `CostPerDeck`.\n3. Calculate the friend's expenditure by multiplying `FriendsDecks` by `CostPerDeck`.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn a trivia game, George's performance is assessed, with a focus on the number of correct answers he provided during the game. The game is divided into two halves, and each correct answer earns him a specific number of points. To determine George's final score, we need to calculate the total points he earned across both halves of the game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find George's final score, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total points earned in the first half by multiplying the number of correct answers by the points per question.\n2. Repeat the same calculation for the second half to find the total points earned there.\n3. Add the points earned in both halves to obtain George's final score.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem can be structured as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule named `score_per_half(NumCorrectAnswers, PointsPerQuestion, HalfScore)` that calculates the score for a single half of the game. This rule multiplies the number of correct answers by the points earned per question.\n\n2. Define another rule named `final_score(FirstHalfScore, SecondHalfScore, TotalScore)` that computes the total score by adding the scores from both halves of the game.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values from the problem: the number of correct answers in each half and the points earned per question.\n\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute the `TotalScore` by executing the defined rules.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code would look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the score for one half\nscore_per_half(NumCorrectAnswers, PointsPerQuestion, HalfScore) :-\n    HalfScore is NumCorrectAnswers * PointsPerQuestion.\n\n% Define the rule to calculate the final score\nfinal_score(FirstHalfScore, SecondHalfScore, TotalScore) :-\n    TotalScore is FirstHalfScore + SecondHalfScore.\n\n% Sample query to find George's final score\n% ?- score_per_half(6, 3, FirstHalfScore), score_per_half(4, 3, SecondHalfScore), final_score(FirstHalfScore, SecondHalfScore, TotalScore).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code efficiently calculates George's final score in the trivia game by breaking down the problem into logical rules and utilizing SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.",

        "question": "The schools debate team had 26 boys and 46 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given the total number of boys and girls on the school's debate team, and we want to find out how many groups of 9 they can form. To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of students and then determine how many groups of 9 can be formed from that total.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls: 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students.\n2. To find out how many groups of 9 can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by the size of each group (9). This calculation will give us the number of complete groups that can be made.\n3. There might be a remainder when dividing, indicating that there are not enough students to form another complete group. We can consider this remainder to provide additional context in the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the total number of students, divide them into groups, and handle the remainder. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_students(Boys, Girls, Total)` that calculates the total number of students by summing the number of boys and girls.\n2. Define a predicate `groups_formed(Total, GroupSize, NumGroups, Remainder)` that calculates the number of complete groups formed and the remaining students. Use integer division (`//`) to find the number of groups and the modulo operator (`mod`) to find the remainder.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find the number of groups and the remainder when dividing the total number of students by the group size.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total number of students\ntotal_students(Boys, Girls, Total) :-\n    Total is Boys + Girls.\n\n% Calculate the number of groups and the remainder\ngroups_formed(Total, GroupSize, NumGroups, Remainder) :-\n    NumGroups is Total // GroupSize,\n    Remainder is Total mod GroupSize.\n\n% Query to find the number of groups and the remainder\n% ?- total_students(26, 46, Total), groups_formed(Total, 9, NumGroups, Remainder).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem.

To find the answer, we need to calculate the total number of shelves required to accommodate all the soda cans.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by dividing the total number of soda cans by the capacity of each shelf.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, a group of four friends visited a restaurant, and the chef had already prepared nine chicken wings. To accommodate the group, the chef cooked seven more chicken wings. The task is to determine how many chicken wings each person in the group will receive if they are distributed equally.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many chicken wings each person will get, we need to calculate the total number of chicken wings available and then divide that by the number of friends in the group. This problem involves basic arithmetic operations: addition to find the total number of chicken wings and division to allocate them equally among the friends.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"wings_per_person(TotalWings, NumFriends, WingsEach)\" that relates the total number of chicken wings available, the number of friends, and the number of wings each person receives.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the total number of wings by adding the initially available wings and the newly cooked wings.\n3.

The sample query computes WingsEach by summing the initially available wings and the newly cooked wings and providing the number of friends.",

        "question": "Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, Gwen and her friends are recycling paper, and they earn points based on the weight of the recycled paper. Specifically, they earn one point for every three pounds of recycled paper. Given the weights of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends, the task is to calculate the total number of points they earned.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of points earned, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of recycled paper by summing up the contributions from Gwen and her friends.\n2. Determine how many sets of three pounds there are in the total weight to find the number of points earned.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, a logical approach can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `earn_points(PoundsRecycled, PointsEarned)` that relates the weight of recycled paper to the points earned. This rule will calculate the points earned based on the given weight.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations. For every three pounds, one point is earned, so you can divide the total weight by three to find the number of points.\n3. Instantiate the rule with the given values of recycled paper weight for Gwen and her friends to find the total points earned.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate points earned for recycled pounds\nearn_points(PoundsRecycled, PointsEarned) :-\n    PointsPerPounds is 3,  % One point is earned for every 3 pounds\n    PointsEarned is floor(PoundsRecycled / PointsPerPounds).\n\n% Sample query to find the total points earned\n% ?- earn_points(5, GwenPoints), earn_points(13, FriendsPoints), TotalPoints is GwenPoints + FriendsPoints.\n```\n\nIn this code, the `earn_points` rule calculates the points earned for a given weight of recycled paper. The `floor` function is used to ensure that only whole points are considered. The sample query calculates the points earned by Gwen and her friends separately and then sums them up to find the total points earned.",

She plans on eating 8 pieces of candy per day, and we need to determine how long this candy will last, i.e., the number of days she can eat candy without running out.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how long the candy will last, we can divide the total number of candies by the number of candies Megan eats per day:\n\n- Total number of candies = Candies from neighbors + Candies from sister\n- Days the candy will last = Total number of candies / Candies eaten per day\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1.

She wants to distribute these pictures equally among 5 different albums.

        "question": "A vase can hold 5 flowers. If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we have a fixed number of flowers of two different types (carnations and roses), and we want to determine the minimum number of vases needed to hold these flowers, given that each vase can hold up to 5 flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider how to efficiently distribute the flowers among the vases. One approach is to keep placing flowers in vases until all flowers are accounted for. Since each vase has a capacity of 5 flowers, we can use division and modulo operations to determine the number of vases required.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers: 6 carnations and 19 roses, resulting in 25 flowers altogether.\n2. Use integer division to find out how many groups of 5 flowers (vases) we can make from the total number of flowers.\n3. If there are any remaining flowers that don't form a complete group of 5, we'll need an additional vase to hold them.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem can be structured as follows:\n\n1. **Define a predicate to calculate the total number of flowers**:\n   - Parameters: Number of carnations, Number of roses.\n   - Returns: Total flower count.\n\n2. **Define a predicate to calculate the number of vases required**:\n   - Parameters: Total number of flowers.\n   - Returns: Number of vases needed.\n\n3. **Implement the logic**:\n   - Use integer division to find the number of complete groups of 5 flowers.\n   - Use the modulo operator to check if there are any remaining flowers that don't form a complete group. If there are, increment the vase count.\n\n4. **Query the predicates with the given data**:\n   - Use 6 for the number of carnations and 19 for the number of roses to compute the total number of flowers.\n   - Use the total flower count to determine the minimum number of vases needed.\n\nBy following this plan, we can create SWI-Prolog code that efficiently calculates the number of vases required to hold the given number of carnations and roses, ensuring that each vase adheres to the capacity constraint of holding up to 5 flowers.",

To find out how many groups there would be, we need to calculate the total number of players and then divide that by the desired group size.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves basic arithmetic operations and can be solved by following these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of players by adding the count of new players and returning players.\n2. Divide the total number of players by the desired group size to find out how many groups can be formed.\n3.

To find the answer, we need to determine how many complete sets of 3 cards he can make and whether he has any remaining cards that would require additional pages.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n1.

Calculate the total number of players: Add the number of managers to the number of employees.\n2. Determine the average team size: Divide the total number of players by the number of teams.\n3.

Define a rule `total_players(NumManagers, NumEmployees, TotalPlayers)` that calculates the total number of players by summing the number of managers and employees.\n\n2. Define another rule `average_team_size(TotalPlayers, NumTeams, AvgTeamSize)` that calculates the ideal average team size by dividing the total number of players by the number of teams.\n\n3.

        "question": "There school's baseball team had 2 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group, how many groups would there be?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about the number of new and returning players on a school's baseball team. There are 2 new players and 6 returning players, and the coach wants to organize these players into groups of 4. The task is to determine how many groups there will be. To find the number of groups, we need to calculate the total number of players and then divide that by the number of players in each group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by performing the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of players by adding the number of new players and returning players.\n2. Determine the number of groups by dividing the total number of players by the size of each group.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of groups based on the total number of players and the desired group size. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_groups(TotalPlayers, GroupSize, NumGroups)` that relates the total number of players, the size of each group, and the number of groups formed.\n2. Calculate the total number of players by summing the new and returning players. You can use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform this calculation.\n3. Determine the number of groups by dividing the `TotalPlayers` by the `GroupSize`. Again, SWI-Prolog's arithmetic can be used for division.\n4. Instantiate the `number_of_groups` predicate with the given values for new and returning players, along with the group size, and query for `NumGroups`.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code would look based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of groups\nnumber_of_groups(TotalPlayers, GroupSize, NumGroups) :-\n    NumGroups is integer(TotalPlayers / GroupSize).\n\n% Calculate the total number of players\ntotal_players(NewPlayers, ReturningPlayers, TotalPlayers) :-\n    TotalPlayers is NewPlayers + ReturningPlayers.\n\n% Example query to find the number of groups\n% ?- total_players(2, 6, TotalPlayers), number_of_groups(TotalPlayers, 4, NumGroups).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines rules to calculate the total number of players and then determine the number of groups based on the given conditions. The query at the end will output the number of groups formed with 4 players each from the given set of new and returning players.",

We want to determine how long it will take for all these puppies to be adopted if three puppies are adopted each day.

Additional puppies brought in = 3\n3. Number of puppies adopted per day = 3\n\nWe need to calculate the number of days it will take to adopt all six puppies. This can be done by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code for this problem can be structured as follows:\n\n1.

To find out how many candies he can buy, we need to calculate his total ticket winnings and then determine if he has enough tickets to purchase the candies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Luke has won by summing up his winnings from both games.\n2. Determine the cost of one candy, which is given as 3 tickets.\n3. Find out how many candies Luke can buy by dividing his total tickets by the cost per candy and rounding down to the nearest whole number (as he can only buy whole candies).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to compute the number of candies Luke can afford with his tickets. Here's a structured plan for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_tickets(WhackAMoleTickets, SkeeBallTickets, TotalTickets)` that calculates the sum of tickets won from both games.

Calculate the total number of trays Luke needs to pick up: 20 trays from one table + 16 trays from another = 36 trays.\n2. Determine the number of trays he can carry per trip: 4 trays.\n3. Divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry to find the number of trips: 36 trays / 4 trays per trip.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of trips required based on the total number of trays and the number of trays Luke can carry per trip. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_trays(Table1, Table2, TotalTrays)` that calculates the total number of trays by summing the trays from two tables (`Table1` and `Table2`).\n2.

        "question": "John was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 8 new cards and 16 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJohn is organizing his baseball cards in a binder, placing 3 cards on each page. He has a collection of 8 new baseball cards and 16 old baseball cards that he wants to put into this binder. To find out how many pages he will need, we need to calculate the total number of cards and then determine how many groups of 3 cards (or pages) are needed to accommodate them all.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by performing the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of baseball cards: Add the number of new cards to the number of old cards (8 + 16).\n2. Determine the number of pages needed: Divide the total number of cards by the number of cards that can fit on each page (3 cards per page).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo represent this problem in swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of pages required based on the given input of the number of new and old baseball cards. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_cards(NewCards, OldCards, TotalCards)` that calculates the total number of baseball cards by summing `NewCards` and `OldCards`.\n2. Define another rule named `pages_needed(TotalCards, CardsPerPage, Pages)` that calculates the number of pages required. It takes the `TotalCards` and `CardsPerPage` as input and computes `Pages` as the integer division of `TotalCards` by `CardsPerPage`.\n3. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and unify the results with the respective variables.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of baseball cards\ntotal_cards(NewCards, OldCards, TotalCards) :-\n    TotalCards is NewCards + OldCards.\n\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of pages needed\npages_needed(TotalCards, CardsPerPage, Pages) :-\n    Pages is ceiling(TotalCards / CardsPerPage).\n\n% Example query to calculate the number of pages needed\n% ?- total_cards(8, 16, TotalCards), pages_needed(TotalCards, 3, Pages).\n% This should output the number of pages required for the given number of cards.\n```\n\nIn this plan, we use the `ceiling` function to ensure that we get the smallest integer greater than or equal to the calculated value, as John would need to use a new page even if there is space for fewer than 3 cards on it. This Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of pages required for John's baseball card collection, demonstrating how Prolog can be used for solving practical problems involving arithmetic and logical relationships.",

With a total of 40 students and 14 adults, the task is to determine the minimum number of vans necessary for their journey.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo address this problem, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of people going on the field trip by adding the number of students and adults: 40 students + 14 adults.\n2. Determine the number of vans needed by dividing the total number of people by the capacity of each van (9 people per van). This calculation will give us the minimum number of vans required.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe solution in SWI-Prolog involves defining predicates to represent the problem constraints and then querying the system to find the minimum number of vans needed. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Define a predicate `total_people(Students, Adults, Total)` that relates the number of students and adults to the total number of people: `Total is Students + Adults`.\n2. Define a predicate `vans_needed(Total, Capacity, Vans)` that calculates the number of vans required based on the total number of people and the capacity of each van: `Vans is ceiling(Total / Capacity)`. Here, `ceiling(X / Y)` represents the ceiling division, ensuring that we get a whole number of vans even if there are fractional people per van.\n3. Query the system to find the number of vans needed by providing the number of students, adults, and the van capacity: `?- vans_needed(Total, Capacity, Vans).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code based on this plan would look like:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_people(Students, Adults, Total) :- Total is Students + Adults.\n\nvans_needed(Total, Capacity, Vans) :-\n    Vans is ceiling(Total / Capacity).\n\nfield_trip(Students, Adults, Vans) :-\n    total_people(Students, Adults, Total),\n    vans_needed(Total, 9, Vans).\n\n% Query\n?- field_trip(40, 14, Vans).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships between the number of students, adults, total people, and vans needed. The `ceiling` function ensures that we get a whole number of vans, even if the number of people doesn't divide evenly by the van capacity. The query `field_trip(40, 14, Vans)` will yield the number of vans required for the field trip.",

        "question": "Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFrank has earned a total of $63 from his lawn-mowing and weed-eating jobs. He spends $7 each week, and the task is to determine how many weeks this amount of money will last. To solve this, we need to divide Frank's total earnings by his weekly expenditure.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:\n1. Frank's total earnings: $5 + $58 = $63\n2. Calculate the number of weeks the money will last: $63 divided by $7 per week.\n3. The result will give the number of weeks Frank can sustain his $7 weekly expenditure.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of weeks Frank's money will last based on his total earnings and weekly expenditure. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule, let's call it \"money_duration,\" that takes parameters for total_earnings and weekly_expenditure.\n2. Calculate the duration (in weeks) by dividing total_earnings by weekly_expenditure.\n3. Implement the logic by creating a predicate for the \"money_duration\" rule that performs the division operation.\n4. Test the implementation by querying the \"money_duration\" rule with Frank's total earnings and weekly expenditure to obtain the result in weeks.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\nmoney_duration(TotalEarnings, WeeklyExpenditure, Weeks) :-\n    Weeks is floor(TotalEarnings / WeeklyExpenditure).\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `floor` function is used to round down the result of the division, ensuring that we get a whole number of weeks. This code structure demonstrates how to model a simple financial calculation in SWI-Prolog, providing a solution to the problem of determining the duration of Frank's savings based on his spending habits.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA group of friends were playing an online video game, starting with 11 players. Midway through the game, 5 players decided to quit, leaving only the remaining players active. Each player in the game, including those who remained and those who left, started with the same number of lives, specifically 5 lives. The task is to calculate the total number of lives that the remaining players, those who didn't quit, have collectively across their active game sessions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of lives left for the remaining players, we need to consider two groups of players: those who quit and those who stayed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Players who quit**:\n   - Number of players who quit: 5\n   - Each of these players had 5 lives.\n\n2. **Players who stayed**:\n   - Number of players remaining: 11 total players at the start minus 5 who quit = 6 players\n   - Each of these players also has 5 lives.\n\n3. **Total lives calculation**:\n   - For the players who quit, multiply the number of players by their lives per player: 5 players * 5 lives = 25 lives\n   - For the players who stayed, perform a similar calculation: 6 players * 5 lives = 30 lives\n   - To find the total number of lives left for the active players, sum the lives from both groups: 25 lives + 30 lives = 55 lives\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the number of players who started, the number of players who quit, and the lives per player. Here's an outline:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate `total_lives/3` to calculate the total number of lives based on the inputs.\n   - Include parameters for the starting number of players, the number of players who quit, and the lives per player.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the `total_lives/3` predicate to perform the necessary calculations:\n     - Calculate the lives for the players who quit: `LivesQuit is PlayersQuit * LivesPerPlayer`\n     - Calculate the lives for the players who stayed: `LivesActive is (StartingPlayers - PlayersQuit) * LivesPerPlayer`\n     - Compute the total lives: `TotalLives is LivesQuit + LivesActive`\n\n3. **Test Case**:\n   - Define a test case with the given values to ensure the predicate produces the correct result:\n     - `total_lives(11, 5, 5, TotalLives).`\n\n4. **Expected Output**:\n   - The expected output for the test case is `TotalLives = 55`.\n\nBy structuring the SWI-Prolog code with these predicates and arithmetic operations, we can solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing.",

In this case, she is awarded 5 points per bag. Initially, she possesses 11 bags, but decides not to recycle 2 of them. The objective of the problem is to calculate the total number of points she accumulates, taking into account the bags she chose not to recycle.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of points Wendy earns, we need to consider the following steps:\n1. **Total Bags Recycled**: Start by acknowledging that Wendy has a total of 11 bags.\n2. **Bags Not Recycled**: It is given that she chose not to recycle 2 of these bags.\n3. **Points per Bag**: For each bag she recycles, she earns a fixed amount of 5 points.\n4. **Total Points Earned**: To find the total points she earns, we multiply the number of bags she recycled by the points earned per bag.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of points Wendy earns based on the given information. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate, `total_points/2`, that takes the number of bags recycled and the points earned per bag as input, and returns the total number of points earned.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n     - Multiply the number of bags recycled by the points earned per bag to obtain the total points earned.\n\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Provide the known values from the problem, such as the total bags Wendy had and the number of bags she didn't recycle, to test the `total_points/2` predicate.\n\nHere's a potential implementation of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_points(BagsRecycled, PointsPerBag, TotalPoints) :-\n    TotalPoints is BagsRecycled * PointsPerBag.\n```\n\nIn this code, the `total_points/2` predicate calculates the total points earned by multiplying the number of bags recycled by the points earned per bag. The specific values for the number of bags recycled and points per bag can be provided when querying this predicate to obtain the final result.\n\nBy structuring the code in this manner, we create a concise and efficient solution that aligns with the logical steps outlined in the analysis section.",

        "question": "Each chocolate bar in a box cost $3. If a box had 7 bars total and Olivia sold all but 4 bars, how much money would she have made?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nOlivia is selling chocolate bars from a box that originally contained seven bars, each priced at $3. She has sold some of the bars but wants to determine her earnings, specifically how much money she has made from the sales. To find the total amount of money she has earned, we need to calculate the number of bars sold and then multiply that by the cost per bar.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven:\n- Each chocolate bar costs $3.\n- The box initially had 7 bars.\n- Olivia sold all but 4 bars.\n\nTo Find:\n- The number of bars sold.\n- The total amount of money made from the sales.\n\nSolution:\n1. **Number of Bars Sold**: To find out how many chocolate bars Olivia sold, we subtract the number of bars she has left (4) from the total number of bars in the box originally (7). So, she sold: 7 bars - 4 remaining bars = 3 bars.\n2. **Total Money Made**: To calculate the total amount of money made from the sale of these chocolate bars, we multiply the number of bars sold by the cost per bar. So, the total amount made is: 3 bars * $3/bar = $9.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total amount of money made based on the number of bars sold and the cost per bar:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `cost_per_bar/1` to represent the cost of each chocolate bar.\n   - `initial_total_bars/1` to represent the total number of bars in the box initially.\n   - `remaining_bars/1` to represent the number of bars Olivia has left.\n   - `bars_sold/2` to calculate the number of bars sold based on the initial total and remaining bars.\n   - `total_money_made/2` to compute the total amount of money made by multiplying the bars sold by the cost per bar.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts to define the cost per bar and the initial total bars.\n   - Create rules for `bars_sold/2` and `total_money_made/2` to perform the necessary arithmetic calculations.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `total_money_made` predicate with the given values to ensure it returns the correct amount made from the sale of chocolate bars.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with these predicates and relationships, we can solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing.",

        "question": "Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Kaleb still have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKaleb, in a generous act, purchased 14 boxes of chocolate candy, each containing 6 delicious pieces. However, in a display of brotherly love, he chose to give exactly 5 of those boxes to his little brother. The objective now is to determine how many pieces of chocolate candy remain in Kaleb's possession.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of chocolate pieces remaining with Kaleb, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Initial Total Pieces**: Start by calculating the total number of chocolate pieces Kaleb had initially. This is simply the product of the number of boxes he bought and the number of pieces in each box.\n2. **Given Away**: Next, determine how many pieces Kaleb gave to his little brother. This is equivalent to the number of boxes he gave away, each containing a fixed number of pieces.\n3. **Remaining Pieces**: Finally, to find the answer we seek, subtract the number of pieces Kaleb gave away from the initial total number of pieces he had.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate, `remaining_pieces/2`, that takes two arguments: the initial number of boxes Kaleb bought and the final number of pieces he has left.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Within the `remaining_pieces/2` predicate, perform the following arithmetic operations:\n     - Calculate `total_initial_pieces` by multiplying the number of boxes bought by the number of pieces per box.\n     - Compute `given_away_pieces` by multiplying the number of boxes given away by the pieces per box.\n     - Derive `remaining_pieces` by subtracting `given_away_pieces` from `total_initial_pieces`.\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Instantiate the `remaining_pieces/2` predicate with the values from the problem statement: 14 boxes bought initially and 5 boxes given away.\n\nHere is how the SWI-Prolog code would look:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_pieces(InitialBoxes, RemainingPieces) :-\n    TotalInitialPieces is InitialBoxes * PiecesPerBox,\n    GivenAwayPieces is BoxesGivenAway * PiecesPerBox,\n    RemainingPieces is TotalInitialPieces - GivenAwayPieces.\n```\n\nIn this code, `PiecesPerBox` and `BoxesGivenAway` are constants representing the number of pieces in each box and the number of boxes Kaleb gave to his little brother, respectively. By executing this code, SWI-Prolog will compute the number of chocolate pieces Kaleb has left, providing a clear and concise solution to the problem.",

        "question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA group of 12 people, consisting of 7 children and the remaining adults, visit a restaurant. The restaurant offers a unique pricing structure where kids eat for free, and each adult meal costs $3. To determine the total cost for the group, we need to calculate the number of adults and then multiply that by the cost of an adult meal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven the total number of people (12) and the number of children (7) in the group, we can calculate the number of adults as the difference between the total and the number of children: 12 - 7 = 5 adults. Since kids eat for free, the cost for the group depends solely on the number of adults. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of adults by the cost of an adult meal, which is $3. This calculation will give us the total expenditure for the group.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total cost for the group based on the number of adults and the cost of an adult meal. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule, let's call it \"group_meal_cost/3,\" which takes the total number of people in the group, the number of children, and the cost of an adult meal as inputs.\n2. Calculate the number of adults in the group by subtracting the number of children from the total number of people.\n3. Multiply the number of adults by the cost of an adult meal to find the total cost for the adults.\n4. The total cost for the group is the sum of the cost for the adults and the cost for the children (which is always 0 since kids eat free).\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```prolog\ngroup_meal_cost(TotalPeople, Kids, AdultMealCost, TotalCost) :-\n    NumAdults is TotalPeople - Kids,\n    AdultCost is NumAdults * AdultMealCost,\n    TotalCost is AdultCost.\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we define the rule `group_meal_cost/4` that calculates the total cost for the group. It takes the inputs `TotalPeople` (the size of the group), `Kids` (the number of children), and `AdultMealCost` (the cost of an adult meal), and computes the `TotalCost`. By subtracting the number of children from the total people, we find the number of adults. Then, we calculate the cost for the adults by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal. Finally, the total cost for the group is determined.\n\nTo solve the specific problem mentioned, we can query the SWI-Prolog interpreter with the given values:\n\n```prolog\ngroup_meal_cost(12, 7, 3, TotalCost).\n```\n\nThis query will yield the total cost for the group of 12 people with 7 children when each adult meal costs $3.",

For the remaining players, each had a certain number of lives, and the goal is to determine the total number of lives they collectively possess.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of lives for the remaining players, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Identify the number of remaining players**: Given that 7 players quit out of the initial 16, we can find the number of players who stayed in the game.\n2. **Determine lives per player**: According to the problem, each remaining player has the same number of lives, which is given as 8 lives.\n3. **Calculate the total lives**: To find the collective lives for all the remaining players, we multiply the number of players by the lives per player.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the given inputs: the initial number of players, the number of players who quit, and the lives per player.

He intends to sell the remaining operational games for a set price of $7 per game. The objective is to compute the total monetary amount he can generate from selling these functioning games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the potential earnings from Mike's sale of his operable video games, you can follow these sequential steps:\n1. **Identify the Number of Working Games**: Given a total of 16 games, half of which are non-functional, you can calculate the number of working games: 16 games minus 8 non-working games equals 8 functioning games.\n2. **Calculate Earnings per Game**: Mike plans to sell each working game for $7.\n3. **Compute Total Earnings**: To find out how much money Mike can make, you multiply the number of working games by the sale price per game: 8 working games times $7 per game, resulting in a total sum.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that computes the total amount of money Mike can earn from selling his working video games. Our Prolog code will be structured as follows:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule named \"total_earnings\" that accepts parameters for the total number of video games, the number of non-working games, the selling price per working game, and the final amount of money earned.\n2. **Calculate Working Games**: Within the rule, subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of video games to find out how many are functional.\n3. **Compute Total Earnings**: Multiply the number of working games by the selling price to calculate Mike's potential earnings.\n4. **Test the Rule**: Provide the known values from the problem to test the rule and ensure it yields the correct earnings amount.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would be structured as shown below:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(TotalGames, NonWorkingGames, PricePerGame, TotalEarnings) :-\n    WorkingGames is TotalGames - NonWorkingGames,\n    TotalEarnings is WorkingGames * PricePerGame.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule exemplifies how to approach a practical problem involving basic arithmetic operations and variables. By structuring the code with clear predicates, we can efficiently compute the desired outcome and validate the solution's accuracy through testing.",

        "question": "A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA painter has a task of painting 12 rooms in a building, and he has made good progress by already painting 5 of those rooms. Each room takes a consistent 7 hours to paint. The question is, how much longer will it take for the painter to complete the remaining rooms?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much more time the painter needs, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of rooms left to be painted: \n   - Total rooms - Painted rooms = Rooms left \n\n2. Determine the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms: \n   - Rooms left * Time per room = Total time for remaining rooms \n\n3. Finally, we can find out how much longer the painter needs to work: \n   - Total time for remaining rooms - Time already spent painting \n\n4. This will give us the additional time required for the painter to finish the job.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the remaining time needed based on the given parameters. Here's an outline for the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a rule, `remaining_time/4`, to calculate the remaining time required to paint the rooms. This rule will take the following parameters: the total number of rooms, the number of painted rooms, the time per room, and the variable to hold the remaining time.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Calculate the number of rooms left by subtracting the painted rooms from the total rooms.\n   - Determine the total time needed for the remaining rooms by multiplying the rooms left by the time per room.\n   - Compute the remaining time by subtracting the time already spent painting (which can be calculated as the number of painted rooms times the time per room).\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Implement the `remaining_time/4` rule using Prolog's arithmetic operations: `is/2` for evaluating arithmetic expressions.\n   - Structure the rule to perform the calculations outlined in the analysis section.\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Provide the known values for the total rooms, painted rooms, and time per room to test the `remaining_time/4` rule.\n   - Verify that the output matches the expected remaining time.\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively translate the problem into SWI-Prolog code, utilizing the language's arithmetic capabilities to compute the remaining time required for the painter to complete the job.",

He wants to provide enough cupcakes so that each attendee will have 4 cupcakes. The task is to calculate the total number of cupcakes Mike should purchase to accommodate this.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of cupcakes Mike should buy, you need to consider the number of attendees and the desired number of cupcakes per person:\n\n- **Number of Attendees**: Out of the 13 invited friends, only 6 are able to come. So, the number of attendees is 6.\n\n- **Desired Cupcakes per Person**: Mike wants each person to have exactly 4 cupcakes.\n\nThe calculation is simply multiplying the number of attendees by the desired number of cupcakes per person:\n\n- **Total Cupcakes** = Number of Attendees * Desired Cupcakes per Person\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of cupcakes needed based on the input values:\n\n1. Define a rule, let's call it \"total_cupcakes/3,\" which takes the number of invited friends, the number of attendees, and the desired number of cupcakes per person as arguments.\n\n2. Calculate the number of attendees by subtracting the unavailable friends from the total invited friends.\n\n3.

The number of `Attendees` is derived by subtracting the unavailable friends (`AttendingFriends`) from the total invited friends (`InvitedFriends`).\n\nTo solve for the number of cupcakes needed, you can query the SWI-Prolog interpreter with the provided values:\n\n```prolog\n?- total_cupcakes(13, 6, 4, TotalCupcakes).\n```\n\nThis query will return the value of `TotalCupcakes`, giving you the answer to how many cupcakes Mike should buy.\n\nThe logic here is straightforward, and the SWI-Prolog code reflects the direct translation of the problem into a logical programming format.",

You are presented with a level containing 8 enemies in total, and you manage to destroy all but 6 of them. The objective is to calculate the number of points you will earn based on the number of enemies defeated.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of points earned, you need to find the difference between the total number of enemies in the level and the number of enemies that were left undefeated. This difference will represent the count of enemies you successfully defeated. Subsequently, you can multiply this count by the points earned per enemy to calculate your total score for that level.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Enemies in the Level**: There are 8 enemies to begin with.\n2. **Undefeated Enemies**: You were unable to defeat 6 enemies.\n3. **Enemies Defeated**: To find out how many you defeated, subtract the undefeated count from the total: 8 - 6 = 2 enemies defeated.\n4. **Points per Enemy**: Each defeated enemy grants you 5 points.\n5. **Total Points Earned**: Multiply the number of defeated enemies by the points earned per enemy: 2 enemies * 5 points/enemy = 10 points earned.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total points earned based on the number of enemies defeated and the points earned per enemy.

        "question": "A new building needed 9 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 6 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe builder is in the process of installing windows in a new building, and there is a fixed amount of time required to install each window: specifically, 6 hours per window. The problem involves calculating the time it will take for the builder to install the remaining windows given that information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine how long it will take for the builder to finish installing the remaining windows, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the given values: There are 9 windows needed for the building, and the builder has already installed 6 of them.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining windows: If 6 windows have been installed, then 9 - 6 = 3 windows are yet to be installed.\n3. Compute the total time required to install the remaining windows: Each window takes 6 hours to install, so for the remaining 3 windows, it will take 3 windows * 6 hours/window = 18 hours.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total time needed to install the remaining windows based on the given values. Here's an outline for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule, `total_time_remaining/2`, that takes the number of windows needed for the building and the number of windows already installed as input.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining windows by subtracting the installed windows from the total needed.\n3. Compute the total time required to install the remaining windows by multiplying the number of remaining windows by the time taken to install each window (6 hours).\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_time_remaining(TotalWindows, InstalledWindows, TimeRemaining) :-\n    RemainingWindows is TotalWindows - InstalledWindows,\n    TimePerWindowHours is 6,  % Given that each window takes 6 hours to install\n    TimeRemaining is RemainingWindows * TimePerWindowHours.\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a rule that calculates the time remaining to install the windows. The `is` operator is used for arithmetic evaluation, and variables are capitalized by convention. The code multiplies the remaining windows by the time needed to install each window to get the total time required.\n\nTo test the code, you can query it with the given values:\n\n```prolog\n?- total_time_remaining(9, 6, TimeRemaining).\n```\n\nAnd the system should respond with the calculated time remaining, which is 18 hours in this case.",

The objective is to determine the amount of money Adam spent specifically on riding the Ferris wheel.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the amount spent on the Ferris wheel, we need to calculate the difference in ticket usage before and after the ride. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Money Spent on Tickets**: Given that each ticket costs $9, and Adam bought 13 tickets, we can calculate the total money spent on tickets:\n   - Total money spent = Number of tickets * Cost per ticket\n   - Total money spent = 13 tickets * $9/ticket = $117\n\n2. **Money Spent on Ferris Wheel**: To find out how much Adam spent on the Ferris wheel, we need to calculate the difference between the total money spent on tickets and the value of the tickets he had left after riding the Ferris wheel:\n   - Money spent on Ferris wheel = Total money spent - Value of remaining tickets\n   - Given that he had 4 tickets left, the value of those tickets is: 4 tickets * $9/ticket = $36\n   - Now, subtract this value from the total money spent: $117 - $36 = $81\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the money spent on the Ferris wheel based on the given inputs and constraints.

        "question": "Dave bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. If each box has 3 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Dave still have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDave originally purchased 12 boxes of chocolate candy, each containing an equal number of 3 chocolate pieces. He then gave away a portion of his boxes to his little brother, leaving him with a smaller quantity. The problem requires us to calculate the number of chocolate pieces that Dave possesses after giving away some of the boxes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of chocolate pieces that Dave has remaining, we can perform the following calculations:\n1. **Initial Total Pieces**: Dave started with 12 boxes, and each box contained 3 chocolate pieces, so initially, he had 12 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 36 chocolate pieces.\n2. **Pieces Given to Brother**: Dave gave away 5 boxes to his little brother. This means he gave away 5 boxes * 3 pieces/box = 15 chocolate pieces.\n3. **Remaining Pieces**: To find out how many pieces Dave has left, we subtract the number of pieces he gave to his brother from the initial total: 36 pieces - 15 pieces = 21 pieces.\n\nTherefore, after giving 5 boxes to his little brother, Dave is left with 21 chocolate pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of chocolate pieces Dave has left based on the given information. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate `initial_total_pieces/2` to calculate the initial total number of chocolate pieces based on the number of boxes and pieces per box.\n   - Define another predicate `pieces_given_away/3` to calculate the number of pieces Dave gave to his brother based on the number of boxes given and pieces per box.\n   - Finally, define the main predicate `remaining_pieces/3` to calculate the number of pieces Dave has left after giving away some boxes.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations to perform multiplications and subtractions within the predicates.\n\n3. **Testing**:\n   - Input the values from the problem (initial box count, pieces per box, and boxes given away) to test the implementation.\n\nHere's a potential structure for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_total_pieces(NumberOfBoxes, PiecesPerBox, TotalPieces) :-\n    TotalPieces is NumberOfBoxes * PiecesPerBox.\n\npieces_given_away(BoxesGiven, PiecesPerBox, GivenPieces) :-\n    GivenPieces is BoxesGiven * PiecesPerBox.\n\nremaining_pieces(InitialBoxes, BoxesGiven, RemainingPieces) :-\n    initial_total_pieces(InitialBoxes, 3, TotalPieces),\n    pieces_given_away(BoxesGiven, 3, GivenPieces),\n    RemainingPieces is TotalPieces - GivenPieces.\n```\n\nBy defining these predicates and using arithmetic operations, we can accurately calculate the number of chocolate pieces Dave has left and demonstrate the practical application of SWI-Prolog in solving everyday problems.",

He currently possesses five action figures and is aware that each additional figure costs a uniform price of $5. To finish his collection, he needs to determine the total monetary amount required to purchase the remaining two action figures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total cost for John to complete his action figure collection, we can follow these steps:\n1. Identify the number of action figures John needs to reach his goal: \n   - Total needed = 7 \n   - Current collection = 5 \n   - Remaining needed = 7 - 5 = 2 \n2. Calculate the total cost for the remaining action figures: \n   - Cost per action figure = $5 \n   - Total cost for remaining figures = $5 * 2 = $10 \n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total amount of money John needs to finish his collection based on the given inputs.

The rule then computes the remaining number of figures needed and multiplies it by the cost per figure to derive the `TotalCost`.\n\nBy using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and defining a clear rule, we can efficiently solve this problem and determine the monetary amount required for John to achieve his collection goal.",

The problem is to determine how much longer the painter needs to finish painting the remaining rooms.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much longer the painter needs, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of rooms left to be painted: Given that the painter has already painted 5 rooms, the number of rooms left is 9 total rooms - 5 painted rooms = 4 rooms.\n2. Determine the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms: If it takes 8 hours to paint one room, then to paint 4 rooms, it will take 4 rooms * 8 hours per room = 32 hours.\n3. Find out how much longer the painter needs to work: Since we know the total time required to paint the remaining rooms, we can subtract the time already spent painting the completed rooms. The time already spent is 5 rooms * 8 hours per room = 40 hours. So, the additional time needed is 32 hours - 40 hours = -8 hours.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the additional time needed by the painter to finish the remaining rooms.

Define the predicate `already_painted(PaintedRooms, PaintedTime)`:\n   ```prolog\n   already_painted(PaintedRooms, PaintedTime) :- total_time_per_room(PaintedRooms, PaintedTime).\n   ```\n\n4. Define the predicate `remaining_time(TotalTime, PaintedTime, RemainingHours)`:\n   ```prolog\n   remaining_time(TotalTime, PaintedTime, RemainingHours) :- RemainingHours is TotalTime - PaintedTime.\n   ```\n\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nAdam originally had 13 boxes of chocolate candy, each containing 6 pieces. He gave 7 boxes to his little brother. To find out how many pieces Adam has left, we need to subtract the number of pieces given to his brother from the total number of pieces he had initially.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can calculate the number of pieces Adam has left by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces in all 13 boxes: 13 boxes * 6 pieces/box.\n2. Calculate the number of pieces Adam gave to his brother: 7 boxes * 6 pieces/box.\n3. Subtract the number of pieces given from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces Adam has left.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will involve defining predicates to calculate the total number of pieces, the number of pieces given to the brother, and then the remaining pieces.

        "question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free. If a group of 13 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn a restaurant, the pricing structure is such that adult meals cost $7 each, while kids eat for free. A group of 13 people, including 9 kids, wants to dine at the restaurant, and we need to calculate the total cost for the group's meal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total cost, we need to consider the number of adults in the group, as only adults will incur a cost. There are 13 people in total, and 9 of them are kids, so the remaining 4 must be adults. We then multiply the number of adults by the cost of an adult meal to find the total expense.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to calculate the total cost for the group to eat based on the number of adults and the cost of an adult meal. We will use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_cost(NumAdults, CostPerAdult, TotalCost)` to calculate the total cost. Here, `NumAdults` is the number of adults in the group, `CostPerAdult` is the cost of an adult meal, and `TotalCost` is the final expense.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`) to perform the calculation for the total cost.\n3. Set up the query to find the total cost by providing the number of adults and the cost per adult meal.\n\nHere's the outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_cost(NumAdults, CostPerAdult, TotalCost) :-\n    TotalCost is NumAdults * CostPerAdult.\n\ngroup_meal_cost(NumAdults) :-\n    total_cost(NumAdults, 7, TotalCost),\n    write(TotalCost).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we first define the `total_cost/3` predicate to calculate the total cost based on the number of adults and the cost per adult meal. Then, we define the `group_meal_cost/1` predicate to calculate and print the total cost for a specific number of adults (in this case, 4 adults).

        "question": "In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 8 points. If a level has 7 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn the context of a video game, you are presented with a scenario where defeating each enemy earns you a fixed number of points. Specifically, you are awarded 8 points for each enemy you defeat. The level you are playing has a total of 7 enemies, but you manage to destroy all but two of them. The task is to calculate the number of points you will earn based on the number of enemies defeated.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of points earned, you need to consider:\n\n1. The total number of enemies in the level: 7 enemies.\n2. The number of enemies you failed to defeat: 2 enemies.\n3. The points earned per defeated enemy: 8 points.\n\nYou can calculate the points earned by subtracting the number of undefeated enemies from the total and then multiplying that difference by the points earned per enemy.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, a logical approach can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate, `defeated_enemies(TotalEnemies, Undefeated, Defeated)`, that relates the total number of enemies, the number of undefeated enemies, and the number of defeated enemies.\n2. Define another predicate, `points_earned(Defeated, PointsPerEnemy, TotalPoints)`, that calculates the total points earned based on the number of defeated enemies and the points earned per enemy.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - For the number of defeated enemies: `Defeated is TotalEnemies - Undefeated.`\n   - For the total points earned: `TotalPoints is Defeated * PointsPerEnemy.`\n4. Construct the query to find the total points earned by providing the given values:\n   - `?- points_earned(Defeated, 8, TotalPoints), defeated_enemies(7, Undefeated, Defeated).`\n5. The Prolog engine will infer the values of `Defeated` and `TotalPoints` based on the provided information.\n\nThis plan leverages Prolog's ability to perform arithmetic operations and logical inference to calculate the number of defeated enemies and the corresponding total points earned.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDave possesses a collection of video games, specifically a total of 10 games. Unfortunately, he encounters an issue where two of these games are non-functional. He intends to sell the remaining operational games for a set price of $4 per game. The objective is to determine the total amount of money he can earn from selling these functioning games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the potential earnings from selling the working video games, we need to consider:\n\n1. The total number of working games: Given that Dave initially had 10 games but 2 of them are not working, we can determine that the number of functional games is 10 - 2 = 8 games.\n2. The selling price per game: Dave plans to sell each working game for $4.\n3. Calculating total earnings: To find out how much money Dave can make, we multiply the number of working games by the selling price per game.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to compute the total number of working games and then calculate the potential earnings from selling them at the given price:\n\n1. Define a predicate `working_games` that calculates the number of functional games by subtracting the non-working games from the total:\n   - `working_games(TotalGames, WorkingGames) :- WorkingGames is TotalGames - NonWorkingGames.`\n2. Create a predicate `earning` to compute the total earnings by multiplying the number of working games by the selling price:\n   - `earning(WorkingGames, PricePerGame, TotalEarning) :- TotalEarning is WorkingGames * PricePerGame.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the total earnings:\n   - `?- earning(WorkingGames, Price, TotalEarnings).`\n4. The code will utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations and determine Dave's potential earnings from selling the working video games.\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog, leveraging the language's arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given conditions.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIsabel has baked three brownies, but she requires a total of five brownies for her party. She used five cups of flour for each brownie she baked. The problem is to determine how many additional cups of flour she needs to bake the remaining brownies for her party.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the solution, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total number of brownies Isabel still needs to bake for her party: 5 total brownies - 3 baked brownies = 2 brownies.\n2. Determine the number of cups of flour used for each brownie: 5 cups/brownie.\n3. Calculate the total amount of flour Isabel has already used: 3 baked brownies * 5 cups/brownie = 15 cups.\n4. To find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the total amount of flour used from the total required for all five brownies: Total required (5 brownies * 5 cups/brownie) - Total used (15 cups).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of cups of flour Isabel still needs. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `flour_needed(BakedBrownies, TotalBrownies, CupsPerBrownie, FlourNeeded)` that relates the number of baked brownies, the total number of brownies needed, the cups of flour per brownie, and the amount of flour still needed.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining brownies by subtracting `BakedBrownies` from `TotalBrownies`.\n3. Calculate the total amount of flour used by multiplying `BakedBrownies` by `CupsPerBrownie`.\n4. Calculate `FlourNeeded` by subtracting the total amount of flour used from the total required flour for all `TotalBrownies`.\n5. Implement the rule in SWI-Prolog using arithmetic operations.\n\nHere's the SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\nflour_needed(BakedBrownies, TotalBrownies, CupsPerBrownie, FlourNeeded) :-\n    RemainingBrownies is TotalBrownies - BakedBrownies,\n    TotalFlourUsed is BakedBrownies * CupsPerBrownie,\n    FlourNeeded is (TotalBrownies * CupsPerBrownie) - TotalFlourUsed.\n```\n\nNow, we can query this rule with the given values to find out how many cups of flour Isabel still needs:\n\n```prolog\nquery_flour_needed(FlourNeeded) :-\n    flour_needed(3, 5, 5, FlourNeeded).\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and return the number of cups of flour Isabel requires to bake the remaining brownies for her party.",

        "question": "At lunch a waiter had 7 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $3 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, a waiter serves 7 customers during lunch, and only a small number of them leave a tip. Specifically, 5 customers did not leave a tip, and we want to calculate how much money the waiter earned from the remaining tipped customers. We are given that each tipping customer left $3. The task is to determine the total amount of money the waiter earned from the tips.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the number of customers who left a tip and then multiply that by the tip amount per customer. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Number of Tipping Customers**: Given that 5 customers did not leave a tip, we can find the number of tipping customers by subtracting 5 from the total number of customers: 7 - 5 = 2 customers.\n2. **Tip Amount per Customer**: Each tipping customer left a tip of $3.\n3. **Total Earnings from Tips**: To find out how much money the waiter earned from the tips, we multiply the number of tipping customers by the tip amount per customer: Total Earnings = Number of Tipping Customers * Tip Amount per Customer.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can define a predicate that calculates the total earnings from tips based on the given information. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate `calculate_total_earnings(NumberOfCustomers, TipAmountPerCustomer, TotalEarnings)` that takes the total number of customers, the tip amount per tipping customer, and computes the total earnings from tips.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicate to perform calculations:\n     - Calculate the number of tipping customers by subtracting the non-tippers from the total customers.\n     - Compute the total earnings by multiplying the number of tippers by the tip amount per customer.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `calculate_total_earnings` predicate with the given values (7 customers, $3 tip amount per customer) to determine the total amount of money the waiter earned from the tips.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total earnings from tips\ncalculate_total_earnings(NumberOfCustomers, TipAmountPerCustomer, TotalEarnings) :-\n    NumberOfTippingCustomers is NumberOfCustomers - 5,\n    TotalEarnings is NumberOfTippingCustomers * TipAmountPerCustomer.\n\n% Query to find the total earnings for 7 customers with a $3 tip amount per customer\nquery_total_earnings(TotalEarnings) :-\n    calculate_total_earnings(7, 3, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nBy executing the `query_total_earnings(TotalEarnings)` query, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the total amount of money the waiter earned from the tips during lunch.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given information about the number of members on a trivia team and their attendance during a game. Specifically, the team had 9 members in total, but 3 members did not show up for the game. We want to calculate the total number of points scored by the team, knowing that each member who attended the game scored 2 points.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of members who showed up for the game. Since 3 members did not show up out of a total of 9, the number of members present is 9 - 3 = 6.\n2. Each member who attended the game scored 2 points. To find the total number of points scored, we multiply the number of members present by the points scored per member: Total points = Number of members present * Points per member.\n3. Perform the multiplication to calculate the total number of points scored by the team.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of points scored based on the given information. Here's the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_points_scored(NumberOfMembers, PointsPerMember, TotalPoints)` that takes the number of members and the points scored per member as input and computes the total number of points scored.\n2. Calculate the number of members who showed up by subtracting the number of absent members from the total number of members.\n3. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the points scored per member.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total points scored\ntotal_points_scored(NumberOfMembers, PointsPerMember, TotalPoints) :-\n    NumberOfPresentMembers is NumberOfMembers - 3,\n    TotalPoints is NumberOfPresentMembers * PointsPerMember.\n\n% Query to find the total points scored when there are 9 members and each scores 2 points\nquery_total_points(TotalPoints) :-\n    total_points_scored(9, 2, TotalPoints).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_total_points(TotalPoints)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the total number of points scored by the team based on the given conditions.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMike possesses 15 video games, among which only 6 are functional. He intends to sell these working games for a price of $5 each. The objective is to compute the total amount of money he will earn from selling these operational games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo resolve this issue, we must execute the subsequent phases:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Functional Games**: Out of Mike's 15 video games, 9 are non-functional, leaving him with 6 working games.\n2. **Compute the Potential Earnings**: If each functioning game is sold for $5, we can determine the potential revenue by multiplying the number of working games by the selling price.\n3. **Total Earnings**: This computation will yield the total amount of money Mike can generate by selling his operational video games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe implementation in SWI-Prolog involves defining a rule that computes the total earnings based on the given parameters. Here's a comprehensive plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_games/2` to represent the total number of video games.\n   - `non_working_games/2` to specify the number of non-functional games.\n   - `working_games/2` to calculate the count of operational games.\n   - `selling_price/2` to hold the selling price per game.\n   - `potential_earnings/3` to compute the potential revenue from selling working games.\n   - `total_earnings/2` to calculate the final amount earned.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Utilize facts and rules to define each predicate, adhering to the analysis provided.\n   - Employ arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform the necessary calculations.\n   - Establish relationships between the predicates to derive the final answer.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of games and the selling price to ensure that the output aligns with the expected total earnings (sum of selling prices for working games).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with distinct predicates that align with each analytical step, we can effectively resolve the problem.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMike has earned some money mowing lawns over the summer, and he wants to know how many $6 games he can buy with his remaining money after purchasing mower blades. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of money he has left after spending some of his earnings.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n\n1. Mike made $101 mowing lawns.\n2. He spent $47 on mower blades.\n3. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost of the mower blades from his total earnings: $101 - $47 = $54.\n4. Now, we need to determine how many $6 games he can buy with this remaining amount.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a predicate `money_left(Earned, Spent, Remaining)` that calculates the remaining money after earning a certain amount and spending some of it.\n2. Define another predicate `games_bought(Remaining, GamePrice, NumberOfGames)` that calculates the number of games Mike can buy with his remaining money.\n3. Implement the predicates with the given values:\n   - `Earned` is 101 dollars.\n   - `Spent` is 47 dollars.\n   - `Remaining` will be calculated using the `money_left` predicate.\n   - `GamePrice` is 6 dollars.\n   - `NumberOfGames` will be calculated using the `games_bought` predicate.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations:\n   ```prolog\n   money_left(Earned, Spent, Remaining) :-\n       Earned >= Spent,\n       Remaining is Earned - Spent.\n   ```\n   ```prolog\n   games_bought(Remaining, GamePrice, NumberOfGames) :-\n       Remaining >= 0,\n       NumberOfGames is floor(Remaining / GamePrice).\n   ```\n5. Query the predicates to get the final result:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- money_left(101, 47, Remaining), games_bought(Remaining, 6, NumberOfGames).\n   ```\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively use SWI-Prolog to calculate the number of $6 games Mike can buy with his remaining money.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMegan has a homework assignment with a total of 40 problems. She has completed 26 problems but still has 2 full pages of problems left to finish. The goal is to determine how many problems are on each page, assuming that each page has an equal number of problems. This problem involves distributing the remaining problems evenly across the two pages.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Megan has completed 26 problems out of the total 40 problems.\n2. She has 2 full pages left to complete, and we want to find the number of problems on each page.\n3. Let 'x' represent the number of problems on each page. Then, the total number of problems left can be calculated as 2 times 'x'.\n4. Set up an equation: 2x + 26 = 40, where 2x represents the remaining problems on the 2 pages.\n5. Solve for 'x' to find the number of problems on each page.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule to calculate the number of problems on each page based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `problems_per_page` that takes three parameters: the total number of problems (`TotalProblems`), the number of completed problems (`CompletedProblems`), and the number of problems on each page (`ProblemsPerPage`).\n2. Calculate the remaining problems by subtracting the completed problems from the total problems: `RemainingProblems` is `TotalProblems` - `CompletedProblems`.\n3. Determine the relationship between the remaining problems and the number of problems per page. Since there are 2 pages left, `RemainingProblems` is equal to 2 times `ProblemsPerPage`.\n4. Set up an equation to find `ProblemsPerPage`: `RemainingProblems` is unified with 2 * `ProblemsPerPage`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for `ProblemsPerPage`: `ProblemsPerPage` is `RemainingProblems` // 2.\n6. The rule `problems_per_page/3` will infer the value of `ProblemsPerPage` based on the given inputs.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate problems per page\nproblems_per_page(TotalProblems, CompletedProblems, ProblemsPerPage) :-\n    RemainingProblems is TotalProblems - CompletedProblems,\n    RemainingProblems = 2 * ProblemsPerPage,\n    ProblemsPerPage is RemainingProblems // 2.\n\n% Example query to find the number of problems on each page\n% ?- problems_per_page(40, 26, ProblemsPerPage).\n% This should output the number of problems on each page.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of problems on each page, distributing the remaining problems evenly, and demonstrates how Prolog can be used to solve basic arithmetic and logical problems through rule-based reasoning.",

        "question": "Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend\u2019s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWendy has collected flowers to create bouquets for her friend's wedding. Initially, she had 103 flowers, but due to some unforeseen circumstances, 47 of them wilted, and she was left with a smaller number. She wants to know how many bouquets of 8 flowers each she can make with the remaining flowers. To find the answer, we need to calculate the number of flowers she has after the wilting incident and then determine how many complete bouquets she can assemble.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the number of flowers remaining after 47 wilted: Subtract 47 from the initial count of 103 flowers.\n2. Determine the number of complete bouquets she can make: Divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet (8).\n3. Interpret the result: The whole number from the division will give us the number of complete bouquets, and if there's a remainder, it will represent the flowers left over that aren't enough for another bouquet.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of bouquets Wendy can make based on the number of flowers she has left after the wilting incident. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. **Define the Rule**: Create a rule named `bouquets/2` that takes the initial count of flowers (`InitialFlowers`) and the number of flowers needed for each bouquet (`FlowersPerBouquet`) as input parameters.\n2. **Calculate Remaining Flowers**: Use arithmetic operations to find out how many flowers are left after some wilted. You can subtract the wilted flowers from the initial count: `RemainingFlowers is InitialFlowers - WiltedFlowers`.\n3. **Determine the Number of Bouquets**: Divide the `RemainingFlowers` by `FlowersPerBouquet` to find out how many complete bouquets she can make. Use integer division (`//` in SWI-Prolog) to ensure we get a whole number: `NumBouquets is RemainingFlowers // FlowersPerBouquet`.\n4. **Handle the Remainder**: If there are remaining flowers that aren't enough for another bouquet, you can include this information in the output. Calculate the remainder using the mod operator (`Mod` in SWI-Prolog): `Remaining is RemainingFlowers mod FlowersPerBouquet`.\n5. **Test the Rule**: Query the `bouquets/2` rule with the given values to find out how many bouquets Wendy can make.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that reflects this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of bouquets\nbouquets(InitialFlowers, FlowersPerBouquet, NumBouquets, Remaining) :-\n    WiltedFlowers is 47,\n    RemainingFlowers is InitialFlowers - WiltedFlowers,\n    NumBouquets is RemainingFlowers // FlowersPerBouquet,\n    Remaining is RemainingFlowers mod FlowersPerBouquet.\n\n% Example query to find out how many bouquets Wendy can make\n% ?- bouquets(103, 8, NumBouquets, Remaining).\n% This should output the number of bouquets and the remaining flowers.\n```\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively use SWI-Prolog to solve the problem and find out the number of bouquets Wendy can create with the remaining flowers after accounting for the wilted ones.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily's team won a dodgeball game with a significant point advantage. The team's total score was 39 points, and Emily herself scored 23 of those points. The remaining players on the team each scored 2 points. The task is to determine how many players, including Emily, were on the team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of players on Emily's team, we can use the information about the total score and the individual scores of Emily and the other players:\n\n1. **Emily's Score**: Emily scored 23 points.\n2. **Other Players' Scores**: The remaining players each scored 2 points. This implies that the total number of players, excluding Emily, contributed 2 points each to the total score.\n3. **Total Score**: The team's total score was 39 points, which includes Emily's score and the scores of the other players.\n4. **Calculating the Number of Players**: To find the number of players on the team, we can use the information about the total score and the scores of the other players. First, we calculate the total score contributed by the other players (excluding Emily) by subtracting Emily's score from the total score. Then, we divide this total score by the number of players, assuming each player scored 2 points.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of players on Emily's team based on the given total score and individual scores.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe company invited 47 people to a luncheon, but 7 of the invitees did not attend. To determine the number of tables needed, we want to calculate how many groups of 5 attendees can be formed from the attendees, as each table holds 5 people. The problem involves finding the number of whole groups that can be formed from the attendees, and it can be solved using division.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Attendees**: There are 47 invited, but 7 did not show up, so the total number of attendees is 47 - 7 = 40.\n\n2. **Tables Needed for Attendees**: To find out how many tables are required, we need to divide the total number of attendees by the capacity of each table (5 people). This calculation will give us the minimum number of tables needed to accommodate all attendees.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of tables needed based on the total attendees and the capacity of each table. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_attendees/2` to represent the total number of attendees, given the invited and absent counts.\n   - `tables_needed/3` to calculate the number of tables required, given the total attendees and the capacity of each table.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the `total_attendees/2` predicate to calculate the number of attendees.\n   - In the `tables_needed/3` predicate, use integer division (`//`) to calculate the number of tables. Integer division ensures that we get a whole number of tables, discarding any fractional part.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of invited people and absent people, and check if the output matches the expected number of tables needed.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total number of attendees\ntotal_attendees(Invited, Absent, Attendees) :-\n    Attendees is Invited - Absent.\n\n% Calculate the number of tables needed\ntables_needed(Attendees, Capacity, TablesNeeded) :-\n    TablesNeeded is ceiling(Attendees / Capacity).\n\n% Example query to calculate the number of tables needed\n?- total_attendees(47, 7, Attendees), tables_needed(Attendees, 5, TablesNeeded).\n% This should output the number of tables needed.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of tables required for the given number of attendees, demonstrating the use of arithmetic operations and logical rules in SWI-Prolog to solve practical problems.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIsabel has a collection of 25 pictures that she wants to organize into several albums on Facebook. She starts by placing 10 pictures into one album, and then she distributes the remaining pictures into five additional albums. The task is to determine how many pictures are in each of these albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven Isabel's actions, we can analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. Isabel first selects 10 pictures for one album, leaving 15 pictures unselected (`25 total pictures - 10 selected pictures = 15 remaining pictures`).\n2. She then distributes the remaining 15 pictures into five separate albums.\n3. To find the number of pictures in each of the five albums, we divide the total remaining pictures by the number of albums: `15 pictures / 5 albums = 3 pictures per album`.\n\nTherefore, after the initial selection of 10 pictures, each of the remaining albums will contain 3 pictures.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the distribution of pictures into albums based on the given constraints. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a rule \"picture_distribution\" that takes variables for the total number of pictures, the number of pictures in the first album, the number of additional albums, and the number of pictures in each of those albums.\n2. Calculate the remaining number of pictures after placing some in the first album (`TotalPictures - FirstAlbumPictures = RemainingPictures`).\n3. Determine the number of pictures in each of the additional albums by dividing the remaining pictures by the number of additional albums (`RemainingPictures / NumAdditionalAlbums = PicturesPerAlbum`).\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and infer the distribution of pictures.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\npicture_distribution(TotalPictures, FirstAlbumPictures, NumAdditionalAlbums, PicturesPerAlbum) :-\n    RemainingPictures is TotalPictures - FirstAlbumPictures,\n    PicturesPerAlbum is RemainingPictures // NumAdditionalAlbums.\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `is` operator for arithmetic evaluation, and `//` for integer division. By querying this rule with the given values, SWI-Prolog will infer the number of pictures in each album, demonstrating how Prolog can model and solve simple distribution problems.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKatie's dodgeball team won a game with a total of 12 points scored. Katie contributed 4 points, and all other team members each scored 4 points as well. The objective is to determine the number of players on Katie's team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of players on Katie's team, we can set up and solve a simple equation based on the information provided:\n\n- Let 'x' be the number of other players on Katie's team.\n- Each other player scored 4 points, so the total score from them is 4x points.\n- Katie's score was 4 points, as given in the question.\n- The total score of the team is the sum of Katie's score and the score of the other players: 4 + 4x.\n- According to the question, the team's total score is 12 points.\n\nSo, the equation to find the number of players becomes:\n4 + 4x = 12\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can construct a predicate that represents the equation and then query it to find the solution:\n\n1. Define a predicate, `team_size(X)`, where `X` is the number of other players on Katie's team.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMegan initially baked 71 cupcakes, but her brother, Todd, consumed 43 of them, leaving a remainder for packaging. The task is to determine how many packages of cupcakes Megan can create if she allocates seven cupcakes to each package.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves calculating the number of complete packages Megan can make and considering whether there will be any cupcakes left over after forming these packages. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n1. Calculate the number of cupcakes remaining after Todd's indulgence: 71 initial cupcakes - 43 eaten by Todd = 28 cupcakes.\n2. Determine the number of complete packages: Divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per package. In this case, 28 cupcakes / 7 cupcakes per package = 4 packages.\n3. Examine whether there are any remaining cupcakes by taking the modulus of the division in step 2. If there's a remainder, it represents the number of cupcakes that don't fit into the packages.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of packages Megan can make and also determines if there are any leftover cupcakes. Here's an outline of the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule \"cupcake_packages\" that accepts the initial number of cupcakes, the number eaten by Todd, the number of cupcakes per package, and two variables for the number of packages and any leftover cupcakes.\n2. Calculate the remaining cupcakes after Todd's indulgence.\n3. Compute the number of packages by dividing the remaining cupcakes by the cupcakes per package, using integer division.\n4.

Define a predicate `fresh_flowers(TotalFlowers, WiltedFlowers, FreshFlowers)` that calculates the number of fresh flowers remaining after some have wilted:\n   - `fresh_flowers(Total, Wilted, Fresh) :- Fresh is Total - Wilted.`\n2. Define a predicate `make_bouquets(FreshFlowers, FlowersPerBouquet, NumBouquets)` that calculates the number of bouquets that can be made with the fresh flowers:\n   - `make_bouquets(Fresh, PerBouquet, NumBouquets) :- NumBouquets is floor(Fresh / PerBouquet).`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the number of bouquets Wendy can make:\n   - `?- fresh_flowers(45, 35, Fresh), make_bouquets(Fresh, 5, NumBouquets).`\n\nThe code will use arithmetic operations and the `floor/1` function to round down the result of the division, ensuring an integer result for the number of bouquets.",

This can be calculated by dividing the total number of remaining files by the number of files per folder.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to calculate the number of folders Wendy ends up with after deleting and organizing her files. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `files_after_deletion(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, RemainingFiles)` to calculate the number of files remaining after deletion:\n   ```prolog\n   files_after_deletion(Total, Deleted, Remaining) :-\n       Remaining is Total - Deleted.\n   ```\n2. Define a predicate `files_to_folders(RemainingFiles, FilesPerFolder, NumFolders)` to calculate the number of folders required to organize the remaining files:\n   ```prolog\n   files_to_folders(Remaining, FilesPerFolder, NumFolders) :-\n       NumFolders is ceil(Remaining / FilesPerFolder).\n   ```\n   The `ceil/2` function is used to round up the result of the division to ensure that even if there are files remaining that don't evenly divide into the folders, we still account for an additional folder.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the number of folders:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- files_after_deletion(82, 37, Remaining), files_to_folders(Remaining, 5, NumFolders).\n   ```\n4. The code will perform the calculations for the number of files remaining after deletion and then determine the minimum number of folders needed to accommodate those files, given that each folder contains five files.\n\nThis plan uses SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to calculate the number of folders required to organize Wendy's remaining files after deletion.",

        "question": "Nancy uploaded 51 pictures to Facebook. She put 11 pics into one album and put the rest into 8 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, Nancy has uploaded a total of 51 pictures to Facebook and organized them into several albums. She placed 11 pictures into one album, and the remaining pictures were distributed across 8 other albums. The task is to determine how many pictures are in each of these albums, including the one with 11 pictures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven that Nancy uploaded a total of $51$ pictures and $11$ of them are in one album, we can calculate the number of pictures left for the other $8$ albums. This can be done by subtracting the number of pictures in the first album from the total: $51$ (total pictures) - $11$ (pictures in the first album) = $40$ pictures left. Now, we know there are $8$ albums, so we can divide the remaining $40$ pictures equally among them. This gives us $5$ pictures per album.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to calculate the distribution of pictures among the albums. Here's a plan for the code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_pictures(Total)` to represent the total number of pictures Nancy uploaded.\n2. Define another predicate `pictures_in_album(Album, Count)` to represent the number of pictures in each album. This predicate will have two arguments: the album we are interested in and the corresponding picture count.\n3. Use arithmetic calculations to find the number of pictures left for the other albums after placing $11$ pictures in the first album. This can be calculated as `TotalPictures - 11`.\n4. Calculate the number of pictures in each of the remaining albums by dividing the remaining pictures by the number of albums. This can be computed as `PicturesPerAlbum` is `(TotalPictures - 11) / 8`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find out the number of pictures in each album. Provide the total number of pictures as input and use logical inference to calculate the distribution.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of pictures\ntotal_pictures(51).\n\n% Define pictures in the first album\npictures_in_album(first_album, 11).\n\n% Calculate pictures per album for the rest of the albums\npictures_in_album(Album, PicturesPerAlbum) :-\n    total_pictures(TotalPictures),\n    RemainingPictures is TotalPictures - 11,\n    PicturesPerAlbum is RemainingPictures / 8.\n\n% Sample query to find pictures in an album\n% ?- pictures_in_album(Album, Pictures).\n```\n\nThis code defines the total number of pictures and the pictures in the first album directly. It then uses arithmetic calculations to find the number of pictures in the remaining albums. The query can be used to find the picture count for a specific album or to iterate over all albums to get their respective picture counts.",
