                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nAlec is aiming to secure three-quarters of the votes from his class of 60 students to ensure a win in the election for Class President. He has already received commitments from half the class and is working to persuade additional voters. The task involves calculating the total number of votes Alec has secured and determining how many additional votes he needs to reach his goal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Votes Required**: Alec needs three-quarters of the total class votes.\n   - Total class size = 60\n   - Required votes = 3/4 of 60 = 45 votes\n\n2. **Current Votes Secured**: Half of the class has already agreed to vote for Alec.\n   - Votes from half the class = 1/2 of 60 = 30 votes\n\n3. **Additional Votes from Undecided Students**: Out of the remaining students, only 5 were considering voting for him initially. After further campaigning, a fifth of the remaining students (who were not already considering him) decided to vote for him.\n   - Remaining students after 30 commitments = 60 - 30 = 30 students\n   - Initially undecided but considering = 5\n   - Remaining students not considering Alec initially = 30 - 5 = 25\n   - Additional votes after campaigning = 1/5 of 25 = 5 votes\n\n4. **Total Votes After Campaigning**: Sum of votes from committed and persuaded students.\n   - Total votes after initial and additional campaigning = 30 (initially committed) + 5 (initially undecided) + 5 (converted from non-considering) = 40 votes\n\n5. **Votes Needed to Reach Goal**: Subtract the total votes Alec has from the required votes.\n   - Additional votes needed = 45 (goal) - 40 (current) = 5 votes\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how many more votes Alec needs based on the input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_students/1` to hold the total number of students.\n   - `votes_required/2` to calculate the number of votes needed to win.\n   - `initial_votes/2` to calculate the votes Alec initially secured.\n   - `undecided_votes/2` to calculate the votes from students initially undecided.\n   - `additional_campaign_votes/3` to calculate the additional votes from non-considering students after campaigning.\n   - `total_current_votes/2` to sum up all votes Alec has after campaigning.\n   - `votes_needed/3` to calculate how many more votes Alec needs to reach his goal.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of students and check if the output matches the expected number of additional votes needed (5 votes).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values."

The task is to calculate the total cost of the meal and then determine how much each friend must pay if the bill is split equally among them. The items ordered include a Taco Salad, Dave's Single hamburgers, sets of french fries, and cups of peach lemonade, each with specific costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much each friend pays, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each item:\n   - Taco Salad: $10\n   - Dave's Single hamburgers: 5 orders at $5 each = $25\n   - French fries: 4 sets at $2.50 each = $10\n   - Peach lemonade: 5 cups at $2 each = $10\n\n2. Sum up these costs to get the total bill:\n   - Total bill = $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (Hamburgers) + $10 (Fries) + $10 (Lemonade) = $55\n\n3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend pays:\n   - Each friend pays = Total bill / 5\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_bill\" that takes variables for each item's cost and the number of friends.\n2. Assign constants to the costs of individual items (e.g., cost of Taco Salad, cost of a hamburger).\n3. Compute the total cost for each type of item by multiplying the unit cost with the quantity ordered.\n4. Sum up all these total costs to get the final bill.\n5. Divide the final bill by the number of friends to determine how much each friend pays.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define costs of items\nitem_cost(taco_salad, 10).\nitem_cost(hamburger, 5).\nitem_cost(fries, 2.5).\nitem_cost(lemonade, 2).\n\n% Calculate total cost of an item type\ntotal_item_cost(Item, Quantity, TotalCost) :-\n    item_cost(Item, CostPerItem),\n    TotalCost is CostPerItem * Quantity.\n\n% Calculate the total bill and how much each friend pays\ncalculate_bill(NumFriends, EachPays) :-\n    total_item_cost(taco_salad, 1, TotalTacoSalad),\n    total_item_cost(hamburger, 5, TotalHamburgers),\n    total_item_cost(fries, 4, TotalFries),\n    total_item_cost(lemonade, 5, TotalLemonade),\n    TotalBill is TotalTacoSalad + TotalHamburgers + TotalFries + TotalLemonade,\n    EachPays is TotalBill / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost of each item, calculates the total cost for each type of item based on the quantity, sums these to get the total bill, and finally computes the amount each friend pays by dividing the total bill by the number of friends."

To determine the total time taken to complete all these activities, we need to sum up the time spent on each activity. These activities include getting in shape, learning mountain climbing, climbing the seven summits, learning diving, and diving through caves.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Getting in shape: 2 years.\n2. Learning mountain climbing: Twice the time taken to get in shape, i.e., 2 * 2 = 4 years.\n3. Climbing the seven summits: Each summit takes 5 months to climb, so for seven summits, 7 * 5 = 35 months. Since 12 months make a year, this is equivalent to 35 / 12 \u2248 2.92 years.\n4. Learning to dive: 13 months, which is 13 / 12 \u2248 1.08 years.\n5. Diving through caves: 2 years.\n\nTo find the total time spent, we need to sum all these durations.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total time taken based on the given durations for each activity. Prolog's arithmetic capabilities will be used to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nThe blueprint to create a SWI-Prolog code for this scenario is as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_time` that takes variables for each activity duration and calculates the total time.\n2. Convert months to years where necessary to maintain consistency in units.\n3. Sum up the durations to get the total time.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n1. Define a predicate `convert_months_to_years(Months, Years)` that converts months to years.\n2. Define a predicate `total_bucket_list_duration(GettingInShape, LearningClimbing, ClimbingSummits, LearningDiving, DivingCaves, TotalYears)` where:\n   - `GettingInShape` is 2 (years),\n   - `LearningClimbing` is 4 (years),\n   - `ClimbingSummits` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `LearningDiving` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `DivingCaves` is 2 (years),\n   - `TotalYears` is the sum of all the above durations.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`) to perform the calculations and Prolog's logical inference to ensure the correct flow of data.\n\nThis structured approach leverages Prolog's capabilities to solve the problem through logical inference and arithmetic calculations, providing a clear and concise solution."

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on similar items.

Calculate Sara's total expenditure by adding the cost of the shoes and the dress.\n2. Double Sara's expenditure to determine Rachel's budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of Rachel's budget based on the expenses of Sara. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent)` which calculates the total amount spent by Sara. This rule will take the cost of the shoes and the dress as input and output the total spent.\n   \n2. Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget. This rule will take the total spent by Sara as input and output the budget for Rachel by doubling Sara's expenditure.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (ShoesCost as $50 and DressCost as $200) and use them to compute the desired budget for Rachel.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `RachelBudget` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define how much Sara spent\ntotal_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent) :-\n    TotalSpent is ShoesCost + DressCost.\n\n% Define Rachel's budget as twice what Sara spent\nbudget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget) :-\n    RachelBudget is 2 * SaraSpent.\n\n% Sample query to find Rachel's budget\n% ?- total_spent_by_sara(50, 200, SaraSpent), budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total spent by Sara and then calculates Rachel's budget based on Sara's expenditure.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Haley and her mom picked a total of 39 + 38 = 77 carrots. However, only 64 of these carrots were good, meaning that the remaining carrots were bad. The task is to determine the number of bad carrots they had.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of bad carrots, we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked by Haley and her mom.\n\n1.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_bad_carrots` that takes the number of carrots picked by Haley and her mom, as well as the number of good carrots, and calculates the number of bad carrots.\n2. Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked to find the number of bad carrots.\n3. Define the predicates with the actual values provided in the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nBy following this plan, we can use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to compute the number of bad carrots based on the given data and logical inference to derive the solution.\n\nLet's construct the Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\ncalculate_bad_carrots(HaleyPicked, MomPicked, GoodCarrots, BadCarrots) :-\n    TotalCarrots is HaleyPicked + MomPicked,\n    BadCarrots is TotalCarrots - GoodCarrots.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively calculates the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving simple arithmetic operations and constraints.",

        "question": "Wendy was playing a video game and had 43 lives. In a hard part of the game she lost 8 lives. If she got 39 more lives in the next level, how many lives would she have?",

She loses 8 lives during a difficult part of the game and then gains 39 more lives in the next level. We need to determine how many lives Wendy will have after these events.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Wendy starts with 43 lives.\n2. She loses 8 lives, so we subtract 8 from her current total.\n3. In the next level, she gains 39 lives, so we add 39 to her total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Wendy's total number of lives after losing 8 lives and gaining 39 lives. Here's how we can structure the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_lives(StartingLives, LostLives, GainedLives, TotalLives)` that takes the starting number of lives, the number of lives lost, the number of lives gained, and calculates the total number of lives.\n2. Subtract the number of lives lost from the starting number of lives.\n3. Add the number of lives gained to the result obtained in step 2 to get the total number of lives.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of lives\ncalculate_lives(StartingLives, LostLives, GainedLives, TotalLives) :-\n    TempLives is StartingLives - LostLives,\n    TotalLives is TempLives + GainedLives.\n\n% Query to find Wendy's total number of lives\nquery_total_lives(TotalLives) :-\n    calculate_lives(43, 8, 39, TotalLives).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to determine Wendy's total number of lives after losing 8 lives and gaining 39 lives.

Find the total number of winter clothing pieces by adding the total scarves and mittens: 21 scarves + 28 mittens = Total winter clothing pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of winter clothing pieces based on the given quantities of scarves and mittens in each box. Here's the structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_winter_clothing_pieces(Total)` that calculates the total number of winter clothing pieces.\n2. Assign constants for the number of scarves and mittens per box.\n3. Calculate the total number of scarves by multiplying the number of boxes with the scarves per box.\n4. Calculate the total number of mittens by multiplying the number of boxes with the mittens per box.\n5. Sum up the total scarves and mittens to get the total winter clothing pieces.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of winter clothing pieces\ntotal_winter_clothing_pieces(Total) :-\n    ScarvesPerBox = 3,\n    MittensPerBox = 4,\n    Boxes = 7,\n    TotalScarves is ScarvesPerBox * Boxes,\n    TotalMittens is MittensPerBox * Boxes,\n    Total is TotalScarves + TotalMittens.\n\n% Query to find the total number of winter clothing pieces\nquery_total_winter_clothing_pieces(Total) :-\n    total_winter_clothing_pieces(Total).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to determine the total number of winter clothing pieces Rachel has. By querying `query_total_winter_clothing_pieces(Total)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the total count based on the given quantities of scarves and mittens in each box.",

Add the number of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins: 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of coins based on the given information. Here's the structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_coins(Total)` that calculates the total number of coins.\n2. Define constants for the number of piles of quarters and dimes, as well as the number of coins per pile.\n3. Calculate the total number of quarters by multiplying the number of piles of quarters with the coins per pile.\n4. Calculate the total number of dimes by multiplying the number of piles of dimes with the coins per pile.\n5. Sum up the total number of quarters and dimes to get the total number of coins.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of coins\ntotal_coins(Total) :-\n    QuartersPiles = 5,\n    DimesPiles = 5,\n    CoinsPerPile = 3,\n    TotalQuarters is QuartersPiles * CoinsPerPile,\n    TotalDimes is DimesPiles * CoinsPerPile,\n    Total is TotalQuarters + TotalDimes.\n\n% Query to find the total number of coins\nquery_total_coins(Total) :-\n    total_coins(Total).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to determine the total number of coins Luke has in all the piles.

Calculate the total number of mystery books by multiplying the number of mystery shelves by the number of books per shelf (5 shelves * 6 books per shelf).\n2. Calculate the total number of picture books by multiplying the number of picture book shelves by the number of books per shelf (4 shelves * 6 books per shelf).\n3. Add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the overall total number of books in Chloe's bookcase.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates and rules to calculate the total number of books based on the given information. Here's how we can structure the plan:\n\n1. Define predicates for the number of mystery shelves, number of picture book shelves, and the number of books per shelf.\n2. Calculate the total number of mystery books and picture books using these predicates.\n3. Define a rule to calculate the total number of books by summing the total number of mystery books and picture books.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and return the total number of books.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of shelves and books per shelf\nmystery_shelves(5).\npicture_book_shelves(4).\nbooks_per_shelf(6).\n\n% Calculate the total number of mystery books\ntotal_mystery_books(TotalMysteryBooks) :-\n    mystery_shelves(MysteryShelves),\n    books_per_shelf(BooksPerShelf),\n    TotalMysteryBooks is MysteryShelves * BooksPerShelf.\n\n% Calculate the total number of picture books\ntotal_picture_books(TotalPictureBooks) :-\n    picture_book_shelves(PictureBookShelves),\n    books_per_shelf(BooksPerShelf),\n    TotalPictureBooks is PictureBookShelves * BooksPerShelf.\n\n% Calculate the total number of books in Chloe's bookcase\ntotal_books(TotalBooks) :-\n    total_mystery_books(TotalMysteryBooks),\n    total_picture_books(TotalPictureBooks),\n    TotalBooks is TotalMysteryBooks + TotalPictureBooks.\n```\n\nThis code defines the necessary predicates and rules to calculate the total number of books in Chloe's bookcase based on the given information.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Adam purchased 2 boxes of chocolate candy and 5 boxes of caramel candy. Each box contains 4 pieces of candy. The task is to calculate the total number of candies that Adam has in total by considering the number of boxes and pieces per box.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of candies Adam has, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chocolate candies by multiplying the number of boxes of chocolate candy by the number of pieces per box.\n2. Calculate the total number of caramel candies by multiplying the number of boxes of caramel candy by the number of pieces per box.\n3. Sum up the total number of chocolate candies and caramel candies to find the overall total number of candies that Adam has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the total number of candies. The plan will involve setting up predicates for each type of candy, calculating the total number of candies for each type, and then summing them up to find the total.\n\n1. Define predicates for the number of boxes and pieces per box for chocolate candy and caramel candy.\n2. Define predicates to calculate the total number of chocolate candies and caramel candies based on the number of boxes and pieces per box.\n3. Define a predicate to calculate the total number of candies by summing up the total chocolate candies and total caramel candies.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and return the total number of candies.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of boxes and pieces per box for chocolate and caramel candies\nboxes(chocolate, 2).\nboxes(caramel, 5).\npieces_per_box(4).\n\n% Calculate the total number of candies for each type\ntotal_candies(Type, Total) :-\n    boxes(Type, Boxes),\n    pieces_per_box(PiecesPerBox),\n    Total is Boxes * PiecesPerBox.\n\n% Calculate the total number of candies Adam has\ntotal_candies_adam(TotalCandies) :-\n    total_candies(chocolate, TotalChocolate),\n    total_candies(caramel, TotalCaramel),\n    TotalCandies is TotalChocolate + TotalCaramel.\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the number of boxes and pieces per box for each type of candy, calculate the total number of candies for each type, and then sum them up to find the total number of candies that Adam has.

Define a predicate `calculate_score(Level1Treasures, Level2Treasures, PointsPerTreasure, TotalScore)` that calculates Tiffany's total score.\n2. Calculate the score for the first level by multiplying `Level1Treasures` by `PointsPerTreasure`.\n3.

        "question": "Chloe was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 6 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second, what would her score be?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Chloe earns 9 points for each treasure she finds in the video game. She found 6 treasures on the first level and 3 treasures on the second level. To calculate Chloe's total score, we need to multiply the number of treasures found on each level by the points earned per treasure and then sum these values.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Chloe's total score, we can follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the score earned on the first level by multiplying the number of treasures found on the first level (6) by the points per treasure (9).\n2. Calculate the score earned on the second level by multiplying the number of treasures found on the second level (3) by the points per treasure (9).\n3. Add the scores from both levels to find Chloe's total score.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this calculation in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that computes Chloe's total score based on the number of treasures found on each level and the points earned per treasure. Here's a structured plan for writing the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_score(Level1Treasures, Level2Treasures, PointsPerTreasure, TotalScore)` that takes the number of treasures found on each level, the points earned per treasure, and calculates Chloe's total score.\n   \n2. Calculate the score earned on the first level by multiplying `Level1Treasures` by `PointsPerTreasure`.\n   \n3. Calculate the score earned on the second level by multiplying `Level2Treasures` by `PointsPerTreasure`.\n   \n4. Sum the scores from both levels to get the `TotalScore`.\n\n5. Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and return the total score.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate Chloe's total score\ncalculate_score(Level1Treasures, Level2Treasures, PointsPerTreasure, TotalScore) :-\n    ScoreLevel1 is Level1Treasures * PointsPerTreasure,\n    ScoreLevel2 is Level2Treasures * PointsPerTreasure,\n    TotalScore is ScoreLevel1 + ScoreLevel2.\n\n% Query to find Chloe's total score\n% ?- calculate_score(6, 3, 9, TotalScore).\n% This should output Chloe's total score based on the given values.\n```\n\nBy defining the logical relationships and calculations in the Prolog code, we can accurately determine Chloe's total score in the video game by querying the `calculate_score` predicate with the appropriate values.",

The task is to calculate the total number of lives collectively held by all the players after the new players joined.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of lives, we need to consider the number of initial players and the number of additional players, along with the lives each player possesses. The analysis involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of lives for the initial 4 friends: 4 friends * 3 lives each = 12 lives.\n2. Calculate the total number of lives for the 5 new players: 5 players * 3 lives each = 15 lives.\n3. Sum up the lives of the initial players and the new players to find the total number of lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_total_lives\" that takes variables for the number of initial players, lives per player, number of new players, and lives per new player.\n2. Calculate the total lives for the initial players by multiplying the number of initial players with the lives per player.\n3. Calculate the total lives for the new players by multiplying the number of new players with the lives per new player.\n4. Sum up the total lives of the initial players and the new players to get the overall total lives.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n6.

Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group (5) and round up if necessary to determine the number of groups.\n4.

Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and return the result.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of initially cooked wings and additional wings cooked for the group\ninitial_wings(6).\nadditional_wings(3).\n\n% Calculate the total number of chicken wings available\ntotal_wings(TotalWings) :-\n    initial_wings(Initial),\n    additional_wings(Additional),\n    TotalWings is Initial + Additional.\n\n% Calculate the number of chicken wings each person would get\nwings_per_person(NumFriends, WingsPerPerson) :-\n    total_wings(TotalWings),\n    WingsPerPerson is TotalWings / NumFriends.\n```\n\nIn this Prolog code, we define the number of initially cooked wings and additional wings. We then calculate the total number of chicken wings available by summing these values. Finally, we calculate the number of chicken wings each person would get by dividing the total number of wings by the number of friends in the group. This structured approach allows us to efficiently determine the equal distribution of chicken wings among the friends using Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities.",

The chef initially had 8 chicken wings cooked.\n2. The chef cooked an additional 10 chicken wings for the group, making a total of 8 + 10 = 18 chicken wings.\n3. To divide the chicken wings equally among the 3 friends, we need to perform the division: 18 chicken wings / 3 friends = 6 chicken wings per person.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"divide_chicken_wings\" that calculates the number of chicken wings each person would receive.\n2. Assign constants for the initial number of chicken wings cooked and the additional chicken wings cooked.\n3. Calculate the total number of chicken wings available by summing the initial and additional chicken wings.\n4. Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends to determine how many each person would get.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n6. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the initial number of chicken wings and additional chicken wings\ninitial_chicken_wings(8).\nadditional_chicken_wings(10).\n\n% Calculate the number of chicken wings each person would get\ndivide_chicken_wings(NumFriends, WingsPerPerson) :-\n    initial_chicken_wings(InitialWings),\n    additional_chicken_wings(AdditionalWings),\n    TotalWings is InitialWings + AdditionalWings,\n    WingsPerPerson is TotalWings / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the initial and additional chicken wings, calculates the total number of chicken wings, and then determines how many chicken wings each person would receive by dividing the total number of wings by the number of friends.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a pet shelter initially has 2 puppies, and then an additional 34 puppies are brought in. The shelter aims to adopt out 4 puppies per day. The task is to determine how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, considering the initial number of puppies and the daily adoption rate.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of puppies in the shelter, the number of puppies adopted per day, and calculate the number of days required to adopt all the puppies. The analysis involves the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new arrivals.\n2. Determine the number of days required to adopt all the puppies based on the daily adoption rate.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo create a SWI-Prolog code for this task, we will define rules to calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter and the number of days needed to adopt all the puppies. Here's a structured plan to generate the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_puppies(Total)` that calculates the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new arrivals.\n2. Define a rule `days_to_adopt(TotalPuppies, DailyAdoptionRate, Days)` that calculates the number of days required to adopt all the puppies based on the total number of puppies and the daily adoption rate.\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values (initial puppies, new arrivals, adoption rate) and use them to compute the number of days needed for adoption.\n4. Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and determine the number of days required for adoption.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of puppies\ntotal_puppies(Total) :-\n    InitialPuppies = 2,\n    NewArrivals = 34,\n    Total is InitialPuppies + NewArrivals.\n\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of days needed to adopt all puppies\ndays_to_adopt(TotalPuppies, DailyAdoptionRate, Days) :-\n    Days is TotalPuppies / DailyAdoptionRate.\n\n% Query to find the number of days needed for adoption\n% ?- total_puppies(Total), days_to_adopt(Total, 4, Days).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we use Prolog rules to calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter and the number of days required to adopt all the puppies based on the daily adoption rate.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Adam purchased 13 boxes of chocolate candy, each containing 6 pieces. He then gave 7 boxes to his little brother. To determine how many pieces of chocolate candy Adam still has after giving some to his brother, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in the boxes he initially bought and subtract the pieces he gave away.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces in the 13 boxes of chocolate candy: 13 boxes * 6 pieces per box = 78 pieces.\n2. Determine the number of pieces Adam gave to his little brother: 7 boxes * 6 pieces per box = 42 pieces.\n3. Subtract the pieces given to his brother from the total pieces to find out how many pieces Adam still has: 78 pieces - 42 pieces = 36 pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of pieces Adam still has after giving some to his brother. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_remaining_pieces\" that takes variables for the total number of boxes, pieces per box, boxes given away, and calculates the remaining pieces.\n2. Calculate the total number of pieces in the initial boxes by multiplying the number of boxes by the pieces per box.\n3. Calculate the number of pieces given away by multiplying the boxes given away by the pieces per box.\n4. Calculate the remaining pieces by subtracting the pieces given away from the total pieces.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n6. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nHere's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the remaining pieces\ncalculate_remaining_pieces(TotalBoxes, PiecesPerBox, BoxesGivenAway, RemainingPieces) :-\n    TotalPieces is TotalBoxes * PiecesPerBox,\n    PiecesGivenAway is BoxesGivenAway * PiecesPerBox,\n    RemainingPieces is TotalPieces - PiecesGivenAway.\n\n% Query to find the remaining pieces after giving boxes to his brother\n% ?- calculate_remaining_pieces(13, 6, 7, RemainingPieces).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTo determine how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to consider the total number of problems on all the worksheets and the number of worksheets the teacher has already graded. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, the total number of problems on all 16 worksheets would be 16 * 4 = 64 problems. If the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, she has graded 8 * 4 = 32 problems. Therefore, the number of problems the teacher has left to grade can be calculated by subtracting the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Total number of problems on all worksheets = 16 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 64 problems.\n2. Number of problems already graded = 8 worksheets * 4 problems per worksheet = 32 problems.\n3.

Calculate the number of enemies defeated by subtracting the number of enemies not defeated (8) from the total number of enemies (11).\n3. Multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per defeated enemy (7) to determine the total points earned.\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and return the total points earned.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total points earned\ncalculate_points(EnemiesDefeated, PointsEarned) :-\n    TotalEnemies = 11,\n    EnemiesNotDefeated = 8,\n    EnemiesDefeated is TotalEnemies - EnemiesNotDefeated,\n    PointsEarned is EnemiesDefeated * 7.\n\n% Query to find the total points earned\nquery_points(PointsEarned) :-\n    calculate_points(_, PointsEarned).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem.

Initially, there are 46 books to be put away, but 10 books are taken by the librarian, leaving Oliver with the remaining books to organize on shelves. Given that Oliver can fit 4 books on a shelf, the task is to determine how many shelves he will need to accommodate the books he has.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many shelves Oliver will need, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of books Oliver has after the librarian takes 10 books.\n2. Determine the total number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of books by the number of books that can fit on each shelf (4 books per shelf).\n3.

Subtract the number of books taken by the librarian from the total number of books to get the number of books Oliver has.\n3.

The number of small gardens can be calculated by dividing the total number of seeds for small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of small gardens based on the given information. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_small_gardens` that takes the total number of seeds for small gardens and the number of seeds planted in each small garden as input.\n2. Calculate the total number of seeds for small gardens by subtracting the seeds planted in the big garden from the total seeds.\n3. Calculate the number of small gardens by dividing the total number of seeds for small gardens by the number of seeds planted in each small garden.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of small gardens\nnumber_of_small_gardens(TotalSeedsForSmallGardens, SeedsPerSmallGarden, NumSmallGardens) :-\n    TotalSeeds = 52,\n    SeedsInBigGarden = 28,\n    TotalSeedsForSmallGardens is TotalSeeds - SeedsInBigGarden,\n    NumSmallGardens is TotalSeedsForSmallGardens // SeedsPerSmallGarden.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to determine the number of small gardens Nancy had based on the given conditions. By querying this rule with the appropriate values, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of small gardens.",

Katie contributed 4 points to the total score, while the rest of the team members each scored 4 points. The task is to determine the number of players on Katie's team.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Katie scored 4 points, and the remaining team members each scored 4 points. Therefore, the total score of 12 points can be represented as:\n   - Katie's points (4) + (Number of players - 1) * Other players' points (4) = Total points (12).\n2. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   - 4 + 4 * (Number of players - 1) = 12.\n3. Solve the equation to find the number of players on Katie's team.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of players on Katie's team based on the given conditions. Here's how we can structure the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `team_players(KatiePoints, OtherPlayersPoints, TotalPoints, NumPlayers)` that calculates the number of players on Katie's team.\n2. Set up the equation based on the analysis to find the number of players.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve the equation and determine the number of players.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n1. Define a rule `team_players` that takes the points scored by Katie, other players, and the total points to calculate the number of players.\n2. Set up the equation based on the given conditions: `KatiePoints + (NumPlayers - 1) * OtherPlayersPoints = TotalPoints`.\n3. Solve the equation to find the value of `NumPlayers`.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nteam_players(KatiePoints, OtherPlayersPoints, TotalPoints, NumPlayers) :-\n    NumPlayers is (TotalPoints - KatiePoints) / OtherPlayersPoints + 1.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the number of players on Katie's team, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving calculations and constraints.",

Each pie requires a specific number of apples, and the total number of pies that can be made depends on the available apples and the apple requirement per pie.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Given Data**:\n   - Total apples in the cafeteria: 75\n   - Apples handed out to students: 19\n   - Apples required per pie: 8\n\n2. **Remaining Apples**:\n   - Calculate the number of apples remaining after handing out to students: Total apples - Apples handed out.\n\n3. **Number of Pies**:\n   - Determine the maximum number of pies that can be made using the remaining apples: Remaining apples / Apples per pie.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of pies that can be made based on the given data. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to determine the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `remaining_apples/3` to calculate the number of apples remaining after handing out to students.\n   - `pies_to_make/3` to calculate the number of pies that can be made using the remaining apples.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, utilizing the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the initial data (total apples, apples handed out, apples per pie) and check if the output matches the expected number of pies that can be made.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively determine the number of pies that can be made from the remaining apples in the cafeteria.",
