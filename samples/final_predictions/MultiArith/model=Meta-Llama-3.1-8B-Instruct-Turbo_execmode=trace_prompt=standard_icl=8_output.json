He has already received commitments from half the class and is working to persuade additional voters. The task involves calculating the total number of votes Alec has secured and determining how many additional votes he needs to reach his goal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Votes Required**: Alec needs three-quarters of the total class votes.\n   - Total class size = 60\n   - Required votes = 3/4 of 60 = 45 votes\n\n2. **Current Votes Secured**: Half of the class has already agreed to vote for Alec.\n   - Votes from half the class = 1/2 of 60 = 30 votes\n\n3. **Additional Votes from Undecided Students**: Out of the remaining students, only 5 were considering voting for him initially. After further campaigning, a fifth of the remaining students (who were not already considering him) decided to vote for him.\n   - Remaining students after 30 commitments = 60 - 30 = 30 students\n   - Initially undecided but considering = 5\n   - Remaining students not considering Alec initially = 30 - 5 = 25\n   - Additional votes after campaigning = 1/5 of 25 = 5 votes\n\n4. **Total Votes After Campaigning**: Sum of votes from committed and persuaded students.\n   - Total votes after initial and additional campaigning = 30 (initially committed) + 5 (initially undecided) + 5 (converted from non-considering) = 40 votes\n\n5. **Votes Needed to Reach Goal**: Subtract the total votes Alec has from the required votes.\n   - Additional votes needed = 45 (goal) - 40 (current) = 5 votes\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how many more votes Alec needs based on the input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_students/1` to hold the total number of students.\n   - `votes_required/2` to calculate the number of votes needed to win.\n   - `initial_votes/2` to calculate the votes Alec initially secured.\n   - `undecided_votes/2` to calculate the votes from students initially undecided.\n   - `additional_campaign_votes/3` to calculate the additional votes from non-considering students after campaigning.\n   - `total_current_votes/2` to sum up all votes Alec has after campaigning.\n   - `votes_needed/3` to calculate how many more votes Alec needs to reach his goal.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of students and check if the output matches the expected number of additional votes needed (5 votes).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values."

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on similar items.

Calculate Sara's total expenditure by adding the cost of the shoes and the dress.\n2. Double Sara's expenditure to determine Rachel's budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of Rachel's budget based on the expenses of Sara. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent)` which calculates the total amount spent by Sara. This rule will take the cost of the shoes and the dress as input and output the total spent.\n   \n2. Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget. This rule will take the total spent by Sara as input and output the budget for Rachel by doubling Sara's expenditure.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (ShoesCost as $50 and DressCost as $200) and use them to compute the desired budget for Rachel.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `RachelBudget` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define how much Sara spent\ntotal_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent) :-\n    TotalSpent is ShoesCost + DressCost.\n\n% Define Rachel's budget as twice what Sara spent\nbudget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget) :-\n    RachelBudget is 2 * SaraSpent.\n\n% Sample query to find Rachel's budget\n% ?- total_spent_by_sara(50, 200, SaraSpent), budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total spent by Sara and then calculates Rachel's budget based on Sara's expenditure. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given costs of the shoes and dress, outputting the amount Rachel should budget."

After accumulating his earnings for four weeks, he makes two sequential purchases: first, he spends half of his total savings on a video game, and then he spends a quarter of the remaining amount on a book. The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `dog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears)` that takes the brother's age in six years and computes the dog's age in six years.\n2. Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the age of Tom's dog in six years based on the given conditions."

The goal is to find out the difference in total costs between the two options after considering all these factors.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the first apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($800) and monthly utilities ($260).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost as the product of daily miles driven (31 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the first apartment.\n\n2. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the second apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($900) and monthly utilities ($200).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost using the daily miles driven (21 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the second apartment.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between the two total costs** to determine which apartment allows for greater monthly savings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate each part of the problem and then compare the results.\n\n1. **Define a predicate for calculating transportation cost**:\n   - Parameters: Miles per day, Cost per mile, Days per month.\n   - Returns: Total transportation cost.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for calculating total monthly cost**:\n   - Parameters: Rent, Utilities, Transportation cost.\n   - Returns: Total monthly cost.\n\n3. **Define a predicate to calculate the difference between the two total monthly costs**:\n   - Parameters: Total cost for the first apartment, Total cost for the second apartment.\n   - Returns: Difference in total costs.\n\n4. **Implement the predicates with actual values**:\n   - Use 800 for rent and 260 for utilities for the first apartment.\n   - Use 900 for rent and 200 for utilities for the second apartment.\n   - Use 31 miles and 21 miles for the daily transportation distances for the first and second apartments respectively.\n   - Use 58 cents as the cost per mile and 20 as the number of workdays per month.\n\n5. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference** to compute the results based on the given data.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code this way, we can efficiently compute the required values and compare the costs of the two apartments.

                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nJo-Bob's hot air balloon ride involves alternating periods of ascent and descent based on whether he pulls the lift chain or releases it. The balloon ascends at a rate of 50 feet per minute when the lift chain is pulled and descends at 10 feet per minute when the chain is not being pulled. He pulls the chain for two separate intervals of 15 minutes each and releases it for an interval of 10 minutes in between these periods. The task is to calculate the highest elevation reached during this ride.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the initial ascent: Jo-Bob pulls the chain for 15 minutes, causing the balloon to rise at 50 feet per minute.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n2. Calculate the descent after the first ascent: Jo-Bob releases the chain for 10 minutes, causing the balloon to descend at 10 feet per minute.\n   - Total descent = 10 minutes * 10 feet/minute = 100 feet.\n3. Calculate the second ascent: Jo-Bob again pulls the chain for 15 minutes at the same ascent rate.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n4. Calculate the highest elevation reached by adding the net gain after the first descent to the second ascent.\n   - Highest elevation = first ascent - first descent + second ascent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to model the balloon's behavior during ascent and descent and to calculate the highest elevation reached. The steps to construct the code are:\n\n1. Define predicates for ascent and descent that calculate the total change in height based on time and rate:\n   - `ascent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n   - `descent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n2. Define a predicate `balloon_ride` that calculates the highest elevation reached by using the ascent and descent predicates and considering the sequence of actions:\n   - `balloon_ride(HighestElevation) :- ascent(15, 50, Ascent1), descent(10, 10, Descent1), ascent(15, 50, Ascent2), HighestElevation is Ascent1 - Descent1 + Ascent2.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the highest elevation:\n   - `?- balloon_ride(HighestElevation).`\n4. The code will use logical inference to determine the total heights for each ascent and descent phase and combine these to find the highest elevation reached.\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to model and solve the problem based on the given conditions of the balloon's ascent and descent rates and the times Jo-Bob pulls or releases the chain."

The blue weights each weigh 2 pounds, and the green weights each weigh 3 pounds. He uses 4 blue weights and 5 green weights. Additionally, the bar itself has a weight of 2 pounds. To find the total weight of the bar with the weights, we need to calculate the weight contributed by each color of weight and add it to the bar's weight.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by calculating the total weight for each type of weight and then adding these weights together along with the bar's weight:\n1. Calculate the total weight of the blue weights: Number of blue weights multiplied by the weight of each blue weight.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the green weights: Number of green weights multiplied by the weight of each green weight.\n3. Add the weights of the blue and green weights to the weight of the bar to get the total weight.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total weight based on the given input of the number of each type of weight and the weight of the bar. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_weight` that takes five parameters: the number of blue weights (`NumBlue`), the number of green weights (`NumGreen`), the weight of each blue weight (`WeightBlue`), the weight of each green weight (`WeightGreen`), and the weight of the bar (`WeightBar`).\n2. Calculate the total weight contributed by the blue weights as `NumBlue * WeightBlue`.\n3. Calculate the total weight contributed by the green weights as `NumGreen * WeightGreen`.\n4. Sum the weights from the blue weights, green weights, and the bar to get the `TotalWeight`.\n5. Use swi-prolog's ability to perform arithmetic operations and unify the result with `TotalWeight`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total weight\ntotal_weight(NumBlue, NumGreen, WeightBlue, WeightGreen, WeightBar, TotalWeight) :-\n    TotalBlueWeight is NumBlue * WeightBlue,\n    TotalGreenWeight is NumGreen * WeightGreen,\n    TotalWeight is TotalBlueWeight + TotalGreenWeight + WeightBar.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total weight\n% ?- total_weight(4, 5, 2, 3, 2, TotalWeight).\n% This should output the total weight with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total weight of Harry's custom weight bar setup using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing the power of Prolog in handling mathematical tasks through logical rules."

Each video game costs $45, and each book costs $5. By the end of the summer, Kenny has mowed 35 lawns and wants to buy 5 video games. We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently."

        "question": "The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe school cafeteria ordered a certain number of red and green apples for the students' lunches. However, only 9 students wanted fruit, which means the cafeteria had more apples than they needed. We need to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria.\n2. Calculate the number of apples that were actually used by the students.\n3. Subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples ordered to find the number of extra apples.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of extra apples. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_apples(Red, Green, Total)` that takes the number of red and green apples as input and returns the total number of apples.\n2. Define a predicate `apples_used(Students, Used)` that takes the number of students who wanted fruit as input and returns the number of apples used.\n3. Define a predicate `extra_apples(Total, Used, Extra)` that takes the total number of apples and the number of apples used as input and returns the number of extra apples.\n4. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve for the number of extra apples.\n\nHere's a sample swi-prolog code that implements this plan:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_apples(Red, Green, Total) :- Total is Red + Green.\napples_used(Students, Used) :- Used is Students.\nextra_apples(Total, Used, Extra) :- Extra is Total - Used.\n\ncafeteria_apples(Red, Green, Students, Extra) :-\n    total_apples(Red, Green, Total),\n    apples_used(Students, Used),\n    extra_apples(Total, Used, Extra).\n```\n\nIn this code, we define three predicates: `total_apples`, `apples_used`, and `extra_apples`. We then define a fourth predicate `cafeteria_apples` that takes the number of red and green apples, the number of students who wanted fruit, and the number of extra apples as input. This predicate uses the other three predicates to calculate the number of extra apples.\n\nTo find the number of extra apples, we can query the `cafeteria_apples` predicate with the given values:\n\n```prolog\n?- cafeteria_apples(42, 7, 9, Extra).\n```\n\nThis will output the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.",

Subtract the number of deleted files from the initial total to find the remaining number of files.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining number of files based on the given input of the initial number of music and video files, and the total number of deleted files. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_files(Music, Video, Total)` that takes the number of music files and video files as input and returns the initial total number of files.\n2. Define a predicate `deleted_files(Deleted)` that takes the total number of deleted files as input.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_files(Total, Deleted, Remaining)` that takes the initial total number of files and the total number of deleted files as input and returns the remaining number of files.\n4. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the remaining number of files by subtracting the number of deleted files from the initial total.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_files(Music, Video, Total) :- Total is Music + Video.\ndeleted_files(Deleted) :- Deleted = 23.\nremaining_files(Total, Deleted, Remaining) :- Remaining is Total - Deleted.\n\namy_files(Music, Video, Deleted) :-\n    initial_files(Music, Video, Total),\n    deleted_files(Deleted),\n    remaining_files(Total, Deleted, Remaining).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and uses arithmetic operations to calculate the remaining number of files. By setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates, we can use swi-prolog's search capabilities to find the solution to the problem.",

He initially buys 11 games from his friend and 22 more at the garage sale. However, 19 of the games he bought don't work, leaving him with a certain number of good games. We need to calculate the total number of good games Ned has after discarding the non-working ones.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of games Ned bought by adding the number of games from his friend and the garage sale: 11 games + 22 games.\n2. Subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games to find the number of good games: Total games - Non-working games.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of good games based on the given input of the number of games bought and the number of non-working games.

Define a predicate `good_games(Total, NonWorking, Good)` where `Good` is the number of good games after discarding the non-working ones.\n3. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve for the number of good games by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_games(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtAtGarageSale, Total) :-\n    Total is BoughtFromFriend + BoughtAtGarageSale.\n\ngood_games(Total, NonWorking, Good) :-\n    Good is Total - NonWorking.\n\nned_games(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtAtGarageSale, NonWorking, Good) :-\n    total_games(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtAtGarageSale, Total),\n    good_games(Total, NonWorking, Good).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use arithmetic operations to calculate the total number of games and the number of good games.

They each picked a certain number of carrots, and after counting them, they found that only 64 of the carrots were good.

We need to find out how many bad carrots they had.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of carrots picked by Vanessa and her mom: 17 (Vanessa's carrots) + 14 (mom's carrots) = 31 carrots.\n2. Since only 24 carrots were good, we can find the number of bad carrots by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots: 31 (total carrots) - 24 (good carrots) = 7 bad carrots.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of bad carrots based on the given information. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1.

        "question": "Debby bought two coloring books. One had 16 pictures and the other had 40. After one week she had already colored 33 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDebby has two coloring books with different numbers of pictures. She has already colored 33 pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we need to calculate the total number of pictures in both books and subtract the number of pictures she has already colored.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures in both coloring books:\n   - Book 1 has 16 pictures.\n   - Book 2 has 40 pictures.\n   - Total pictures = 16 + 40 = 56\n\n2. Subtract the number of pictures Debby has already colored from the total number of pictures:\n   - Pictures left to color = Total pictures - Pictures colored\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"total_pictures\" that takes variables for the number of pictures in each book and calculates the total number of pictures.\n2. Define a rule \"pictures_left\" that takes the total number of pictures and the number of pictures colored, and calculates the number of pictures left to color.\n3. Assign constants to the number of pictures in each book (16 and 40).\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations.\n5. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nHere's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of pictures in each book\nbook1_pictures(16).\nbook2_pictures(40).\n\n% Calculate the total number of pictures\ntotal_pictures(Book1, Book2, Total) :-\n    book1_pictures(Book1),\n    book2_pictures(Book2),\n    Total is Book1 + Book2.\n\n% Calculate the number of pictures left to color\npictures_left(Total, Colored, Left) :-\n    Left is Total - Colored.\n\n% Calculate the number of pictures left to color\ncalculate_left(Left) :-\n    total_pictures(16, 40, Total),\n    pictures_left(Total, 33, Left).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the number of pictures in each book, calculates the total number of pictures, and then calculates the number of pictures left to color by subtracting the number of pictures already colored from the total.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nAmy baked a total of pastries for the school bake sale. She had 15 cupcakes and 48 cookies, making a total of 63 pastries. After the sale, she had 12 pastries left to take back home. To find out how many pastries she sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she baked.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pastries Amy baked: 15 cupcakes + 48 cookies = 63 pastries.\n2. Calculate the number of pastries Amy sold by subtracting the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she baked: 63 pastries - 12 pastries = 51 pastries.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_pastries_sold\" that takes variables for the total number of pastries baked and the number of pastries taken back home.\n2. Assign constants to the number of cupcakes and cookies baked.\n3. Compute the total number of pastries baked by adding the number of cupcakes and cookies.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNancy and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. They both picked a certain number of carrots, but only a portion of them were good. We know that Nancy picked 38 carrots and her mom picked 47 carrots. Together, they picked a total of 38 + 47 = 85 carrots. However, only 71 of these carrots were good. To find out how many bad carrots they had, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of carrots picked by Nancy and her mom.\n2. Calculate the number of good carrots.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, given the initial number of students, the number of students who left, and the number of new students who joined.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Students**: There were 33 students at the start of the year.\n2. **Students Who Left**: 18 students left during the year.\n3. **New Students Who Joined**: 14 new students came to school.\n4. **Net Change in Student Count**: To find the net change, subtract the number of students who left from the number of new students who joined.\n   - Net change = 14 (new students) - 18 (students who left) = -4\n5. **Final Number of Students**: Subtract the net change from the initial number of students to find the final number of students.\n   - Final number of students = 33 (initial) - 4 (net change) = 29\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final number of students based on the input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_students/1` to hold the initial number of students.\n   - `students_left/1` to hold the number of students who left.\n   - `new_students/1` to hold the number of new students who joined.\n   - `net_change/2` to calculate the net change in student count.\n   - `final_students/2` to calculate the final number of students.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the initial number of students, the number of students who left, and the number of new students who joined, and check if the output matches the expected final number of students (29).\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code that implements this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the initial number of students\ninitial_students(33).\n\n% Define the number of students who left\nstudents_left(18).\n\n% Define the number of new students who joined\nnew_students(14).\n\n% Calculate the net change in student count\nnet_change(NewStudents, StudentsLeft) :-\n    NewStudents is 14,\n    StudentsLeft is 18.\n\n% Calculate the final number of students\nfinal_students(Initial, Final) :-\n    Initial is 33,\n    NetChange is -4,\n    Final is Initial + NetChange.\n\n% Test the implementation\n?- initial_students(Initial), students_left(StudentsLeft), new_students(NewStudents), net_change(NewStudents, StudentsLeft), final_students(Initial, Final).\n```\n\nThis code defines the initial number of students, the number of students who left, and the number of new students who joined. It then calculates the net change in student count and uses this to determine the final number of students. The final answer is obtained by querying the `final_students/2` predicate with the initial number of students.",

Then, 3 books are sold, leaving a certain number of books in the bin. After that, 10 more books are added to the bin. We need to calculate the total number of books in the bin after these events.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Books**: There are 4 books in the bin initially.\n2. **Books Sold**: 3 books are sold, leaving 4 - 3 = 1 book in the bin.\n3. **Additional Books Added**: 10 more books are added to the bin, making the total number of books 1 + 10 = 11.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of books in the bin after the events. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a predicate `total_books/2`** that takes two parameters: the initial number of books and the number of books added.\n2. **Calculate the number of books left after selling 3 books**: Subtract 3 from the initial number of books.\n3. **Add the additional books to the remaining books**: Add the number of books added to the remaining books.\n4. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities** to perform the calculations and unify the result with the total number of books.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the total number of books\ntotal_books(InitialBooks, AdditionalBooks, TotalBooks) :-\n    RemainingBooks is InitialBooks - 3,\n    TotalBooks is RemainingBooks + AdditionalBooks.\n\n% Example query to find the total number of books\n% ?- total_books(4, 10, TotalBooks).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule to calculate the total number of books in the bin after selling 3 books and adding 10 more.

Initially, there are 40 oranges in the bin. Then, 37 old oranges are removed, and 7 new oranges are added. We need to determine the total number of oranges in the bin after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of oranges left after throwing away 37 old ones: 40 - 37 = 3.\n2. Add the 7 new oranges to the remaining oranges: 3 + 7 = 10.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of oranges in the bin after the changes. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_oranges` that takes the initial number of oranges, the number of old oranges thrown away, and the number of new oranges added as parameters.\n2. Calculate the number of oranges left after throwing away the old ones using subtraction.\n3. Add the new oranges to the remaining oranges to get the total number of oranges.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total oranges\ntotal_oranges(InitialOranges, OldOranges, NewOranges, TotalOranges) :-\n    RemainingOranges is InitialOranges - OldOranges,\n    TotalOranges is RemainingOranges + NewOranges.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total number of oranges\n% ?- total_oranges(40, 37, 7, TotalOranges).\n% This should output the total number of oranges.\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationship between the initial number of oranges, the number of old ones thrown away, the number of new ones added, and the total number of oranges. By querying the `total_oranges` predicate with the given values, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the total number of oranges in the bin.",

Add the 32 roses she picked to the number of roses she had after selling 2 of them to get the total number of roses.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of roses based on the given input of the initial number of roses, the number of roses sold, and the number of roses picked. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_roses` that takes three parameters: the initial number of roses (`InitialRoses`), the number of roses sold (`RosesSold`), and the number of roses picked (`RosesPicked`).\n2. Calculate the number of roses the florist had after selling 2 of them as `InitialRoses - RosesSold`.\n3. Add the 32 roses she picked to the number of roses she had after selling 2 of them to get the `TotalRoses`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's ability to perform arithmetic operations and unify the result with `TotalRoses`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total roses\ntotal_roses(InitialRoses, RosesSold, RosesPicked, TotalRoses) :-\n    RosesAfterSale is InitialRoses - RosesSold,\n    TotalRoses is RosesAfterSale + RosesPicked.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total number of roses\n% ?- total_roses(11, 2, 32, TotalRoses).\n% This should output the total number of roses with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total number of roses the florist has by following the logical steps outlined in the analysis, showcasing the power of Prolog in handling mathematical tasks through logical rules.",

        "question": "At the town carnival Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times. If each ride cost 5 tickets, how many tickets did he use?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBilly rode the ferris wheel 7 times and the bumper cars 3 times at the town carnival. Each ride costs 5 tickets. To find out how many tickets Billy used, we need to calculate the total number of rides he took and then multiply that by the number of tickets each ride costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of rides Billy took by adding the number of times he rode the ferris wheel and the bumper cars.\n2. Multiply the total number of rides by the number of tickets each ride costs to find the total number of tickets used.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total number of tickets used based on the given information. Prolog's arithmetic capabilities will be used to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nThe blueprint to create a SWI-Prolog code for this scenario is as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_tickets` that takes variables for the number of rides on the ferris wheel and the bumper cars, and the number of tickets each ride costs.\n2. Calculate the total number of rides by adding the number of rides on the ferris wheel and the bumper cars.\n3. Multiply the total number of rides by the number of tickets each ride costs to find the total number of tickets used.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate total tickets\ntotal_tickets(FerrisWheelRides, BumperCarsRides, TicketsPerRide, TotalTickets) :-\n    TotalRides is FerrisWheelRides + BumperCarsRides,\n    TotalTickets is TotalRides * TicketsPerRide.\n\n% Example query to calculate total tickets\n% ?- total_tickets(7, 3, 5, TotalTickets).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses logical inference and arithmetic calculations to solve the problem, providing a clear and concise solution.",

        "question": "Olivia was playing a video game where she scores 8 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 2 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nOlivia is playing a video game where she scores 8 points for each treasure she finds. She has found treasures on two levels: the first level and the second level. We need to calculate her total score by multiplying the number of treasures found on each level by the score per treasure and then summing up these values.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the score for the first level by multiplying the number of treasures found (2) by the score per treasure (8).\n   - Score for the first level = 2 * 8 = 16 points\n2. Calculate the score for the second level by multiplying the number of treasures found (2) by the score per treasure (8).\n   - Score for the second level = 2 * 8 = 16 points\n3. Sum up the scores for both levels to get the total score.\n   - Total score = Score for the first level + Score for the second level = 16 + 16 = 32 points\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total score based on the number of treasures found on each level and the score per treasure. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_score(Treasures, ScorePerTreasure, TotalScore)` that takes the number of treasures found and the score per treasure as input and returns the total score.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the score for each level by multiplying the number of treasures found by the score per treasure.\n3. Sum up the scores for both levels to get the total score.\n4.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves determining the total number of customers a waiter has, given that he is serving 6 tables with a specific number of women and men at each table. To find the total number of customers, we need to calculate the number of customers at each table and then sum up these values.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Number of Customers per Table**: Each table has 3 women and 5 men, making a total of 8 customers per table.\n2. **Total Tables**: The waiter is serving 6 tables.\n3. **Total Customers**: Multiply the number of customers per table by the total number of tables to find the total number of customers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of customers based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `customers_per_table/1` to hold the number of customers at each table.\n   - `total_tables/1` to hold the total number of tables.\n   - `total_customers/2` to calculate the total number of customers.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts to define the number of customers per table and the total number of tables.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the `total_customers/2` predicate to calculate the total number of customers.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of tables and check if the output matches the expected total number of customers.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\ncustomers_per_table(8).\ntotal_tables(6).\n\ntotal_customers(TotalTables, TotalCustomers) :-\n    customers_per_table(CustomersPerTable),\n    total_tables(TotalTables),\n    TotalCustomers is CustomersPerTable * TotalTables.\n\n?- total_customers(6, TotalCustomers).\n```\n\nThis code defines the number of customers per table and the total number of tables as facts.

        "question": "Tiffany had 6 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. If each page had 3 problems on it, how many problems did she have to complete total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nTiffany has two types of homework: math and reading. Each type of homework has a certain number of pages, and each page has a specific number of problems. The task is to calculate the total number of problems Tiffany has to complete.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of problems, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pages for each type of homework:\n   - Math homework: 6 pages\n   - Reading homework: 4 pages\n\n2. Calculate the total number of problems for each type of homework by multiplying the number of pages by the number of problems per page:\n   - Math problems: 6 pages * 3 problems/page = 18 problems\n   - Reading problems: 4 pages * 3 problems/page = 12 problems\n\n3. Sum up the total number of problems for both types of homework to get the overall total:\n   - Total problems = Math problems + Reading problems = 18 + 12 = 30 problems\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of problems based on the given input of the number of pages for each type of homework and the number of problems per page. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_problems` that takes variables for the number of pages of math and reading homework and the number of problems per page.\n2. Assign constants to the number of pages for each type of homework (e.g., math_pages, reading_pages).\n3. Assign a constant to the number of problems per page (e.g., problems_per_page).\n4. Compute the total number of problems for each type of homework by multiplying the number of pages by the number of problems per page.\n5. Sum up the total number of problems for both types of homework to get the overall total.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints.

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_rides/2` to calculate the total number of rides.\n   - `tickets_per_ride/1` to hold the number of tickets per ride.\n   - `total_tickets_used/2` to calculate the total tickets used.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the number of ferris wheel rides and bumper car rides, and check if the output matches the expected total tickets used (30 tickets).\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that would represent this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total tickets used\ntotal_tickets_used(FerrisWheelRides, BumperCarsRides, TotalTickets) :-\n    TotalRides is FerrisWheelRides + BumperCarsRides,\n    TicketsPerRide = 3,\n    TotalTickets is TotalRides * TicketsPerRide.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total tickets used\n% ?- total_tickets_used(7, 3, TotalTickets).\n% This should output the total tickets used with the given numbers.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total tickets used by Oliver based on the given number of rides and tickets per ride, showcasing the power of Prolog in handling arithmetic tasks through logical rules.",

To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Number of Players**: The total number of players is the sum of new and returning players.\n   - Total players = 48 (new) + 6 (returning) = 54 players\n2. **Number of Players per Group**: Each group consists of 6 players.\n3. **Number of Groups**: Divide the total number of players by the number of players per group to find the number of groups.\n   - Number of groups = Total players / Players per group = 54 / 6\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of groups based on the given input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_players/2` to hold the total number of players.\n   - `players_per_group/1` to hold the number of players in each group.\n   - `number_of_groups/2` to calculate the number of groups.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of players and the number of players per group, and check if the output matches the expected number of groups.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of players\ntotal_players(54).\n\n% Define the number of players per group\nplayers_per_group(6).\n\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of groups\nnumber_of_groups(TotalPlayers, PlayersPerGroup, NumberOfGroups) :-\n    TotalPlayers =:= PlayersPerGroup * NumberOfGroups.\n\n% Test the rule\n?- number_of_groups(54, 6, NumberOfGroups).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the total number of players, the number of players per group, and a rule to calculate the number of groups.

Initially, there are 9 puppies, and 12 more are brought in, making a total of 21 puppies. The shelter adopts 3 puppies per day. We need to find out how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of days required to adopt all the puppies. We can do this by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of puppies: 9 (initial puppies) + 12 (new puppies) = 21 puppies.\n2. Calculate the number of days required to adopt all puppies: Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day = 21 / 3 = 7 days.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule to calculate the number of days required to adopt all puppies.

Here's the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `shelves_needed(TotalBears, BearsPerShelf, ShelvesNeeded)` that takes the total number of bears and the number of bears per shelf as input and returns the number of shelves needed.\n2. Calculate the total number of bears by adding the initial number of bears and the number of new bears.\n3. Use the total number of bears and the number of bears per shelf to calculate the number of shelves needed.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of shelves needed\nshelves_needed(TotalBears, BearsPerShelf, ShelvesNeeded) :-\n    TotalBears is 6 + 18, % Calculate the total number of bears\n    ShelvesNeeded is TotalBears // BearsPerShelf.\n\n% Query to find the number of shelves needed\nquery_shelves_needed(ShelvesNeeded) :-\n    shelves_needed(24, 6, ShelvesNeeded).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_shelves_needed(ShelvesNeeded)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of shelves needed to display the bears.",

The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_trays/2` to hold the total number of trays to pick up.\n   - `trays_per_trip/1` to hold the number of trays Jerry can carry in each trip.\n   - `total_trips/2` to calculate the total number of trips.\n   - `remaining_trays/2` to calculate the number of remaining trays.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of trays and the number of trays per trip, and check if the output matches the expected number of trips (2).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values.",

        "question": "Paul made 3 dollars mowing lawns and 3 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nPaul earns money from two activities: mowing lawns and weed eating. He earns $3 from each activity, making his total earnings $6. However, he spends $3 per week. To find out how long his money will last, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for him to spend all his earnings.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n1. Calculate Paul's total earnings from mowing lawns and weed eating: $3 (mowing) + $3 (weed eating) = $6.\n2. Since Paul spends $3 per week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for him to spend his total earnings: Total earnings / Weekly expenditure.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of weeks Paul's money will last based on his total earnings and weekly expenditure. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule \"weeks_money_last\" that takes variables for total_earnings and weekly_expenditure.\n2. Calculate the number of weeks by dividing total_earnings by weekly_expenditure.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the total points scored by a trivia team. Initially, the team had 15 members, but 6 members didn't show up for the game. We need to find out how many points were scored in total by the members who did show up.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the number of members who showed up for the game by subtracting the number of members who didn't show up from the total number of members: 15 - 6 = 9 members.\n2. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the points scored by each member: 9 members * 3 points/member.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule to calculate the total points scored by the team. The plan involves defining a predicate that takes the total number of members and the number of members who didn't show up as input, and returns the total points scored.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_points(TotalMembers, NoShowMembers, Points)` where `TotalMembers` is the total number of members, `NoShowMembers` is the number of members who didn't show up, and `Points` is the total points scored.\n2. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the number of members who showed up by subtracting `NoShowMembers` from `TotalMembers`.\n3. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of members who showed up by the points scored by each member (3 points).\n4.

Calculate the amount of money Roger actually earned by subtracting the number of lawns he forgot to mow from the total number of lawns and multiplying the result by the amount he earns per lawn: (14 - 8) lawns * $9/lawn.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule to calculate the amount of money Roger actually earned. The plan will involve defining a rule that takes the total number of lawns and the number of lawns forgotten as input and returns the actual earnings.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(TotalLawns, Earnings)` where `TotalLawns` is the total number of lawns and `Earnings` is the total amount of money earned.\n2. Define a predicate `actual_earnings(TotalLawns, ForgottenLawns, ActualEarnings)` where `ActualEarnings` is the amount of money actually earned.\n3. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve for the actual earnings by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(TotalLawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is TotalLawns * 9.\nactual_earnings(TotalLawns, ForgottenLawns, ActualEarnings) :-\n    ActualLawns is TotalLawns - ForgottenLawns,\n    ActualEarnings is ActualLawns * 9.\n\nroger_earnings(TotalLawns, ForgottenLawns, ActualEarnings) :-\n    total_earnings(TotalLawns, TotalEarnings),\n    actual_earnings(TotalLawns, ForgottenLawns, ActualEarnings).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use arithmetic operations to calculate the actual earnings.

Since the painter will paint the remaining 4 rooms at the same rate, we can divide the remaining time by 4 to find out how much longer it will take to paint the rest.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the time it will take to paint the remaining rooms. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total time, subtracts the time already spent, and then computes how much longer it will take to paint the remaining rooms.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_time(Rooms, Hours)` where `Rooms` is the number of rooms and `Hours` is the total time it would take to paint all rooms.\n2. Define a predicate `time_spent(Rooms, Hours)` where `Rooms` is the number of rooms already painted and `Hours` is the time it took to paint those rooms.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_time(Hours, Rooms)` where `Hours` is the remaining time and `Rooms` is the number of rooms left to paint.\n4. Define a predicate `time_to_paint_remaining(Rooms, Hours)` where `Hours` is the time it will take to paint the remaining rooms.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the time it will take to paint the remaining rooms by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_time(Rooms, Hours) :- Hours is Rooms * 8.\ntime_spent(Rooms, Hours) :- Hours is Rooms * 8.\nremaining_time(Hours, Rooms) :- RemainingHours is Hours - 5 * 8, RemainingRooms is 9 - 5.\ntime_to_paint_remaining(Rooms, Hours) :- Hours is RemainingHours / RemainingRooms.\n\nkenny_time(9, 8, 5, Time) :-\n    total_time(9, TotalHours),\n    time_spent(5, SpentHours),\n    remaining_time(TotalHours - SpentHours, 4),\n    time_to_paint_remaining(4, Time).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use arithmetic operations to calculate the time it will take to paint the remaining rooms. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently.",

Calculate the time it will take to cook each of the remaining potatoes: 3 minutes per potato.\n3. Multiply the number of potatoes that still need to be cooked by the time it takes to cook each one to get the total cooking time.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of the total cooking time. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_time_to_cook(Potatoes, Time)` that calculates the total time it will take to cook a given number of potatoes. This predicate will take the number of potatoes as input and output the total time in minutes.\n2. Use the predicate to calculate the total time it will take to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute the total time.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the time it takes to cook one potato\ntime_to_cook_one_potato(3).\n\n% Define the total time to cook a given number of potatoes\ntotal_time_to_cook(Potatoes, Time) :-\n    time_to_cook_one_potato(3),\n    Time is Potatoes * 3.\n\n% Sample query to find the total time to cook the remaining potatoes\n% ?- total_time_to_cook(2, Time).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total time it will take to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.

Calculate the number of members who showed up for the game by subtracting the number of members who did not show up from the total number of members.\n2. Multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored to get the total number of points scored.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of the total points scored by the team. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_points_scored(TotalMembers, NoShowMembers, PointsScored)` that calculates the total number of points scored by the team. This predicate will take the total number of members, the number of members who did not show up, and the points scored by each member as input and output the total points scored.\n   \n2. Use arithmetic operations to calculate the number of members who showed up and the total points scored.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (TotalMembers as 7, NoShowMembers as 2, and PointsScored as 4) and use them to compute the desired total points scored.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `PointsScored` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total points scored\ntotal_points_scored(TotalMembers, NoShowMembers, PointsScored, PointsScored) :-\n    MembersWhoShowedUp is TotalMembers - NoShowMembers,\n    PointsScored is MembersWhoShowedUp * 4.\n\n% Sample query to find the total points scored\n% ?- total_points_scored(7, 2, PointsScored).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the number of members who showed up and the total points scored by the team. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given values, outputting the total points scored.",

The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_tickets/1` to hold the initial number of tickets Adam bought.\n   - `tickets_left/1` to hold the number of tickets Adam had left after riding the ferris wheel.\n   - `tickets_used/2` to calculate the number of tickets used to ride the ferris wheel.\n   - `cost_per_ticket/1` to hold the cost of each ticket.\n   - `total_amount_spent/2` to calculate the total amount spent riding the ferris wheel.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the initial number of tickets and the cost per ticket, and check if the output matches the expected total amount spent (63 dollars).\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_tickets(10).\ntickets_left(3).\ncost_per_ticket(9).\n\ntickets_used(InitialTickets, TicketsLeft, UsedTickets) :-\n    UsedTickets is InitialTickets - TicketsLeft.\n\ntotal_amount_spent(InitialTickets, CostPerTicket, TicketsLeft, TotalAmount) :-\n    tickets_used(InitialTickets, TicketsLeft, UsedTickets),\n    TotalAmount is UsedTickets * CostPerTicket.\n\n% Test the implementation\n?- total_amount_spent(10, 9, 3, TotalAmount).\n```\n\nThis code defines the necessary predicates and uses them to calculate the total amount spent riding the ferris wheel.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe pet store initially had 18 puppies. After selling 3 of them, they were left with 18 - 3 = 15 puppies. These puppies were then placed into cages, with 5 puppies in each cage. We need to find out how many cages were used to accommodate the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of puppies left after selling 3 of them.\n2. Determine the number of cages needed to accommodate the remaining puppies, with 5 puppies in each cage.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of cages needed based on the number of puppies left and the capacity of each cage.

The test query at the end demonstrates how to use the predicate to find the number of cages needed for 18 puppies with a capacity of 5 puppies per cage.",

Calculate the number of puppies left after selling 28 of them: `Puppies Left = Initial Puppies - Puppies Sold = 64 - 28 = 36`.\n2.

Calculate the number of books Mike has left after the librarian takes 10 books.\n   - Remaining books = Total books - Books taken by librarian = 82 - 10 = 72 books\n\n2. Determine how many shelves Mike will need to put away the remaining books.\n   - Since each shelf can hold 9 books, we need to divide the number of remaining books by 9 to find the number of shelves needed.\n   - Number of shelves = Remaining books / Books per shelf = 72 / 9\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of shelves Mike will need based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `shelves_needed(TotalBooks, BooksTaken, BooksPerShelf, ShelvesNeeded)` that takes the total number of books, the number of books taken by the librarian, and the number of books each shelf can hold as input.\n2. Calculate the remaining books by subtracting the books taken by the librarian from the total number of books.\n3. Calculate the number of shelves needed by dividing the remaining books by the number of books each shelf can hold.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and logical inference to ensure the correct flow of data.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\nshelves_needed(TotalBooks, BooksTaken, BooksPerShelf, ShelvesNeeded) :-\n    RemainingBooks is TotalBooks - BooksTaken,\n    ShelvesNeeded is RemainingBooks // BooksPerShelf.\n\n% Query to find the number of shelves needed\n% ?- shelves_needed(82, 10, 9, ShelvesNeeded).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying the `shelves_needed/4` predicate, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of shelves Mike will need to put away the remaining books.",

Here's how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_students/1` to hold the total number of students.\n   - `students_not_selected/1` to hold the number of students not selected.\n   - `students_selected/2` to calculate the number of students selected.\n   - `number_of_groups/1` to hold the number of groups.\n   - `students_per_group/2` to calculate the number of students in each group.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of students and the number of students not selected, and check if the output matches the expected number of students per group (7).\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_students(64).\nstudents_not_selected(36).\nstudents_selected(Total, Selected) :- Total is 64, Selected is 64 - 36.\nnumber_of_groups(4).\nstudents_per_group(Total, GroupSize) :- students_selected(Total, _), number_of_groups(4), GroupSize is Total / 4.\n\nquery_students_per_group(GroupSize) :-\n    students_per_group(28, GroupSize).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_students_per_group(GroupSize)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of students in each group based on the given conditions.",

We need to determine the number of tables the waiter had.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Customers**: The waiter initially had 21 customers.\n2. **Customers Left**: 12 customers left, leaving 21 - 12 = 9 customers.\n3. **Customers per Table**: Each table has 3 people.\n4. **Number of Tables**: To find the number of tables, we need to divide the remaining customers by the number of customers per table: 9 / 3 = 3 tables.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of tables based on the given information. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_customers/1` to hold the initial number of customers.\n   - `customers_left/2` to calculate the number of customers left after some left.\n   - `customers_per_table/1` to hold the number of customers per table.\n   - `number_of_tables/2` to calculate the number of tables based on the remaining customers and customers per table.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the initial number of customers and check if the output matches the expected number of tables (3 tables).\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_customers(21).\ncustomers_left(Initial, Remaining) :- Initial is 21, Remaining is Initial - 12.\ncustomers_per_table(3).\nnumber_of_tables(Remaining, Tables) :- Remaining is 9, Tables is Remaining / 3.\n\nquery_tables(Tables) :-\n    customers_left(Initial, Remaining),\n    customers_per_table(CustomersPerTable),\n    number_of_tables(Remaining, Tables).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_tables(Tables)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the number of tables the waiter had.",

Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the number of problems on each page by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicate.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code that implements this plan:\n\n```prolog\nproblems_per_page(TotalProblems, CompletedProblems, Pages, ProblemsPerPage) :-\n    RemainingProblems is TotalProblems - CompletedProblems,\n    ProblemsPerPage is RemainingProblems // Pages.\n\nkenny_books(TotalProblems, CompletedProblems, Pages, ProblemsPerPage) :-\n    TotalProblems = 60,\n    CompletedProblems = 20,\n    Pages = 5,\n    problems_per_page(TotalProblems, CompletedProblems, Pages, ProblemsPerPage).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of problems on each page, ensuring that only whole numbers of problems can be on each page. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently.",

The tables they had held 2 people each, so we need to determine how many tables were needed to accommodate the 10 attendees.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many tables were needed, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Determine how many rides Tom can go on with the remaining 12 tickets by dividing the number of tickets by the cost per ride: `12 / 4 = 3` rides.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of rides Tom can go on based on the number of tickets he has left and the cost per ride. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `tickets_left(TotalTickets, SpentTickets, RemainingTickets)` that calculates the number of tickets Tom has left after spending a certain number of tickets.\n2. Define a predicate `rides_purchasable(RemainingTickets, CostPerRide, Rides)` that determines how many rides Tom can go on with the remaining tickets.\n3. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve for the number of rides by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n4. Query the `rides_purchasable` predicate with the correct values to find the number of rides Tom can go on.\n\nHere's a sample swi-prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\ntickets_left(TotalTickets, SpentTickets, RemainingTickets) :-\n    RemainingTickets is TotalTickets - SpentTickets.\n\nrides_purchasable(RemainingTickets, CostPerRide, Rides) :-\n    Rides is RemainingTickets // CostPerRide.\n\ntom_rides(TotalTickets, SpentTickets, CostPerRide, Rides) :-\n    tickets_left(TotalTickets, SpentTickets, RemainingTickets),\n    rides_purchasable(RemainingTickets, CostPerRide, Rides).\n\n% Query to find the number of rides Tom can go on\n% ?- tom_rides(40, 28, 4, Rides).\n```\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to solve the problem by defining the relationships between the variables and using the `//` operator for integer division.",

Now, Sarah wants to package the remaining cupcakes in boxes of 8 each. The task is to determine how many packages she can make with the remaining cupcakes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cupcakes remaining after Todd ate 14 of them.\n   - Remaining cupcakes = Total cupcakes - Cupcakes eaten by Todd\n   - Remaining cupcakes = 38 - 14 = 24\n\n2.
