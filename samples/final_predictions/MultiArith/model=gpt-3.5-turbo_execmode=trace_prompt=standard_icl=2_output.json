                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given a relationship between the ages of Tom's brother and Tom's dog. Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `dog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears)` that takes the brother's age in six years and computes the dog's age in six years.\n2. Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the age of Tom's dog in six years based on the given conditions."

After accumulating his earnings for four weeks, he makes two sequential purchases: first, he spends half of his total savings on a video game, and then he spends a quarter of the remaining amount on a book. The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

Subtract the points lost in the last round:\n   - Total points at the end = Total points scored - Points lost in the last round\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_points\" that takes variables for points scored in each round and points lost in the last round.\n2. Assign constants to the points scored in the first two rounds and the points lost in the last round.\n3. Calculate the total points scored by summing the points in the first two rounds.\n4. Subtract the points lost in the last round to get the total points at the end of the game.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n6. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define points scored in each round\npoints_scored(first_round, 17).\npoints_scored(second_round, 6).\npoints_lost(last_round, 16).\n\n% Calculate total points at the end of the game\ncalculate_points(TotalPoints) :-\n    points_scored(first_round, FirstRoundPoints),\n    points_scored(second_round, SecondRoundPoints),\n    points_lost(last_round, LostPoints),\n    TotalPoints is FirstRoundPoints + SecondRoundPoints - LostPoints.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the points scored in each round and the points lost in the last round, calculates the total points scored in the first two rounds, subtracts the points lost in the last round, and determines the total points Carol had at the end of the game.",

Calculate the total number of students at the end by adding the initial number of students and the new students who joined, and then subtracting the students who left.\n3. Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations.\n4. Define predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's how the Prolog code structure might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define a rule to calculate the total number of students at the end of the year\ntotal_students_at_end(InitialStudents, StudentsLeft, NewStudents, TotalStudents) :-\n    TotalStudents is InitialStudents - StudentsLeft + NewStudents.\n\n% Define the initial values given in the problem\ninitial_students(10).\nstudents_left(4).\nnew_students(42).\n\n% Calculate the total number of students at the end\ntotal_students_at_end :-\n    initial_students(Initial),\n    students_left(Left),\n    new_students(New),\n    total_students_at_end(Initial, Left, New, Total),\n    write('Total number of students at the end of the year: '), write(Total).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule to calculate the total number of students at the end of the year based on the initial number of students, the students who left, and the new students who joined. The code then calculates and displays the total number of students at the end of the year.",

Two people got tired of waiting and left the line, while two more people joined the line. The task is to determine how many people would be in line after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of people in line after the changes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of people in line: 10.\n2. Subtract the two people who got tired of waiting and left: 10 - 2 = 8.\n3.

Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule \"people_in_line\" that takes variables for the initial number of people, the number of people who left, and the number of people who joined.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given a group consisting of 2 adults and 5 children who came to eat at Billy's Restaurant. Each meal costs $3. To find out the total bill for the group, we need to calculate the total cost of meals for both adults and children.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total bill, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of meals by adding the number of meals for adults and children.\n2. Multiply the total number of meals by the cost per meal to find the total bill.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of the total bill for the group at Billy's Restaurant. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_meals(Adults, Children, TotalMeals)` which calculates the total number of meals needed for the group. This rule will take the number of adults and children as input and output the total meals required.\n\n2. Define a rule `total_bill(TotalMeals, CostPerMeal, TotalCost)` which calculates the total bill based on the total number of meals and the cost per meal. This rule will output the total cost of the bill.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values (2 adults, 5 children, and $3 per meal) and use them to compute the total bill.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `TotalCost` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of meals needed\ntotal_meals(Adults, Children, TotalMeals) :-\n    TotalMeals is Adults + Children.\n\n% Define the total bill based on the number of meals and cost per meal\ntotal_bill(TotalMeals, CostPerMeal, TotalCost) :-\n    TotalCost is TotalMeals * CostPerMeal.\n\n% Sample query to find the total bill\n% ?- total_meals(2, 5, TotalMeals), total_bill(TotalMeals, 3, TotalCost).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total number of meals required and then calculates the total bill based on the cost per meal.

She found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 treasures on the second level. To calculate her total score, we need to multiply the number of treasures found on each level by the points awarded for each treasure and then sum up the scores.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Faye's total score, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the score for the treasures found on the first level: 2 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 14 points.\n2. Calculate the score for the treasures found on the second level: 6 treasures * 7 points/treasure = 42 points.\n3. Sum up the scores from both levels to get Faye's total score.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Faye's total score based on the number of treasures found on each level and the points awarded for each treasure. Here's how we can structure the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_score(Level1Treasures, Level2Treasures, TotalScore)` that takes the number of treasures found on each level and calculates the total score.\n2. Calculate the score for each level by multiplying the number of treasures found by 7 (points per treasure).\n3. Sum up the scores from both levels to get the total score.\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and return the total score.\n\nBy following this plan, we can create a SWI-Prolog code snippet that accurately calculates Faye's total score based on the treasures found on each level and the points awarded for each treasure.\n\nThe Prolog code will provide a straightforward and logical solution to determine Faye's total score in the video game.",

Calculate the total earnings for Tuesday by multiplying the number of hours worked on Tuesday (2 hours) by George's hourly wage.\n3. Add the earnings from Monday and Tuesday to find the total amount of money George made in those two days.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates George's total earnings for the two days based on the given information. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_earnings(Day1Hours, Day2Hours, HourlyWage, TotalEarnings)` that takes the number of hours worked on each day, the hourly wage, and calculates the total earnings.\n2. Calculate the earnings for each day by multiplying the hours worked on that day by the hourly wage.\n3. Sum up the earnings from both days to get the total earnings.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total earnings for two days\ncalculate_earnings(Day1Hours, Day2Hours, HourlyWage, TotalEarnings) :-\n    EarningsDay1 is Day1Hours * HourlyWage,\n    EarningsDay2 is Day2Hours * HourlyWage,\n    TotalEarnings is EarningsDay1 + EarningsDay2.\n\n% Query to find George's total earnings for Monday (7 hours) and Tuesday (2 hours) at $5/hour\nquery_total_earnings(TotalEarnings) :-\n    calculate_earnings(7, 2, 5, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_total_earnings(TotalEarnings)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the total amount of money George made in those two days based on the given conditions.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, Olivia earns 8 points for each treasure she finds in the video game. She found 2 treasures on the first level and 2 treasures on the second level. To calculate her total score, we need to multiply the number of treasures found by the points awarded for each treasure.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Olivia's total score, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Olivia found 2 treasures on the first level, so her score for the first level is 2 * 8 = 16 points.\n2. Olivia found 2 treasures on the second level, so her score for the second level is also 2 * 8 = 16 points.\n3. To find Olivia's total score, we sum the scores from both levels: 16 (first level) + 16 (second level) = 32 points.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this calculation in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Olivia's total score based on the number of treasures found on each level and the points awarded for each treasure. Here's how we can structure the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `calculate_score(Level1Treasures, Level2Treasures, TotalScore)` that takes the number of treasures found on each level and calculates Olivia's total score.\n2.

The task is to determine how many shelves Jerry would need to fill up to accommodate all the sodas he bought.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of sodas Jerry bought by adding the number of regular sodas and diet sodas.\n2. Determine the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf (9 sodas).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo write a SWI-Prolog code to determine the number of shelves Jerry would fill up, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a rule `calculate_total_sodas(RegularSodas, DietSodas, TotalSodas)` that calculates the total number of sodas by adding the number of regular sodas and diet sodas.\n2. Define a rule `calculate_shelves_needed(TotalSodas, ShelvesNeeded)` that calculates the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf.\n3.

Then, we determine the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of sodas by the capacity of each shelf (9 sodas) and rounding up to the nearest whole number using the `ceil` function. Finally, we use the given values to compute the number of shelves Jerry would fill up to accommodate all the sodas.",

The goal is to determine how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted given these conditions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of puppies in the shelter, the rate at which puppies are being adopted each day, and the number of puppies brought in. By calculating the net change in the number of puppies each day (adoptions minus new arrivals), we can determine the time it would take for all the puppies to be adopted.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the number of days required for all the puppies to be adopted based on the given information. Here's a structured plan to generate the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `days_to_adopt(InitialPuppies, NewPuppies, AdoptionRate, Days)` that calculates the number of days needed for all puppies to be adopted. This rule will consider the initial number of puppies, the number of new puppies brought in, and the adoption rate per day.\n\n2. Calculate the net change in the number of puppies each day by subtracting the adoption rate from the total number of puppies (initial + new).\n\n3. Determine the number of days required for all puppies to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the net change per day.\n\n4. Instantiate the rule with the given values (InitialPuppies as 9, NewPuppies as 12, AdoptionRate as 3) to find out the number of days needed for all puppies to be adopted.\n\n5. Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations and query the rule to obtain the result.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code snippet for this scenario would look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of days needed for all puppies to be adopted\ndays_to_adopt(InitialPuppies, NewPuppies, AdoptionRate, Days) :-\n    TotalPuppies is InitialPuppies + NewPuppies,\n    NetChange is AdoptionRate - NewPuppies,\n    Days is TotalPuppies / NetChange.\n\n% Query the rule with the given values\n% ?- days_to_adopt(9, 12, 3, Days).\n```\n\nBy executing the query with the defined rule and the provided values, we can determine the number of days required for all the puppies to be adopted.",

        "question": "There school's baseball team had 4 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 5 players in each group, how many groups would there be?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given the total number of new players and returning players on the school's baseball team. The coach wants to divide the players into groups with 5 players in each group. To determine the number of groups needed, we need to calculate the total number of players and then divide by 5 to find the number of groups.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of players by adding the number of new players and returning players.\n2.

Calculate the total points earned by Vanessa by dividing the pounds she recycled by 9.\n2. Calculate the total points earned by her friends by dividing the pounds they recycled by 9.\n3. Sum up the points earned by Vanessa and her friends to find the total points earned.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the total points earned by Vanessa and her friends. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the points earned based on the pounds of paper recycled by each person and then sums up these points to find the total.\n\n1. Define a predicate `points_recycled(Pounds, Points)` where `Pounds` is the amount of paper recycled and `Points` is the corresponding points earned.\n2. Define predicates for Vanessa's pounds recycled, her friends' pounds recycled, and the total points earned.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and addition operations required to calculate the total points earned.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\npoints_recycled(Pounds, Points) :- Points is Pounds // 9.\n\ntotal_points(VanessaPounds, FriendsPounds, TotalPoints) :-\n    points_recycled(VanessaPounds, VanessaPoints),\n    points_recycled(FriendsPounds, FriendsPoints),\n    TotalPoints is VanessaPoints + FriendsPoints.\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the pounds recycled and the points earned using Prolog predicates. We then calculate the points earned by Vanessa and her friends separately and sum them up to find the total points earned. This approach leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to efficiently solve the problem.",

To determine how many pages he would need to use, we need to divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we will perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cards by adding the new cards to the old cards: 3 new cards + 42 old cards = 45 cards.\n2. Divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page (5 cards) to find out how many pages Billy would need to use.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of pages Billy would use to organize his baseball cards. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total number of pages based on the total number of cards and the cards per page.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_cards(NewCards, OldCards, TotalCards)` where `NewCards` is the number of new cards, `OldCards` is the number of old cards, and `TotalCards` is the total number of cards.\n2. Define a predicate `calculate_pages(TotalCards, CardsPerPage, Pages)` where `TotalCards` is the total number of cards, `CardsPerPage` is the number of cards per page, and `Pages` is the total number of pages needed.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and calculate the number of pages required based on the total number of cards and cards per page.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_cards(NewCards, OldCards, TotalCards) :- TotalCards is NewCards + OldCards.\n\ncalculate_pages(TotalCards, CardsPerPage, Pages) :- Pages is TotalCards // CardsPerPage + (TotalCards mod CardsPerPage > 0).\n\nbilly_pages(NewCards, OldCards, CardsPerPage, Pages) :-\n    total_cards(NewCards, OldCards, TotalCards),\n    calculate_pages(TotalCards, CardsPerPage, Pages).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) to calculate the number of pages. We also consider the case where there might be additional cards that require an extra page. This approach leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to efficiently solve the problem.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a painter needs to paint a total of 12 rooms in a building, with each room taking 7 hours to paint. The painter has already completed painting 5 rooms, and the task is to determine how much longer it will take for the painter to finish painting the remaining rooms.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the additional time needed to paint the remaining rooms, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time needed to paint all 12 rooms: 12 rooms * 7 hours per room.\n2. Calculate the total time already spent painting the 5 rooms: 5 rooms * 7 hours per room.\n3. Subtract the total time spent from the total time needed to find out how much more time is required to paint the remaining rooms.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the additional time needed to paint the remaining rooms. The plan will involve defining predicates for calculating the total time needed, the total time spent, and then determining the additional time required.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_time_needed(TotalRooms, TimePerRoom, TotalTime)` to calculate the total time needed to paint all rooms.\n2.

The total number of cupcakes needed can be calculated by multiplying the number of attendees by the desired number of cupcakes per person.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n1.

Subtract the number of friends who couldn't come from the total number of friends invited to get the number of attendees.\n3.

Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations.\n5. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints.\n\nHere's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of friends invited and the number of friends who couldn't come\ninvited_friends(13).\nfriends_not_attending(7).\n\n% Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed\ncalculate_cupcakes_needed(TotalCupcakes) :-\n    invited_friends(Invited),\n    friends_not_attending(NotAttending),\n    Attendees is Invited - NotAttending,\n    CupcakesPerPerson = 4,\n    TotalCupcakes is Attendees * CupcakesPerPerson.\n```\n\nIn this Prolog code, we define the number of friends invited and the number of friends who couldn't come. We then calculate the number of attendees by subtracting the friends who couldn't come from the total invited. Finally, we calculate the total number of cupcakes needed by multiplying the number of attendees by the desired number of cupcakes per person.",

We need to calculate the total cost for the group to eat based on the given information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant, we need to consider the number of adults and kids in the group.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a trivia team initially consisted of 7 members, but only 5 members showed up for the game. Each member that attended the game scored 4 points. The task is to calculate the total number of points scored by the team members who showed up for the game.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of points scored by the team members who attended the game, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the number of team members who showed up for the game: 7 total members - 2 members who didn't show up = 5 members.\n2. Multiply the number of team members who attended by the points scored per member: 5 members * 4 points/member.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of points scored by the team members who attended the game. The plan involves setting up predicates to represent the number of total members, the number of absent members, the number of present members, and the points scored per member.\n\n1. Define a predicate `points_scored(TotalMembers, AbsentMembers, PointsPerMember, TotalPoints)` where `TotalMembers` is the total number of team members, `AbsentMembers` is the number of members who didn't show up, `PointsPerMember` is the points scored by each member, and `TotalPoints` is the total points scored.\n2. Calculate the number of present members by subtracting the absent members from the total members.\n3. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of present members by the points scored per member.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look like this:\n\n```prolog\npoints_scored(TotalMembers, AbsentMembers, PointsPerMember, TotalPoints) :-\n    PresentMembers is TotalMembers - AbsentMembers,\n    TotalPoints is PresentMembers * PointsPerMember.\n```\n\nBy defining this Prolog rule, we can easily calculate the total points scored by the team members who attended the game based on the given information and constraints.

Nancy started with 52 seeds, planted 28 seeds in the big garden, and distributed 4 seeds each in the small gardens. The task is to calculate how many small gardens Nancy has based on this information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the big garden**: 28 seeds were planted in the big garden.\n2. **Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens**: The remaining seeds after planting in the big garden are 52 - 28 = 24 seeds.\n3. **Determine the number of small gardens**: Each small garden received 4 seeds, so the number of small gardens can be calculated by dividing the total number of seeds planted in small gardens by the number of seeds per small garden.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo write a SWI-Prolog code to determine the number of small gardens Nancy has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a rule \"number_of_small_gardens\" that takes the total number of seeds planted in small gardens and the number of seeds per small garden as parameters.\n2. Calculate the total number of seeds planted in small gardens by subtracting the seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.\n3. Calculate the number of small gardens by dividing the total number of seeds planted in small gardens by the number of seeds per small garden.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nnumber_of_small_gardens(TotalSeedsSmallGardens, SeedsPerSmallGarden, NumberOfSmallGardens) :-\n    TotalSeedsBigGarden = 28,\n    TotalSeeds is 52,\n    TotalSeedsSmallGardens is TotalSeeds - TotalSeedsBigGarden,\n    NumberOfSmallGardens is TotalSeedsSmallGardens // SeedsPerSmallGarden.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively calculates the number of small gardens based on the given information about the seeds planted in the big garden and the small gardens.

        "question": "Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pics into one album and put the rest into 6 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley uploaded a total of 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pictures into one album and distributed the remaining pictures into 6 different albums. The task is to determine how many pictures were placed in each of the 6 different albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Subtract the 17 pictures placed in the first album from the total number of pictures to find out how many pictures are left to distribute among the 6 different albums.\n2. Divide the remaining pictures by 6 (the number of different albums) to determine how many pictures were placed in each of the 6 albums.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of pictures in each album. The plan will involve defining a rule that subtracts the pictures in the first album from the total and then divides the remaining pictures by the number of different albums.\n\n1. Define a predicate `pictures_in_each_album(TotalPictures, FirstAlbum, NumAlbums, PicturesPerAlbum)` where:\n   - `TotalPictures` is the total number of pictures uploaded (65 in this case).\n   - `FirstAlbum` is the number of pictures in the first album (17).\n   - `NumAlbums` is the total number of albums (6).\n   - `PicturesPerAlbum` is the number of pictures in each of the 6 different albums.\n\n2. Calculate the remaining pictures after placing 17 pictures in the first album: `RemainingPictures = TotalPictures - FirstAlbum`.\n3. Calculate the number of pictures in each of the 6 different albums: `PicturesPerAlbum = RemainingPictures / NumAlbums`.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of pictures in each album by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\npictures_in_each_album(TotalPictures, FirstAlbum, NumAlbums, PicturesPerAlbum) :-\n    RemainingPictures is TotalPictures - FirstAlbum,\n    PicturesPerAlbum is RemainingPictures / NumAlbums.\n```\n\nBy implementing this Prolog code, we can efficiently calculate the number of pictures that Haley placed in each of the 6 different albums based on the given information. This approach leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic calculation capabilities to solve the problem effectively.",

The remaining students are then divided into 8 groups. We need to calculate how many students would be in each group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract the number of students who did not get picked (10) from the total number of students (58) to find out how many students are left to be divided into groups.\n2. Divide the remaining number of students by the number of groups (8) to determine how many students would be in each group.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the number of students in each group based on the given information.\n\n1. **Define a predicate to calculate the number of students in each group**:\n   - Parameters: Total number of students, Number of students not picked, Number of groups.\n   - Returns: Number of students in each group.\n\n2. **Implement the predicate with actual values**:\n   - Use 58 for the total number of students, 10 for the number of students not picked, and 8 for the number of groups.\n\n3. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities** to perform the subtraction and division required to calculate the number of students in each group.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code in this way, we can efficiently compute the number of students in each group based on the given information.\n\n### Plan for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\nstudents_in_each_group(TotalStudents, NotPicked, NumGroups, StudentsInGroup) :-\n    RemainingStudents is TotalStudents - NotPicked,\n    StudentsInGroup is RemainingStudents // NumGroups.\n    \ncalculate_students_in_groups :-\n    TotalStudents = 58,\n    NotPicked = 10,\n    NumGroups = 8,\n    students_in_each_group(TotalStudents, NotPicked, NumGroups, StudentsInGroup),\n    format('Number of students in each group: ~d', [StudentsInGroup]).\n```\n\nIn this code prompt, we define a predicate `students_in_each_group/4` to calculate the number of students in each group.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, Paige picked 53 flowers for her friend's wedding and planned to make bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. However, 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. The task is to determine how many bouquets Paige can still make with the remaining flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers Paige can use by subtracting the wilted flowers from the total flowers she picked.\n2. Divide the total number of usable flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet to find out how many bouquets she can make.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate the number of bouquets Paige can make with the remaining flowers.\n\n1. Define a predicate `usable_flowers(Picked, Wilted, Usable)` where `Picked` is the total number of flowers picked, `Wilted` is the number of wilted flowers, and `Usable` is the total number of usable flowers.\n2. Define a predicate `bouquets_possible(Usable, Flowers_per_bouquet, Bouquets)` where `Usable` is the total number of usable flowers, `Flowers_per_bouquet` is the number of flowers in each bouquet, and `Bouquets` is the number of bouquets Paige can make.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and determine the number of bouquets Paige can make.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nusable_flowers(Picked, Wilted, Usable) :- Usable is Picked - Wilted.\nbouquets_possible(Usable, Flowers_per_bouquet, Bouquets) :- Bouquets is Usable // Flowers_per_bouquet.\n\npaige_bouquets(Picked, Wilted, Flowers_per_bouquet, Bouquets) :-\n    usable_flowers(Picked, Wilted, Usable),\n    bouquets_possible(Usable, Flowers_per_bouquet, Bouquets).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) to calculate the number of bouquets Paige can make with the remaining flowers.

        "question": "Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 40 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJerry initially put 40 pieces of clothing in one load for washing. He then had 20 pieces of clothing left to wash. Since he decided to split the remaining clothes into 5 equal loads, the task is to determine how many pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of clothing Jerry had: 40 (initial load) + 20 (remaining clothes) = 60 pieces.\n2. Determine the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each of the small loads by dividing the remaining clothes by the number of small loads (5).\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each of the small loads. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total number of pieces of clothing and then divides the remaining clothes into equal small loads.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_clothing(InitialLoad, Remaining, Total)` where `InitialLoad` is the number of clothes in the initial load, `Remaining` is the number of remaining clothes, and `Total` is the total number of clothes.\n2. Define a predicate `small_loads(Remaining, SmallLoads, PiecesPerLoad)` where `SmallLoads` is the number of small loads and `PiecesPerLoad` is the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each small load.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of pieces per small load by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_clothing(InitialLoad, Remaining, Total) :- Total is InitialLoad + Remaining.\nsmall_loads(Remaining, SmallLoads, PiecesPerLoad) :- PiecesPerLoad is Remaining // SmallLoads.\n\npieces_per_small_load(InitialLoad, Remaining, SmallLoads, PiecesPerLoad) :-\n    total_clothing(InitialLoad, Remaining, Total),\n    small_loads(Remaining, SmallLoads, PiecesPerLoad).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of pieces per small load, ensuring that only whole numbers of pieces can be distributed evenly.

Determine the number of folders needed to store these files, with each folder containing 5 files: 45 files / 5 files per folder.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of folders Katie ended up with. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the number of folders based on the number of remaining files and the files per folder constraint.\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_files(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, RemainingFiles)` where `TotalFiles` is the initial number of files, `DeletedFiles` is the number of files deleted, and `RemainingFiles` is the number of files left.\n2. Define a predicate `folders_needed(RemainingFiles, FilesPerFolder, Folders)` where `Folders` is the number of folders needed to store the remaining files.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of folders by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_files(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, RemainingFiles) :- RemainingFiles is TotalFiles - DeletedFiles.\n\nfolders_needed(RemainingFiles, FilesPerFolder, Folders) :- Folders is RemainingFiles // FilesPerFolder + (RemainingFiles mod FilesPerFolder > 0).\n\nkatie_folders(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, FilesPerFolder, Folders) :-\n    remaining_files(TotalFiles, DeletedFiles, RemainingFiles),\n    folders_needed(RemainingFiles, FilesPerFolder, Folders).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) along with modulo (`mod`) for calculating the number of folders, ensuring that any remaining files that do not fill a complete folder are accounted for. This approach leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic calculation capabilities to efficiently solve the problem.",
