Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on similar items. Thus, to find out how much Rachel should budget, we need to calculate Sara's total expenditure and then double that amount to find Rachel's budget.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate Sara's total expenditure by adding the cost of the shoes and the dress.\n2. Double Sara's expenditure to determine Rachel's budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of Rachel's budget based on the expenses of Sara. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent)` which calculates the total amount spent by Sara. This rule will take the cost of the shoes and the dress as input and output the total spent.\n   \n2. Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget. This rule will take the total spent by Sara as input and output the budget for Rachel by doubling Sara's expenditure.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (ShoesCost as $50 and DressCost as $200) and use them to compute the desired budget for Rachel.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `RachelBudget` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define how much Sara spent\ntotal_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent) :-\n    TotalSpent is ShoesCost + DressCost.\n\n% Define Rachel's budget as twice what Sara spent\nbudget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget) :-\n    RachelBudget is 2 * SaraSpent.\n\n% Sample query to find Rachel's budget\n% ?- total_spent_by_sara(50, 200, SaraSpent), budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total spent by Sara and then calculates Rachel's budget based on Sara's expenditure. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given costs of the shoes and dress, outputting the amount Rachel should budget."

Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `dog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears)` that takes the brother's age in six years and computes the dog's age in six years.\n2. Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the age of Tom's dog in six years based on the given conditions."

The balloon ascends at a rate of 50 feet per minute when the lift chain is pulled and descends at 10 feet per minute when the chain is not being pulled. He pulls the chain for two separate intervals of 15 minutes each and releases it for an interval of 10 minutes in between these periods. The task is to calculate the highest elevation reached during this ride.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the initial ascent: Jo-Bob pulls the chain for 15 minutes, causing the balloon to rise at 50 feet per minute.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n2. Calculate the descent after the first ascent: Jo-Bob releases the chain for 10 minutes, causing the balloon to descend at 10 feet per minute.\n   - Total descent = 10 minutes * 10 feet/minute = 100 feet.\n3. Calculate the second ascent: Jo-Bob again pulls the chain for 15 minutes at the same ascent rate.\n   - Total ascent = 15 minutes * 50 feet/minute = 750 feet.\n4. Calculate the highest elevation reached by adding the net gain after the first descent to the second ascent.\n   - Highest elevation = first ascent - first descent + second ascent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to model the balloon's behavior during ascent and descent and to calculate the highest elevation reached. The steps to construct the code are:\n\n1. Define predicates for ascent and descent that calculate the total change in height based on time and rate:\n   - `ascent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n   - `descent(Time, Rate, Height) :- Height is Time * Rate.`\n2. Define a predicate `balloon_ride` that calculates the highest elevation reached by using the ascent and descent predicates and considering the sequence of actions:\n   - `balloon_ride(HighestElevation) :- ascent(15, 50, Ascent1), descent(10, 10, Descent1), ascent(15, 50, Ascent2), HighestElevation is Ascent1 - Descent1 + Ascent2.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to compute the highest elevation:\n   - `?- balloon_ride(HighestElevation).`\n4. The code will use logical inference to determine the total heights for each ascent and descent phase and combine these to find the highest elevation reached.\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to model and solve the problem based on the given conditions of the balloon's ascent and descent rates and the times Jo-Bob pulls or releases the chain."

To determine the total time taken to complete all these activities, we need to sum up the time spent on each activity. These activities include getting in shape, learning mountain climbing, climbing the seven summits, learning diving, and diving through caves.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Getting in shape: 2 years.\n2. Learning mountain climbing: Twice the time taken to get in shape, i.e., 2 * 2 = 4 years.\n3. Climbing the seven summits: Each summit takes 5 months to climb, so for seven summits, 7 * 5 = 35 months. Since 12 months make a year, this is equivalent to 35 / 12 \u2248 2.92 years.\n4. Learning to dive: 13 months, which is 13 / 12 \u2248 1.08 years.\n5. Diving through caves: 2 years.\n\nTo find the total time spent, we need to sum all these durations.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the total time taken based on the given durations for each activity. Prolog's arithmetic capabilities will be used to perform the necessary calculations.\n\nThe blueprint to create a SWI-Prolog code for this scenario is as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_time` that takes variables for each activity duration and calculates the total time.\n2. Convert months to years where necessary to maintain consistency in units.\n3. Sum up the durations to get the total time.\n4. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code structure:\n\n1. Define a predicate `convert_months_to_years(Months, Years)` that converts months to years.\n2. Define a predicate `total_bucket_list_duration(GettingInShape, LearningClimbing, ClimbingSummits, LearningDiving, DivingCaves, TotalYears)` where:\n   - `GettingInShape` is 2 (years),\n   - `LearningClimbing` is 4 (years),\n   - `ClimbingSummits` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `LearningDiving` is calculated using `convert_months_to_years`,\n   - `DivingCaves` is 2 (years),\n   - `TotalYears` is the sum of all the above durations.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`) to perform the calculations and Prolog's logical inference to ensure the correct flow of data.\n\nThis structured approach leverages Prolog's capabilities to solve the problem through logical inference and arithmetic calculations, providing a clear and concise solution."

The task is to calculate the total cost of the meal and then determine how much each friend must pay if the bill is split equally among them. The items ordered include a Taco Salad, Dave's Single hamburgers, sets of french fries, and cups of peach lemonade, each with specific costs.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much each friend pays, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each item:\n   - Taco Salad: $10\n   - Dave's Single hamburgers: 5 orders at $5 each = $25\n   - French fries: 4 sets at $2.50 each = $10\n   - Peach lemonade: 5 cups at $2 each = $10\n\n2. Sum up these costs to get the total bill:\n   - Total bill = $10 (Taco Salad) + $25 (Hamburgers) + $10 (Fries) + $10 (Lemonade) = $55\n\n3. Divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend pays:\n   - Each friend pays = Total bill / 5\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our approach as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"calculate_bill\" that takes variables for each item's cost and the number of friends.\n2. Assign constants to the costs of individual items (e.g., cost of Taco Salad, cost of a hamburger).\n3. Compute the total cost for each type of item by multiplying the unit cost with the quantity ordered.\n4. Sum up all these total costs to get the final bill.\n5. Divide the final bill by the number of friends to determine how much each friend pays.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n7. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and logical inference to derive the solution based on the given problem constraints. Here's how the Prolog predicates might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define costs of items\nitem_cost(taco_salad, 10).\nitem_cost(hamburger, 5).\nitem_cost(fries, 2.5).\nitem_cost(lemonade, 2).\n\n% Calculate total cost of an item type\ntotal_item_cost(Item, Quantity, TotalCost) :-\n    item_cost(Item, CostPerItem),\n    TotalCost is CostPerItem * Quantity.\n\n% Calculate the total bill and how much each friend pays\ncalculate_bill(NumFriends, EachPays) :-\n    total_item_cost(taco_salad, 1, TotalTacoSalad),\n    total_item_cost(hamburger, 5, TotalHamburgers),\n    total_item_cost(fries, 4, TotalFries),\n    total_item_cost(lemonade, 5, TotalLemonade),\n    TotalBill is TotalTacoSalad + TotalHamburgers + TotalFries + TotalLemonade,\n    EachPays is TotalBill / NumFriends.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost of each item, calculates the total cost for each type of item based on the quantity, sums these to get the total bill, and finally computes the amount each friend pays by dividing the total bill by the number of friends."

Each video game costs $45, and each book costs $5. By the end of the summer, Kenny has mowed 35 lawns and wants to buy 5 video games. We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently."

After accumulating his earnings for four weeks, he makes two sequential purchases: first, he spends half of his total savings on a video game, and then he spends a quarter of the remaining amount on a book. The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nLuke aims to enhance his collection of games but faces the risk of potentially defective secondhand games. He acquires two games from a friend and an additional two from a garage sale. Unfortunately, two of these purchased games turn out to be non-functional. The central task is to determine the number of playable, or \"good,\" games in Luke's haul.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of good games, the following calculations should be made:\n\n1. Initialize the count of good games at zero.\n2. Add two games to the count, representing the games purchased from the friend, assuming they are functional.\n3. Add another two games, this time from the garage sale. However, since two games are known to be non-working, only one of these games can be considered \"good.\"\n4. Update the count by incrementing it by one to account for the single good game from the garage sale.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that iteratively adds the functional games to the count.

Define a predicate `number_of_good_games` that initializes the count of good games and iteratively adds to it based on the source of the games.\n2. Add two games for the functional ones from the friend's sale.\n3. When adding games from the garage sale, use a conditional statement to add only one game, as two of them were non-working.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to execute the predicates and calculate the final count of good games.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\nnumber_of_good_games(GoodGames) :-\n    GoodGames = 0, % Initialize the count of good games\n    add_games_from_friend(GoodGames, NewGoodGames), % Add games from friend\n    add_games_from_garage_sale(NewGoodGames, FinalGoodGames). % Add games from garage sale\n\nadd_games_from_friend(GoodGames, NewGoodGames) :-\n    NewGoodGames is GoodGames + 2. % Add two functional games\n\nadd_games_from_garage_sale(GoodGames, NewGoodGames) :-\n    NewGoodGames is GoodGames + 1. % Only add one functional game from the garage sale\n```\n\nThis code uses Prolog's logical flow control and arithmetic addition to compute the total number of good games that Luke ends up with after his shopping expedition. The structured approach ensures that the logic remains clear and concise.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe school cafeteria has ordered a certain number of red and green apples for students' lunches, but only a few students actually wanted fruit. The task is to calculate how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with. This involves comparing the total number of apples ordered with the number of apples desired by the students.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of extra apples, the following calculations should be done:\n\n1. Determine the total number of red apples ordered: 42 red apples.\n2. Determine the total number of green apples ordered: 7 green apples.\n3. Add these together to find the total number of apples ordered: 42 + 7 = 49 apples.\n4. Compare this with the number of apples desired by the students: 9 apples.\n5. Subtract the desired number of apples from the total number ordered to find the excess.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of extra apples based on the total apples ordered and the number of students who wanted fruit. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `extra_apples(TotalApplesOrdered, StudentDemand, ExtraApples)` that computes the number of extra apples.\n2. Instantiate the predicate with the actual values: `TotalApplesOrdered` as 49 (since there are 42 red and 7 green apples) and `StudentDemand` as 9.\n3. Subtract the number of apples desired by the students from the total apples ordered to find the excess: `ExtraApples is TotalApplesOrdered - StudentDemand`.\n4.

However, he could only wash 20 shirts before school started, and some shirts are still unwashed. The task is to find out how many shirts Oliver did not wash.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of short-sleeve shirts that need to be washed: 39 shirts.\n2. Calculate the total number of long-sleeve shirts that need to be washed: 47 shirts.\n3. Determine the total number of shirts that Oliver intended to wash. This is the sum of the short and long-sleeve shirts: 39 + 47 = 86 shirts.\n4. Subtract the number of shirts that were actually washed from the total to find the number of shirts left unwashed: 86 shirts - 20 shirts = 66 shirts.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a simple rule that calculates the number of shirts left unwashed. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `unwashed_shirts(TotalShortSleeve, TotalLongSleeve, Washed, LeftUnwashed)` that takes the total number of short and long sleeve shirts and the number of shirts washed, and returns the number left unwashed.\n2. Compute the total number of shirts that need washing by summing `TotalShortSleeve` and `TotalLongSleeve`.\n3. Subtract the number of shirts actually washed from the total number to find the number of shirts not washed.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is`) and logical inference to deduce the number of unwashed shirts.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would be a straightforward implementation of the problem based on the provided steps:\n\n```prolog\nunwashed_shirts(TotalShortSleeve, TotalLongSleeve, Washed, LeftUnwashed) :-\n    TotalShirts is TotalShortSleeve + TotalLongSleeve,\n    LeftUnwashed is TotalShirts - Washed.\n```\n\nThis code defines a clear relationship between the total shirts, the washed shirts, and the ones left unwashed.

Here's the structure:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `number_siameses/1` to represent the number of Siamese cats.\n   - `number_house_cats/1` for the number of house cats.\n   - `cats_sold/1` for the number of cats sold during the sale.\n   - `cats_left/2` to calculate the number of cats left in the store.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts to represent the initial number of each type of cat and the number of cats sold.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to compute the number of cats left.\n\n3. **Write the Query**:\n   - Ask Prolog to compute the number of cats remaining in the pet store after the sale.\n\nGiven this plan, the SWI-Prolog code could be written as follows:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of Siamese and house cats\nnumber_siameses(41).\nnumber_house_cats(28).\n\n% Cats sold during the sale\ncats_sold(15).\n\n% Calculate cats left in the store\ncats_left(InitialTotal, CatsSold, Left) :-\n    InitialTotal is number_siameses + number_house_cats,\n    Left is InitialTotal - CatsSold.\n\n% Query to find the number of cats left\nnumber_of_cats_left(Left) :-\n    cats_left(69, 15, Left).\n```\n\nThis code uses Prolog's logic and arithmetic capabilities to deduce the number of cats remaining in the pet store after the sale. The defined relationships between the number of cats make it possible to compute the solution.",

The remaining unused flowers are considered extra. The task is to calculate how many extra flowers Bianca has picked.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of extra flowers, we need to compare the total flowers picked with the number of flowers used. The difference between these two quantities will give us the number of extra flowers.\n\n1. Total flowers picked: Sum of tulips and roses picked, which is 39 + 49 = 88 flowers.\n2. Flowers used: 81 flowers.\n3. Extra flowers: The difference between the total picked and the flowers used, i.e., 88 - 81 = 7 flowers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this simple calculation using SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that computes the number of extra flowers based on the number of flowers picked and the number of flowers used. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `extra_flowers(TotalPicked, FlowersUsed, ExtraFlowers)` where:\n   - `TotalPicked` is the total number of flowers picked (tulips and roses).\n   - `FlowersUsed` is the number of flowers actually used for the bouquets.\n   - `ExtraFlowers` is the difference between the total picked and the flowers used.\n\n2. Use the rule by instantiating it with the given values: `TotalPicked` as 88 (39 tulips + 49 roses) and `FlowersUsed` as 81.\n\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to subtract `FlowersUsed` from `TotalPicked` to compute the number of `ExtraFlowers`.\n\nThe Prolog code will be straightforward, demonstrating how Prolog can efficiently handle mathematical problems using simple logic and arithmetic operations.\n\nHere's the code:\n```prolog\nextra_flowers(TotalPicked, FlowersUsed, ExtraFlowers) :-\n    ExtraFlowers is TotalPicked - FlowersUsed.\n\n% Query to find the extra flowers\n?- extra_flowers(88, 81, ExtraFlowers).\n```\n\nThis code and query will instantly tell us the number of extra flowers Bianca picked.",

However, after the sale, she had some pastries left over, and she took 32 of them back home.

The task is to calculate how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with after the lunch rush.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of extra apples, we need to compare the total number of apples ordered with the number of apples actually needed based on the demand from students.\n\n1. **Total Apples Ordered**: The cafeteria ordered a total of 25 red apples and 17 green apples, so there are 25 + 17 = 42 apples in total.\n\n2. **Apples Needed**: Only 10 students wanted fruit, so the number of apples needed is determined by the total number of students multiplied by the number of apples each student wanted. Since the problem doesn't specify, we can assume each student wanted one apple. Therefore, the number of apples needed is 10 apples.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of extra apples based on the total apples ordered and the number of students who wanted fruit.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWendy is engaged in an immersive video game adventure, starting with a substantial number of lives (43 to be precise). However, the game's difficulty increases suddenly, resulting in a substantial loss of 8 lives. Fortunately, the next level proves more forgiving, rewarding her with a gain of 39 lives. The central question is to determine Wendy's total lives after this tumultuous journey through the game's worlds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves simple arithmetic to calculate Wendy's remaining lives. We must subtract the lives lost from her initial stash and then add the lives gained in the next level.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, the following strategy can be employed:\n\n1. Define a rule named `calculate_lives` that takes the initial lives (`InitialLives`) and lives lost (`LivesLost`) as input and returns the remaining lives after the loss.\n2. Further, accommodate the lives gained in the next level by adding this value to the lives obtained from the previous step.\n\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's support for arithmetic operations to perform these calculations efficiently.\n3. Test the rule with Wendy's initial lives and lives lost to determine the final answer.\n\nThe Prolog code could be structured as follows:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate remaining lives\ncalculate_lives(InitialLives, LivesLost, RemainingLives) :-\n    RemainingLives is InitialLives - LivesLost.\n\n% Calculate the final number of lives after gains\nfinal_lives(InitialLives, LivesLost, LivesGained, FinalLives) :-\n    RemainingLives = calculate_lives(InitialLives, LivesLost),\n    FinalLives is RemainingLives + LivesGained.\n\n% Query to find Wendy's final lives with the given values\nwendys_lives(FinalLives) :-\n    final_lives(43, 8, 39, FinalLives).\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's simplicity in handling arithmetic computations while maintaining a clear logical structure, making it an effective tool for solving this problem.\n\nNow, with this plan in place, Wendy's final number of lives can be computed in a straightforward manner, allowing her to focus on enjoying the next thrilling section of the video game!",

New oranges are then added to the bin. The task is to determine the total number of oranges in the bin after this process.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of oranges in the bin, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1. Remove the old oranges that are being discarded.\n2. Add the new oranges to the bin.\n3. Compute the total number of oranges remaining in the bin.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to model this scenario and calculate the total number of oranges. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `oranges_in_bin` that represents the number of oranges in the bin. This rule will take the initial number of oranges as an input and return the total number of oranges after the addition of new oranges and the removal of old ones.\n\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations involving addition and subtraction to update the number of oranges.\n\n3.

Define a predicate `later_won_tickets/1` to represent the tickets Victor won later (39 tickets).\n4. Use a predicate `remaining_tickets/2` to calculate the number of remaining tickets after the purchase by subtracting the tickets spent from the initial tickets.\n5. Finally, define a predicate `total_tickets/2` that computes the total number of tickets by adding the later won tickets to the remaining tickets.\n\n6. Use swi-prolog's query system and the defined predicates to find the total number of tickets Victor has.\n\nThe corresponding Prolog code might look like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_tickets(46).\nspent_on_beanie(27).\nlater_won_tickets(39).\n\nremaining_tickets(InitialTickets, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is InitialTickets - spent_on_beanie(X).\n\ntotal_tickets(InitialTickets, Total) :-\n    remaining_tickets(InitialTickets, Remaining),\n    Total is Remaining + later_won_tickets(X).\n\n? - total_tickets(initial_tickets(A), TotalTickets).\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the different predicates to logically infer the total number of tickets, making the solution clear and modular.

The next day, she picked another 42 carrots. The task is to calculate the total number of carrots Chloe has after the two days of harvesting.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be approached by considering the sequence of Chloe's actions. Initially, she has 48 carrots, then subtracts 45 to account for the ones she threw out, and finally adds 42 carrots picked the next day. We need to sum the carrots retained after the first day and the new carrots picked on the second day.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this using SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that simulates the sequence of events, calculating the total number of carrots based on the actions taken by Chloe. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_carrots` that considers the number of carrots picked on the first and second days and accounts for the carrots thrown out.\n2. In the rule, calculate the number of carrots retained after the first day by subtracting the discarded carrots from the initially picked ones (48 - 45 = 3).\n3.

The task is to determine the total number of bottles of water Maria has in her fridge after this shopping trip.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves a simple addition of the remaining bottles after Maria drank some and the number of bottles she bought. The steps involved are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bottles remaining after Maria drank some: 14 initial bottles - 8 bottles consumed = 6 bottles.\n2.

The goal is to determine the total number of songs on her MP3 player after these operations.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the final count of songs on Robin's MP3 player, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Determine the number of songs deleted: 8 songs removed.\n2. Add the number of new songs: 10 new songs added.\n3. Sum the number of remaining old songs and the newly added songs.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes the total number of songs based on the input parameters. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a predicate `deleted_songs/1` to represent the number of songs deleted.\n2. Define a predicate `added_songs/1` to represent the number of new songs added.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_old_songs/1` to compute the number of old songs that remain after deletions. This can be achieved by subtracting the deleted songs from the initial total.\n4.

        "question": "Zoe had 42 bottles of water in her fridge. If she drank 25 of them and then bought 30 more, how many bottles would she have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nZoe has a substantial stock of bottled water in her fridge, initially counting 42 bottles. She consumes a significant portion of them, leaving her with a reduced number. However, she takes proactive steps to restock by purchasing 30 new bottles. The central question is to determine the total number of bottles Zoe now has after this consumption and subsequent purchase.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the final count of the water bottles, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Establish the initial count of the water bottles: this is known to be 42.\n\n2. Account for the consumed bottles. Subtract the number of bottles Zoe drank (25) from the initial count to arrive at the current count.\n\n3. Add the newly purchased bottles to the current count. This involves simply adding the number of bottles Zoe bought (30) to the post-consumption count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to formulate a rule that computes the total number of water bottles based on the provided input values. The following is a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_bottles` that accepts three parameters: `initial_count`, `consumed_bottles`, and `new_purchase`.\n\n2. Compute the current bottle count after consumption by subtracting `consumed_bottles` from `initial_count`.\n\n3. Establish the final count of bottles by adding the `new_purchase` to the post-consumption count computed in step 2.\n\n4. Employ SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and unification to execute these calculations and derive the final count of water bottles.\n\n5. Instantiate the predicates with the given values (initial count: 42, consumed bottles: 25, new purchase: 30) and query the rule to obtain the result.\n\nThe resulting Prolog code will logically infer the answer based on the provided steps and arithmetic operations.\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total number of bottles\ntotal_bottles(InitialCount, ConsumedBottles, NewPurchase, FinalCount) :-\n    CurrentCount is InitialCount - ConsumedBottles,\n    FinalCount is CurrentCount + NewPurchase.\n\n% Query to find the final number of water bottles\n% ?- total_bottles(42, 25, 30, FinalCount).\n```\n\nThis code exemplifies how Prolog can be applied to solve real-world problems involving sequential mathematical operations and logical relationships.",

Calculate Frank's balance after the game purchase by subtracting the cost of the game from his initial amount: `New Balance = Initial Balance - $3`.\n2. Add the amount received as allowance to the new balance to find the final balance: `Final Balance = New Balance + $14`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this scenario using SWI-Prolog, a rule can be defined that computes the final balance based on Frank's initial amount and the costs he incurred.

Define a rule `net_books_gained` that takes the number of initial books (`InitialBooks`) and the number of new books bought (`NewBooks`) as variables.\n2. Calculate the number of books sold by subtracting the initial number of books from the number of books sold: `BooksSold = NewBooks - InitialBooks`.\n3.

        "question": "Victor and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 8 dollars each. How much did they spend if Victor bought 6 decks and his friend bought 2 decks?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVictor and his friend visited a magic shop and purchased trick decks, each priced at $8. The task is to calculate the total amount of money they spent on these decks, considering Victor bought six decks and his friend bought two. To solve this, we need to multiply the number of decks purchased by each individual by the cost per deck and then add these amounts together.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to perform the following steps to calculate the total spending:\n\n1. Calculate Victor's total spending by multiplying the number of decks he purchased (6) by the cost per deck ($8).\n2. Calculate his friend's total spending using the same approach: Number of decks (2) * Cost per deck ($8).\n3. Sum up Victor's and his friend's individual spendings to find the total amount spent.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the total amount spent based on the number of decks purchased by Victor and his friend. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule `cost_per_deck` that specifies the cost of each deck, which is $8.\n2. Define a predicate `individual_spending(NumberDecks, TotalSpending)` that calculates the total spending of an individual by multiplying the number of decks purchased with the cost per deck.\n3. Define a predicate `total_spending` that adds up the individual spending of Victor and his friend to determine the overall total spending.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to deduce the final answer.\n\nThe following Prolog code snippet would implement this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost of each deck\ncost_per_deck(Cost) :- Cost is 8.\n\n% Calculate individual spending\nindividual_spending(NumDecks, TotalSpending) :- TotalSpending is NumDecks * 8.\n\n% Calculate the total spending\ntotal_spending(VictorSpending, FriendSpending, TotalAmountSpent) :-\n    individual_spending(6, VictorSpending), % Victor bought 6 decks\n    individual_spending(2, FriendSpending),  % Friend bought 2 decks\n    TotalAmountSpent is VictorSpending + FriendSpending.\n\n% Query to find the total amount spent\n?- total_spending(VictorSpend, FriendSpend, TotalAmount).\n```\n\nThis code uses simple arithmetic operations and the logical flow of the predicates to compute the solution, demonstrating Prolog's utility in solving real-world mathematical problems.",

The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule or fact called `number_of_pieces` that represents the number of pieces in one box.\n2. Multiply `number_of_pieces` by the total number of boxes to find the final count.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's basic arithmetic operations to perform the multiplication.\n4. Present the final answer as the total number of winter clothing pieces.\n\nThe Prolog code will be concise, relying on the built-in arithmetic capabilities of the language. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the number of pieces in one box\nnumber_of_pieces(10).\n\n% Calculate the total number of pieces across all boxes\ntotal_clothing_pieces(TotalPieces) :-\n    TotalPieces is 6 * number_of_pieces.\n```\n\nThis straightforward approach leverages Prolog's convenience for handling facts and simple arithmetic to solve Paige's unboxing problem, providing a logical and efficient solution.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe pet store has multiple bird cages, and each cage has multiple birds inside. The task is to calculate the total number of birds in the store by multiplying the number of cages with the number of birds per cage.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of birds in the store, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Multiply the number of cages (6) by the number of parrots per cage (2 parrots per cage).\n2. Multiply the number of cages by the number of parakeets per cage (7 parakeets per cage).\n3.

We need to calculate her total score across these two levels.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate Olivia's score, the following steps should be followed:\n\n1.

Sum these two amounts to find the total earnings.\n\n### Plan:\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that computes the total earnings based on the number of each type of necklace sold and the cost per necklace. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_earnings` with parameters for the number of bead necklaces sold (`NumBeadNecklaces`), the number of gemstone necklaces sold (`NumGemStoneNecklaces`), and the cost of each necklace (`CostPerNecklace`).\n2. Calculate the earnings from bead necklaces as the product of the number sold and the cost per necklace.\n3. Calculate the earnings from gemstone necklaces similarly by multiplying the number sold and the cost per necklace.\n4. Sum these two earnings values to find the `TotalEarnings`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and unification to solve for the total earnings.\n\nThe corresponding Prolog code might look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings(NumBeadNecklaces, NumGemStoneNecklaces, CostPerNecklace, TotalEarnings) :-\n    BeadEarnings is NumBeadNecklaces * CostPerNecklace,\n    GemStoneEarnings is NumGemStoneNecklaces * CostPerNecklace,\n    TotalEarnings is BeadEarnings + GemStoneEarnings.\n\n% Query to find the total earnings with the given numbers\nquery_total_earnings(TotalEarnings) :-\n    total_earnings(4, 3, 3, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis code allows us to input the number of necklaces sold for each type and retrieve the total earnings, demonstrating a practical application of Prolog in computing earnings based on sales and pricing.",

Here's how the code could look:\n\n```prolog\ncost_per_meal(3). % Defining the cost per meal as a fact\n\ntotal_bill(Meals, Cost) :-\n    TotalCost is Meals * Cost_per_meal(3), % Multiplying the number of meals by the cost per meal\n    Cost is TotalCost // 1.           % Using integer division to ensure the result is a whole dollar amount\n\n?- total_bill(8, Bill).           % Querying the total bill for 2 adults and 4 children\n```\n\nIn this code, we define the cost per meal as a fact, then create a predicate `total_bill` that calculates the total bill based on the number of meals and the known cost per meal. Finally, we query the predicate with the number of meals corresponding to Oliver's restaurant scenario (2 adults + 4 children) and retrieve the total bill. This demonstrates how Prolog can be used to solve real-world mathematical problems efficiently.",

        "question": "Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\nBianca is arranging books on her shelves, with a specific goal of having exactly 8 books on each shelf. She has multiple shelves dedicated to mystery books and picture books. The problem is to calculate the total number of books Bianca has based on the number of shelves for each category.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo determine the total number of books, the following approach can be taken:\n\n1. Each shelf of mystery books has 8 books, and Bianca has 5 such shelves. So, the total number of mystery books is: \n   8 * 5 = 40 books.\n\n2. Similarly, each shelf of picture books also holds 8 books. Bianca has 4 shelves of picture books, which equates to: \n   8 * 4 = 32 books.\n\n3. To find the total number of books, simply sum the number of mystery books and picture books: \n   Total Books = 40 (mystery) + 32 (picture) = 72 books.\n\n### Plan:\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a simple rule that multiplies the number of shelves by the books per shelf for both mystery and picture books. We then add these results together to obtain the total number of books. Prolog's arithmetic operations will be used for these calculations.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the code structure:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_books` that takes the number of mystery shelves and picture shelves as input.\n2. Multiply the number of mystery shelves by 8 and the number of picture shelves by 8 to find the books for each category.\n3. Sum the results from step 2 to find the total number of books.\n4. Provide the actual shelf counts as facts to query the defined rule and obtain the result.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_books(MysteryShelves, PictureShelves, TotalBooks) :-\n    TotalBooks is (MysteryShelves * 8) + (PictureShelves * 8).\n\nbianca_s_books :-\n    total_books(5, 4, Total),\n    write(Total).\n```\n\nThis code uses basic arithmetic operations and variable substitution to solve the problem efficiently.

        "question": "Billy was putting his spare change into piles. He had 2 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 4 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBilly has been organizing his spare change into different piles, with some piles containing quarters and others containing dimes. The task is to determine the total number of coins Billy has by calculating the sum of coins in all these piles. Each pile contains 4 coins, and we need to account for the number of piles of each type to find the total.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following approach can be taken:\n\n1. Identify the number of quarter piles, which is 2.\n2. Identify the number of dime piles, which is 3.\n3. Calculate the total number of coins by multiplying the number of coins per pile (4) by the total number of piles for each type of coin.\n4. Sum up the coins from both the quarter and dime piles to find the final total.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that computes the total number of coins based on the given information. Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities will be instrumental in deriving the solution.\n\n1. Define a rule `coin_count` that takes into account the number of quarter piles and dime piles and calculates the total number of coins.\n2. Multiply the number of coins per pile (4) by the respective number of quarter and dime piles to find the coins for each type.\n3. Sum up the coins from both types of piles to determine the final total.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to find the total number of coins by providing the number of quarter and dime piles as input to the defined rule.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code can be structured as follows:\n\n```prolog\ncoin_count(QuarterPiles, DimePiles, TotalCoins) :-\n    QuarterCoins is QuarterPiles * 4,\n    DimeCoins is DimePiles * 4,\n    TotalCoins is QuarterCoins + DimeCoins.\n\n?- coin_count(2, 3, Total).\n```\n\nIn this code, the `coin_count` predicate uses the number of quarter and dime piles to calculate the respective coin counts, which are then summed up to give the final total number of coins. The query at the end executes this computation for the given values, returning the correct total.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nChloe is engaged in a video game where she earns points by finding treasures. The game has multiple levels, with the first level awarding her 9 points per treasure and the second level potentially having a different point structure. The task is to calculate Chloe's total score based on the number of treasures found on each level.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate Chloe's score, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Determine the total score for the first level by multiplying the number of treasures found (6) by the points given for each treasure (9).\n2. Do the same for the second level, where she found 3 treasures.\n3. Sum up the scores from both levels to get Chloe's total score in the game.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to set up a rule that computes Chloe's total score based on the given values for the number of treasures found on each level.

Define a rule `score_per_level(Level, TreasuresFound, LevelScore)` that calculates the score for each level. `Level` will be either 1 or 2, `TreasuresFound` is the number of treasures found, and `LevelScore` is the score earned on that level.\n2. Define a rule `chloe_score(Score1, Score2, TotalScore)` that computes the total score by summing up the scores of both levels.\n3. Use constants representing the number of treasures found on each level (6 for level 1 and 3 for level 2) and invoke the rules to compute the total score.\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions and logical reasoning to deduce the correct total score.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be crafted as follows:\n\n```prolog\nscore_per_level(1, Treasures, Score) :- Score is 9 * Treasures.\nscore_per_level(2, Treasures, Score) :- Score is ...  % You might need to change the score per treasure for level 2, if given\nchloe_score(Score1, Score2, TotalScore) :- TotalScore is Score1 + Score2.\n\nchloe_total_score :-\n    score_per_level(1, 6, Score1),      % Assuming 9 points per treasure on level 1\n    score_per_level(2, 3, Score2),      % Assuming the number of treasures on level 2\n    chloe_score(Score1, Score2, TotalScore).\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's strength in logical reasoning and arithmetic operations to solve the problem efficiently, providing a clear and concise solution to Chloe's video game scoring quest.",

The task is to determine how many shelves they would need to display these bears, considering that each shelf can hold 6 bears.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate how many times the number of bears can be divided by the bears placed on each shelf. This will give us the number of shelves required.\n\n1. The total number of bears in stock after the shipment is 6 (initial) + 18 (new shipment) = 24 bears.\n2. We need to divide this total number of bears by the number of bears placed on each shelf.\n3.

Define a predicate `number_of_shelves(TotalBears, BearsPerShelf, Shelves)` that calculates the number of shelves needed based on the total bears and bears per shelf.\n2. Implement the integer division operation to find the result. This can be done by dividing `TotalBears` by `BearsPerShelf`.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe pet shelter has a large number of puppies that need to be adopted, with the initial count being 17 and a further 55 brought in. The task is to determine how long it would take for all these puppies to find new homes, considering that 8 puppies are adopted each day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the adoption period, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and then divide this number by the daily adoptions.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of puppies: 17 initial puppies + 55 newly brought in = 72 puppies.\n2. Divide the total number of puppies by the daily adoption rate: 72 puppies / 8 puppies/day = 9 days.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to perform the necessary calculations based on the given data. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `calculate_adoption_period` that takes the number of initial puppies (`InitialPuppies`) and the number of puppies brought in (`PuppiesBroughtIn`) as input and calculates the total number of puppies.\n2. Further, incorporate the daily adoption rate (`DailyAdoptions`) into the rule to compute the period required for all puppies to be adopted.\n3. Use simple arithmetic division to find the number of days required for adoption.\n4. Test the rule with the actual values mentioned in the problem: initial puppies (17), puppies brought in (55), and daily adoptions (8).\n\nThe corresponding SWI-Prolog code would look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate adoption period\ncalculate_adoption_period(InitialPuppies, PuppiesBroughtIn, TotalPuppies, DailyAdoptions, DaysRequired) :-\n    TotalPuppies is InitialPuppies + PuppiesBroughtIn,\n    DaysRequired is ceil(TotalPuppies / DailyAdoptions).\n\n% Query the rule with the actual values\n% ?- calculate_adoption_period(17, 55, _, 8, Days).\n% This should return the adoption period in terms of Days.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently computes the required adoption period by leveraging SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and demonstrates a practical application of logical programming in solving real-world problems.",

The task is to determine how many groups the coach needs to form with the given number of players.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the desired group size. The total number of players is given as 12 new players plus 44 returning players, which equals 56 players in total. The coach wants to form groups of 8 players each.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe school baseball team has a roster of 31 new players and 4 returning players, and the coach wants to organize them into groups for practice purposes. Each group should ideally have 7 players. The task is to determine how many groups the coach needs to form to accommodate all the players.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem involves simple division to find out how many groups are required. The total number of players is 31 new players plus 4 returning players, which equals 35 players in total.

The task is to determine how many groups will be formed under this arrangement.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a way to determine how many groups of four players can be formed when we have two new players and six returning players.\n\n1. The number of players per group is fixed at four, and we have a total of eight players (two new and six returning).\n2. We can start by calculating the quotient and remainder when dividing the total number of players by the number of players per group.\n3. If the quotient happens to be the number of groups, the remainder will indicate the number of players left over who couldn't form a complete group.\n4.

        "question": "Nancy's old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNancy has a capacity constraint when using her old washing machine, as it can only handle 9 pieces of clothing per wash cycle. With a large pile of 19 shirts and 8 sweaters, she needs to strategically plan the number of wash cycles required to clean all her clothes. The problem is to calculate the total number of loads Nancy will have to run.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of loads, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Divide Nancy's clothes into groups of 9 pieces each.\n2. The remaining items that don't divide evenly by the machine's capacity will require one additional load.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to mimic this logical division of clothes and calculate the required number of loads. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `number_of_loads` that takes the total number of items (shirts and sweaters) and the machine's capacity as input.\n2. Calculate the number of full loads by dividing the total number of items by the machine's capacity.\n3. Calculate the remaining items that don't fit into a full load.\n4. Determine if any additional load is required for these remaining items. If the remainder is greater than 0, add 1 to the total loads.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to implement these calculations.\n\nHere's a sample Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the washing machine capacity\ncapacity(9).\n\n% Calculate the number of loads\nnumber_of_loads(TotalItems, MachineCapacity, NumberOfLoads) :-\n    FullLoads is TotalItems // MachineCapacity,\n    RemainingItems is TotalItems mod MachineCapacity,\n    NumberOfLoads is FullLoads + (if(RemainingItems > 0, 1, 0)).\n```\n\nBy structuring the code this way, it will efficiently calculate the required number of loads for Nancy's laundry based on the given constraints, showcasing Prolog's utility in solving real-world problems with logical reasoning.",

However, he can only carry four trays at a time. To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trips Luke will have to make to clear all the trays.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe can approach this problem by dividing it into two parts: clearing the trays from the first table and clearing the trays from the second table.\n\n1. Clearing the first table: The number of trays at the first table (20 trays) needs to be divided by the number of trays Luke can carry in one trip (4 trays), which will give us the number of trips required for the first table.\n\n2. Clearing the second table: Similarly, find the number of trips needed to clear the trays from the second table by dividing the number of trays (16) by Luke's capacity (4 trays).\n\nFinally, we need to sum these two values to get the total number of trips Luke will make.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the number of trips based on the given input for the number of trays at each table and Luke's capacity. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule called `number_of_trips` that takes three parameters: `TraysTable1`, `TraysTable2`, and `TraysPerTrip`, representing the number of trays at each table and Luke's capacity per trip, respectively.\n2.

He has both new cards (8 of them) and old cards (16 of them) that he needs to accommodate in this binder. The task is to determine how many pages John will use to fit all his cards.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cards John has and then divide this number by the cards per page to find the required number of pages.\n\n1. John has a total of 8 new cards and 16 old cards, so the total number of cards is: Total Cards = 8 + 16 = 24 cards.\n2.

Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_toys` that takes into account Paul's savings (`Savings`) and allowance (`Allowance`) and calculates the total amount. The cost of each toy (`CostPerToy`) will be a separate parameter.\n2. Calculate the total money available by adding Paul's savings and allowance.\n3. Divide the total money by the cost per toy to find the maximum number of toys Paul can buy.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical inference capabilities to implement this logic and find the solution.\n\nThe following Prolog code snippet would reflect this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of toys\nnumber_of_toys(Savings, Allowance, CostPerToy, NumberOfToys) :-\n    TotalMoney is Savings + Allowance,\n    NumberOfToys is floor(TotalMoney / CostPerToy).\n\n% Query the rule with Paul's savings and allowance\nquery_number_of_toys(NumberOfToys) :-\n    number_of_toys(4, 11, 5, NumberOfToys).\n```\n\nThis code uses logical inference and arithmetic operations in Prolog to solve the problem, demonstrating a practical application of Prolog in computing a real-world scenario.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\nKatie has uploaded a total of 30 phone pictures and 51 camera pictures to Facebook. After sorting these pictures into albums, Katie ends up with a fixed number of pictures in each album. The goal is to determine how many pictures are in each of these albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of pictures in each album, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures by summing the pictures from the phone and camera uploads: 30 (phone) + 51 (camera) = 81 pictures.\n\n2. Divide the total number of pictures by the desired number of albums to find the number of pictures in each album:\n   - Number of pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums\n\n3. Since Katie wants to distribute the same number of pictures into each album, we need to determine this equal count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to compute the number of pictures in each album based on the total count and the number of albums. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `pictures_per_album` that takes the total_pictures and number_of_albums as input and calculates the pictures_in_each_album.\n\n2.

The task is to calculate the cost of the rides Adam enjoyed on the Ferris wheel, which can be determined by finding the difference between the initial and final ticket counts and then multiplying by the cost per ticket.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Determine the number of tickets Adam used for the Ferris wheel by subtracting the number of tickets left from the initial count: `Tickets Used = Initial Tickets - Final Tickets`.\n2. Calculate the cost of these tickets at the given cost per ticket: `Cost = Tickets Used * Cost per Ticket`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a logical relationship between the initial tickets, final tickets, and the cost per ticket, and then computing the cost.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJohn earns a fixed rate of $8 for each lawn he mows. He had a total of 15 lawns to mow but forgot to mow 7 of them. The task is to calculate John's actual earnings after this oversight.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find John's actual earnings, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Calculate the potential earnings: This is the earnings John would have received if he had mowed all 15 lawns, which is simply the number of lawns multiplied by the earnings per lawn.\n2. Subtract the earnings from the lawns John forgot to mow to determine his actual earnings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this scenario in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates John's actual earnings. The plan involves setting up a predicate that represents the earnings per lawn and then performing calculations based on the number of lawns mowed and forgotten.\n\n1. **Define a Predicate**:\n   - `earnings_per_lawn/1` to represent the earnings for each lawn mowed.\n   - `lawns_mowed/1` to represent the number of lawns John actually mowed.\n   - `lawns_forgotten/1` to represent the number of lawns John forgot to mow.\n\n2. **Calculate Potential Earnings**: Multiply the earnings per lawn by the total number of lawns to determine what John would have earned if he hadn't forgotten any lawns.\n\n3. **Calculate Actual Earnings**: Subtract the earnings from the forgotten lawns from the potential earnings to arrive at John's actual income.\n\n4. **Write the Rule**: Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and determine the actual earnings.\n\n5. **Test the Rule**: Apply the rule with the given values (earnings per lawn: $8, lawns to mow: 15, lawns forgotten: 7) and check if the output matches the expected actual earnings.\n\nThis approach breaks down the problem into logical steps, and the SWI-Prolog code will reflect this structure, making the solution clear and concise.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the earnings rate and the number of lawns\nearnings_per_lawn(8).\nlawns_mowed(X) :- lawns(X).\nlawns_forgotten(7).\n\n% Calculate potential earnings\npotential_earnings(Earnings, Rate, Lawns) :-\n    Earnings is Rate * Lawns.\n\n% Calculate actual earnings\nactual_earnings(Potential, LawnsMowed, LawnsForgotten, Actual) :-\n    Actual is Potential - (LawnsForgotten * earnings_per_lawn).\n\n% Compute the actual earnings with the given values\njohns_actual_earnings :-\n    potential_earnings(Potential, earnings_per_lawn, lawns_mowed),\n    actual_earnings(Potential, lawns_mowed, lawns_forgotten, ActualEarnings),\n    write(ActualEarnings).\n\n% Run the query\nmain :- johns_actual_earnings.\n```\n\nWith this code in place, running `main` will output John's actual earnings after forgetting to mow some lawns.",

Determine the number of lives per player: 8 lives per player.\n2. Calculate the number of remaining players by subtracting the number of players who quit from the initial total: 10 initial players - 7 players who quit = 3 remaining players.\n3. Multiply the number of lives per player by the number of remaining players to find the total lives after some players quit.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a logical relationship between the initial number of players, the number of players who quit, and the number of lives per remaining player. The plan involves setting up a rule that computes the total lives based on these parameters.\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_lives` that takes the initial number of players (`InitialPlayers`), the number of players who quit (`PlayersQuit`), and the number of lives per remaining player (`LivesPerPlayer`) as input.\n2.

Determine the number of enemies defeated: Subtract the enemies left from the total number of enemies. In this case, subtract 2 from 7 to get 5 defeated enemies.\n2. Multiply the number of defeated enemies by the points earned per enemy: 5 enemies * 8 points/enemy.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a simple rule that calculates the points earned based on the given information. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `points_earned` that takes the number of enemies defeated and multiplies it by the points earned per enemy.\n2.

Identify the number of working video games. Since two games are not working, subtract these from the total to find the number of working ones: WorkingGames = TotalGames - 2.\n2.

        "question": "April's discount flowers was having a sale where each rose was 4 dollars. If April started with 13 roses and had 4 roses left, how much money did she earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nApril's flower shop, Discount Flowers, held a sale where each rose was priced at $4. She started with 13 roses and now only has 4 roses left, indicating that she sold a majority of them. The task is to calculate the total earnings from the rose sales.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money April earned, we need to determine the number of roses sold and then multiply this by the price per rose.\n\n1. Roses Sold: The difference between the initial and final count of roses gives us the number of roses sold.\n   - Number of roses sold = Initial count - Final count\n   - Roses sold = 13 roses - 4 roses = 9 roses\n\n2. Total Earnings: Multiplying the number of roses sold by the price per rose will give us the total earnings.\n   - Total earnings = Roses sold * Price per rose\n   - Total earnings = 9 roses * $4/rose = $36\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates April's total earnings based on the number of roses sold and the price per rose. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `april_earn(PricePerRose, InitialRoses, RemainingRoses, TotalEarnings)` that takes the price per rose and the initial and remaining number of roses as input and returns the total earnings.\n2. Calculate the number of roses sold by subtracting the remaining roses from the initial roses.\n3. Multiply the number of roses sold by the price per rose to obtain the total earnings.\n4.

        "question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a group of 15 people, including 8 kids, plans to eat at a restaurant with a unique pricing structure. Adult meals cost $5 each, while kids eat for free. The task is to determine the total cost for the entire group to dine at the restaurant.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total cost for the group, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Identify the number of adults in the group, which is the total group size minus the number of kids: Number of Adults = 15 - 8 = 7 adults.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for the adults by multiplying the cost per adult meal: Total Adult Cost = 7 adults * $5/meal = $35.\n\n3. As kids eat free, the total cost for the group is solely determined by the number of adult meals.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the group meal cost based on the given parameters. The plan involves setting up a predicate that represents the cost calculation and then using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the computation.\n\n1. **Define the Rule**: Create a predicate `group_meal_cost(TotalCost)` that represents the total cost of the group's meal. This predicate will use the number of adults and the cost per adult meal as variables.\n\n2. **Calculate Number of Adults**: Subtract the number of kids from the total group size to determine the number of adults: `Number of Adults = TotalGroupSize - NumberofKids`.\n\n3. **Compute Total Cost**: Multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult meal to find the total cost: `TotalCost is NumberofAdults * CostPerAdultMeal`.\n\n4. **Test the Rule**: Use the provided group size (15) and the number of kids (8) to query the predicate and infer the total cost of the meal for the group.\n\nThis approach leverages SWI-Prolog's strengths in logical reasoning and arithmetic operations. By defining a clear and structured predicate, we can obtain the desired result efficiently.\n\nHere's the Prolog code based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost per adult meal\ncost_per_adult_meal(Cost) :- Cost is 5.\n\n% Compute the total cost of the group's meal\ngroup_meal_cost(TotalGroupCost) :-\n    NumberofKids is 8,            % Number of kids is given as 8\n    NumberofAdults is 15 - NumberofKids, % Calculate number of adults\n    cost_per_adult_meal(CostPerAdultMeal),  % Define cost per adult meal\n    TotalGroupCost is NumberofAdults * CostPerAdultMeal.  % Compute total cost\n\n% Query to find the total meal cost for the group\ntotal_cost(Total) :- group_meal_cost(Total).\n```\n\nWith this code in place, querying `total_cost(Cost)` will return the total meal cost for the group of 15 people with 8 kids, based on the restaurant's pricing policy.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe chef has a large batch of 15 potatoes to cook, and he has already cooked 8 of them. The remaining potatoes need to be cooked, and each potato requires 9 minutes in the oven. The task is to calculate the total time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to determine the time required to cook the uncooked potatoes.\n\n1. **Remaining Potatoes**: Find out how many potatoes are left to cook. This can be done by subtracting the number of potatoes already cooked from the total number: 15 (total) - 8 (cooked) = 7 (remaining).\n\n2. **Time Calculation**: Multiply the number of remaining potatoes by the time it takes to cook a single potato. This will give us the total time required: 7 potatoes * 9 minutes/potato = 63 minutes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes. The plan involves setting up a predicate that takes into account the number of potatoes already cooked and uses arithmetic operations to find the time required.\n\n1. **Define the Predicate**: Create a rule named `remaining_cook_time` that takes the number of potatoes already cooked (`CookedPotatoes`) and returns the time required to cook the remaining potatoes in minutes.\n\n2. **Implement the Logic**: \n   - Subtract the number of cooked potatoes from the total number to find the remaining potatoes.\n   - Multiply the number of remaining potatoes by the cooking time per potato to get the total time.\n\n3. **Use SWI-Prolog's Arithmetic Operations**: Perform the above calculations using the `is` operator and unification to solve for the answer.\n\n4. **Test the Rule**: Input the number of potatoes already cooked (8) and ensure the output matches the expected remaining cook time (63 minutes).\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_cook_time(CookedPotatoes, RemainingTime) :-\n    TotalPotatoes is 15,\n    RemainingPotatoes is TotalPotatoes - CookedPotatoes,\n    RemainingTime is RemainingPotatoes * 9.\n\nchef_remaining_time(Time) :-\n    remaining_cook_time(8, Time).\n```\n\nThis code defines a clear relationship between the input and output, leveraging Prolog's strengths in logical reasoning and arithmetic operations to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "question": "At lunch a waiter had 7 customers and 4 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $9 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, a waiter serves seven customers during lunch, but not all of them leave a tip. The task is to calculate the total money earned by the waiter from the customers who did leave a tip. Each of these customers tipped the waiter $9.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total earnings, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Determine the number of customers who tipped the waiter. Since four customers didn't tip, the number of customers who tipped is the difference between the total number of customers and those who didn't tip: 7 - 4 = 3 customers.\n2. Calculate the total money earned by multiplying the number of tipping customers by the amount of the tip: 3 customers * $9 per customer = $27.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that computes the total earnings based on the number of customers and the amount of the tip. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `waiter_earnings` that takes the number of customers who tipped as an input and returns the total earnings.\n2. Use basic arithmetic operations to calculate the total earnings: multiply the number of tipping customers by the tip amount.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's inference engine to compute the number of customers who tipped (by subtracting the non-tipping customers from the total).\n4. Instantiate the rule with the known values (total customers = 7, non-tipping customers = 4, tip amount = $9) to compute the earnings.\n\nThe Prolog code will be constructed to represent these logical steps, leveraging Prolog's strengths in logical reasoning and arithmetic computations.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Outline:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate waiter's earnings\nwaiter_earnings(NumberTippingCustomers, TotalEarnings) :-\n    NumberNonTippingCustomers is 4, % Known value\n    NumberTippingCustomers is 7 - NumberNonTippingCustomers,\n    TotalEarnings is NumberTippingCustomers * 9.  % $9 per customer\n\n% Compute the earnings with the given values\n?- waiter_earnings(X, TotalEarnings), write(TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nThis code uses logical inference to determine the number of customers who tipped and then computes the total earnings using the given tip amount, demonstrating how Prolog can be applied to real-world scenarios with quantitative data.",

The task involves calculating the total cost to complete John's collection.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe need to calculate the total cost by determining the number of action figures John needs to purchase and then multiplying this number by the cost of a single figure.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of figures required**:\n   - John already has 6 figures, and he needs 11 in total, so he requires 11 - 6 = 5 more figures.\n\n2. **Determine the total cost**:\n   - The cost of one figure is known to be $6, so multiplying this by the number of figures needed will give us the total cost.\n   - Total cost = Cost per figure * Number of figures required = $6 * 5 = $30.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this simple calculation using SWI-Prolog as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule named \"cost_of_collection\" that takes a variable for the cost of one action figure and returns the total cost to complete the collection.\n2. Use a simple arithmetic operation to compute the number of additional figures needed.\n3. Multiply the cost of one figure by the number of required figures to obtain the total cost.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's built-in arithmetic capabilities to perform this computation.\n\nThe Prolog code will be straightforward, relying on the logical relationships and arithmetic operations provided in the problem statement. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```prolog\ncost_of_collection(CostPerFigure, TotalCost) :-\n    AdditionalFigures is 11 - 6,  % Compute the number of figures John needs\n    TotalCost is CostPerFigure * AdditionalFigures.  % Compute the total cost\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how SWI-Prolog can be used to solve simple arithmetic problems involving logical relationships and calculations.",

        "question": "At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThis problem involves determining the cost of a meal for a group of 11 people, consisting of two kids, at a restaurant with a unique pricing structure. The cost for adult meals is set at $8 each, while kids eat for free. The task is to calculate the total cost for the entire group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo calculate the total cost, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Identify the number of adult meals, which is the total group size minus the number of children: 11 total people - 2 kids = 9 adult meals.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of adult meals: 9 adult meals * $8 per adult meal = $72.\n\n3. As kids eat free, there is no additional cost for the two children in the group.\n\nThe total cost for the group's meal is therefore the cost of the adult meals, which is $72.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will implement this straightforward problem in SWI-Prolog by defining a rule that calculates the total meal cost based on the number of adults and children in the group. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_meal_cost` that takes the number of adults and kids as input and returns the total cost.\n\n2. Use basic arithmetic to compute the cost of adult meals: number of adults * cost per adult meal ($8).\n\n3. As kids' meals are free, their number does not affect the total cost, so we don't need to include them in the calculation.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query system to find the total cost with a sample group of 11 people, including 2 kids.\n\nThe Prolog code will be concise, relying on Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculation based on the given input.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the cost of an adult meal\nadult_meal_cost(8).\n\n% Calculate the total meal cost\ntotal_meal_cost(AdultCount, KidsCount, TotalCost) :-\n    adult_cost is AdultCount * adult_meal_cost,\n    TotalCost = adult_cost.\n\n% Query to find the total cost for a group of 11 people with 2 kids\ntotal_cost_for_group :-\n    total_meal_cost(9, 2, Cost),\n    write(Cost).\n```\n\nThis code defines the cost of an adult meal and a rule to calculate the total cost based on group dynamics.

The task is to determine how many folders Megan ends up with after this organization.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of folders Megan has after organizing her files, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. Calculate the number of files remaining after deletions: Megan starts with 93 files and deletes 21, leaving her with 72 files.\n\n2. Divide the remaining files into folders of 8: To find out how many folders are needed, divide the number of remaining files by the desired number of files per folder.\n   - Number of folders = 72 (remaining files) / 8 (files per folder)\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that computes the number of folders based on the number of remaining files after deletions. We can break down the problem into these steps:\n\n1. Define a rule `remaining_files` that calculates the number of files left after deletions. This can be done by subtracting the number of deleted files from the total files.\n2. Define a rule `number_of_folders` that divides the remaining files by the files per folder to return the required number of folders.\n3.

Calculate the total number of remaining pictures after placing 44 pictures in one album. This is done by subtracting 44 from the total of 79 pictures.\n2.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule, `problems_per_page(TotalProblems, PageProblems)`, that computes the number of problems on each page. `TotalProblems` represents the total count of remaining problems, and `PageProblems` denotes the problems per page.\n2.

Now, the company needs to rearrange the seating by setting up tables, each designed to accommodate three people.

The task is to determine the number of players on Emily's team by analyzing the given scoring information. We need to calculate the total number of points scored by players other than Emily and divide this by the points scored by each player.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Emily scored 23 points, and other players scored the remaining points. The remaining points can be calculated as: `Total Points - Emily's Points = 39 - 23 = 16 points`.\n\n2. We know that each player on Emily's team, excluding Emily, scored 2 points. Therefore, we can find the number of such players by dividing the remaining points by the points per player: `Number of Players = 16 / 2 = 8 players`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this problem in SWI-Prolog, we'll define a rule that calculates the number of players on Emily's team based on the given scoring details. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_players` that takes the total_points and emily_points as input and calculates the number of players.\n2.

The task is to determine how many shelves were used to display the remaining coloring books.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of shelves used, we need to divide the remaining coloring books by the number of books placed on each shelf.\n\n1.

This can be achieved by subtracting the seeds planted in the big garden from the total seeds available and then dividing the result by the number of seeds in each small garden.\n\n1. Total seeds dedicated to small gardens = Total seeds available - Seeds in big garden.\n2.

She placed 10 pictures in one album and distributed the remaining pictures across 5 different albums. The task is to determine the number of pictures present in each album.\n\n### Analysis:\nTo solve this problem, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of remaining pictures after placing 10 photos in one album. This is done by subtracting 10 from the total of 25 pictures.\n\n2.

The task is to determine how many tables are needed to accommodate the attendees who did show up, considering that each table can seat two people comfortably.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis problem can be solved by calculating half the number of attendees, as each table seats two people. We simply need to divide the number of attendees by two to find the required number of tables.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe solution can be implemented using SWI-Prolog as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_tables` that takes the number of attendees as an input and calculates half of this number, representing the number of tables required.\n2.

However, some of the flowers wilted before the wedding, reducing the number of usable flowers. The task is to determine how many complete bouquets Paige can still make with the remaining flowers, given that each bouquet contains seven flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many bouquets Paige can make, the following calculations are required:\n\n1. Calculate the number of flowers that wilted: 53 total flowers - usable flowers = 18 wilted flowers.\n2. Determine the number of flowers still usable: 53 total flowers - 18 wilted flowers = 35 usable flowers.\n3. Divide the number of usable flowers by the flowers per bouquet to find the number of bouquets: 35 usable flowers / 7 flowers/bouquet.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can implement this scenario using SWI-Prolog by defining rules that calculate the number of usable flowers and then determining the number of bouquets based on these flowers. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `wilted_flowers(TotalFlowers, WiltedCount)` that calculates the count of wilted flowers. This rule uses the total number of flowers picked and the number of wilted flowers as inputs.\n\n2.

The question is, how many folders will Wendy need to accommodate all the remaining files?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the remaining files after deletions need to be divided evenly into folders, each holding five files. The number of folders can be found by dividing the total remaining files by the number of files per folder.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to perform this division and calculate the required number of folders. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `number_of_folders` that takes the total_files (the remaining files after deletions) as input and returns the NumberOfFolders required.\n2. Divide the total_files by the files_per_folder (5, in this case) to find the exact number of folders needed.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and integer division to perform this calculation.\n4. Test the rule with the given total number of remaining files (37) and infer the number of folders required.\n\nThe Prolog code would look like this:\n\n```prolog\nnumber_of_folders(TotalFiles, NumberOfFolders) :-\n    NumberOfFolders is TotalFiles // 5.\n\nwendy_folders(RemainingFiles) :-\n    number_of_folders(RemainingFiles, Folders),\n    write(Folders).\n\n% Test with Wendy's remaining files\n?- wendy_folders(37).\n```\n\nThis code uses logical inference and arithmetic operations to provide an answer to Wendy's folder organization query. The plan outlines a straightforward approach to solve the problem, demonstrating how Prolog can assist in real-world, numerical problem-solving scenarios.",

The task is to determine how many tables are needed to accommodate these attendees, considering that each table can seat seven people comfortably.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of tables required based on the attendance.

The goal is to determine how many shelves are needed to display the remaining coloring books, considering that each shelf holds a specific number of books (5 in this case).\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many shelves are used, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale.\n2. Divide the number of remaining books by the number of books placed on each shelf.\n3.

The rule will use the total number of candies and the number of candies eaten.\n2. Define a rule `number_of_piles(RemainingCandies, Piles)` that determines the number of piles Bianca can make. This can be found by dividing the remaining candies by the candies per pile (5).\n\n3. Use the rules and actual values from the problem (e.g., TotalCandies is 32 and EatenCandies is 12) to query and find the number of piles.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will use integer division to find the number of piles and can be structured as follows:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for remaining candies\nremaining_candies(total, eaten, remaining) :-\n    Remaining is total - eaten.\n\n% Define the rule for number of piles\nnumber_of_piles(remaining, piles) :-\n    Piles is remaining // 5.\n\n% Query to find the number of piles\nnumber_of_piles_query(Piles) :-\n    remaining_candies(32, 12, Remaining),\n    number_of_piles(Remaining, Piles).\n```\n\nThis code uses the logical relationships between the variables to infer the solution.

        "question": "Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSarah has baked 38 cupcakes for a bake sale, but her brother Todd has eaten 14 of them. Sarah wants to package the remaining cupcakes into packs of 8. The task is to determine how many packages Sarah can make under these circumstances.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many packages Sarah can create, we need to calculate the number of remaining cupcakes after Todd's indulgent snack and then divide this number by the cupcakes per package.\n\nWe can accomplish this by completing the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining cupcakes: Subtract the number of cupcakes eaten by Todd from the initial number of cupcakes.\n2. Divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the cupcakes per package to find the number of packages.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that determines the number of packages based on the given data. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n1. Define a rule called `cupcake_packages` that accepts the parameters for the total cupcakes and cupcakes eaten by Todd and returns the number of packages.\n2. Subtract the number of cupcakes eaten from the initial total to find the remaining cupcakes.\n3. Divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the desired cupcakes per package to determine the package count.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical unification to execute these calculations and retrieve the result.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code might look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of packages\ncupcake_packages(TotalCupcakes, EatenCupcakes, Packages) :-\n    RemainingCupcakes is TotalCupcakes - EatenCupcakes,\n    Packages is ceil(RemainingCupcakes / 8).  % Use ceil to round up in case of a remainder\n\n% Sample query to find the number of packages with given values\n?- cupcake_packages(38, 14, Packages).\n```\n\nThis code uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical reasoning to find the number of packages Sarah can make, ensuring that the result is accurately rounded up in case there are remaining cupcakes that don't divide evenly into the packages.",

        "question": "Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNancy has uploaded a total of 41 pictures to Facebook and organized them into multiple albums. Most of the pictures, 37 in number, were placed into one album, while the remaining pictures were divided across two other albums. The task is to determine the number of pictures in each of these albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of pictures in each album, we need to calculate the total count of pictures that were not placed into the first album and then divide this count by two, as these pictures were distributed equally among the two remaining albums. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pictures remaining after placing 37 pictures in the first album: `Total - Pictures in first album = 41 - 37 = 4`.\n2. Divide the number of remaining pictures by 2 to find the number of pictures in each of the two albums: `Pictures in each album = 4 / 2 = 2`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will utilize SWI-Prolog to establish a rule that computes the number of pictures in each album using the given information. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `number_of_pics` that takes the number of pictures in the first album (`PicsInAlbum1`) and calculates the number of pictures in each of the remaining albums.\n2. Subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures to find the remaining pictures.\n3. Divide the remaining pictures by 2 to determine the number of pictures in each of the two albums.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic operations and logical inference to deduce the result.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured as follows:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of pictures in each album\nnumber_of_pics(PicsInAlbum1, PicsInEachRemainingAlbum) :-\n    RemainingPics is 41 - PicsInAlbum1,\n    PicsInEachRemainingAlbum is RemainingPics / 2.\n\n% Query the rule with the known number of pictures in the first album (37)\n% ?- number_of_pics(37, PicsInEachAlbum).\n```\n\nThis code uses simple mathematical operations to distribute the remaining pictures into the two additional albums, showcasing how Prolog can be applied to solve real-world problems involving basic arithmetic.",
