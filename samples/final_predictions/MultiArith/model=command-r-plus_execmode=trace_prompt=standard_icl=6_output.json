                "content": "### Explanation:\n\nKenny earns money by mowing lawns and plans to spend his earnings on video games and books. He charges $15 for each lawn he mows. Each video game costs $45, and each book costs $5. By the end of the summer, Kenny has mowed 35 lawns and wants to buy 5 video games. We need to calculate how many books he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing the video games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of lawns mowed by the charge per lawn: 35 lawns * $15/lawn.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video games by multiplying the number of games by the cost per game: 5 games * $45/game.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the video games from the total earnings to find out how much money is left for books.\n4. Divide the remaining money by the cost per book to determine how many books Kenny can buy: Remaining money / $5/book.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing swi-prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of books Kenny can buy. The plan will involve defining a rule that calculates the total money earned, subtracts the money spent on video games, and then computes how many books can be purchased with the leftover money.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings)` where `Lawns` is the number of lawns mowed and `Earnings` is the total money earned from mowing.\n2. Define a predicate `cost_video_games(Games, Cost)` where `Games` is the number of video games purchased and `Cost` is the total cost of these games.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining)` where `Remaining` is the money left after buying video games.\n4. Define a predicate `books_purchasable(Remaining, Books)` where `Books` is the number of books Kenny can buy with the remaining money.\n5. Use swi-prolog's arithmetic capabilities and search functions to solve for the number of books by setting up the relationships and constraints defined by the predicates.\n\nThe swi-prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(Lawns, Earnings) :- Earnings is Lawns * 15.\ncost_video_games(Games, Cost) :- Cost is Games * 45.\nremaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining) :- Remaining is Earnings - Cost.\nbooks_purchasable(Remaining, Books) :- Books is Remaining // 5.\n\nkenny_books(Lawns, Games, Books) :-\n    total_earnings(Lawns, Earnings),\n    cost_video_games(Games, Cost),\n    remaining_money(Earnings, Cost, Remaining),\n    books_purchasable(Remaining, Books).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define the relationships between the variables using Prolog predicates and use integer division (`//`) for calculating the number of books, ensuring that only whole numbers of books can be bought. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in logical inference and arithmetic calculation to solve the problem efficiently."

After accumulating his earnings for four weeks, he makes two sequential purchases: first, he spends half of his total savings on a video game, and then he spends a quarter of the remaining amount on a book. The task is to determine how much money James has left after these expenditures.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following sequential calculations:\n1. Calculate James's total savings after four weeks of saving his weekly allowance: 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.\n2. Calculate the amount spent on the video game, which is half of his total savings: $40 * 0.5 = $20.\n3. Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the video game: $40 - $20 = $20.\n4. Calculate the amount spent on the book, which is a quarter of the remaining amount after the video game purchase: $20 * 0.25 = $5.\n5. Calculate the final amount left after purchasing the book: $20 - $5 = $15.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo use SWI-Prolog for solving this problem, we can define a rule that calculates the remaining amount of money after the purchases based on the given sequence of transactions. Here\u2019s how the Prolog code can be structured:\n\n1. Define a rule \"remaining_money\" that takes variables for the weekly_earnings, weeks_saved, fraction_spent_on_game, fraction_spent_on_book, and final_amount_left.\n2. Calculate total_savings by multiplying weekly_earnings by weeks_saved.\n3. Calculate money_spent_on_game by multiplying total_savings by fraction_spent_on_game.\n4. Calculate remaining_after_game by subtracting money_spent_on_game from total_savings.\n5. Calculate money_spent_on_book by multiplying remaining_after_game by fraction_spent_on_book.\n6. Calculate final_amount_left by subtracting money_spent_on_book from remaining_after_game.\n7. Define the predicates with actual values from the problem for testing the calculation.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_money(WeeklyEarnings, WeeksSaved, FractionSpentOnGame, FractionSpentOnBook, FinalAmountLeft) :-\n    TotalSavings is WeeklyEarnings * WeeksSaved,\n    MoneySpentOnGame is TotalSavings * FractionSpentOnGame,\n    RemainingAfterGame is TotalSavings - MoneySpentOnGame,\n    MoneySpentOnBook is RemainingAfterGame * FractionSpentOnBook,\n    FinalAmountLeft is RemainingAfterGame - MoneySpentOnBook.\n```\n\nThis Prolog rule effectively uses arithmetic operations to compute the remaining amount after sequential purchases, demonstrating how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving sequential operations and constraints."

Specifically, Tom's brother is currently four times as old as Tom's dog. Additionally, we know the age of Tom's brother in six years will be 30 years. We need to determine the age of Tom's dog in six years.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the current age of Tom's brother based on the information that in six years, he will be 30 years old. Therefore, his current age is 30 - 6 = 24 years.\n2. Given that Tom's brother is four times as old as Tom's dog, we can set up the equation for Tom's dog's current age as `Dog's Age = Brother's Age / 4`.\n3. Calculate Tom's dog's current age using the above relationship: `Dog's Age = 24 / 4 = 6 years`.\n4. To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we simply add 6 to the current age: `Dog's Age in 6 years = 6 + 6 = 12 years`.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the dog's age in six years based on the given relationships. Here\u2019s the structure of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `dog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears)` that takes the brother's age in six years and computes the dog's age in six years.\n2. Calculate the current age of the brother by subtracting 6 from `BrotherAgeInSixYears`.\n3. Calculate the dog's current age by dividing the brother's current age by 4.\n4. Calculate the dog's age in six years by adding 6 to the dog's current age.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's capabilities to define these calculations and relationships clearly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SWI-Prolog code outline based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the dog's age in six years\ndog_age_in_six_years(BrotherAgeInSixYears, DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    BrotherCurrentAge is BrotherAgeInSixYears - 6,\n    DogCurrentAge is BrotherCurrentAge / 4,\n    DogAgeInSixYears is DogCurrentAge + 6.\n\n% Query to find the dog's age in six years when the brother's age in six years is 30\nquery_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears) :-\n    dog_age_in_six_years(30, DogAgeInSixYears).\n```\n\nThis code defines the logical relationships and calculations needed to solve the problem. By querying `query_dog_age_in_six_years(DogAgeInSixYears)`, SWI-Prolog will compute and return the age of Tom's dog in six years based on the given conditions."

The goal is to find out the difference in total costs between the two options after considering all these factors.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, the following steps need to be taken:\n\n1. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the first apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($800) and monthly utilities ($260).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost as the product of daily miles driven (31 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the first apartment.\n\n2. **Calculate the total monthly cost for the second apartment**:\n   - Add the monthly rent ($900) and monthly utilities ($200).\n   - Calculate the monthly transportation cost using the daily miles driven (21 miles), the cost per mile (58 cents), and the number of workdays per month (20 days).\n   - Sum these costs to get the total monthly cost for the second apartment.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between the two total costs** to determine which apartment allows for greater monthly savings.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to calculate each part of the problem and then compare the results.\n\n1. **Define a predicate for calculating transportation cost**:\n   - Parameters: Miles per day, Cost per mile, Days per month.\n   - Returns: Total transportation cost.\n\n2. **Define a predicate for calculating total monthly cost**:\n   - Parameters: Rent, Utilities, Transportation cost.\n   - Returns: Total monthly cost.\n\n3. **Define a predicate to calculate the difference between the two total monthly costs**:\n   - Parameters: Total cost for the first apartment, Total cost for the second apartment.\n   - Returns: Difference in total costs.\n\n4. **Implement the predicates with actual values**:\n   - Use 800 for rent and 260 for utilities for the first apartment.\n   - Use 900 for rent and 200 for utilities for the second apartment.\n   - Use 31 miles and 21 miles for the daily transportation distances for the first and second apartments respectively.\n   - Use 58 cents as the cost per mile and 20 as the number of workdays per month.\n\n5. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference** to compute the results based on the given data.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code this way, we can efficiently compute the required values and compare the costs of the two apartments. This will allow the man to make an informed decision based on the computed cost difference."

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on similar items. Thus, to find out how much Rachel should budget, we need to calculate Sara's total expenditure and then double that amount to find Rachel's budget.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate Sara's total expenditure by adding the cost of the shoes and the dress.\n2. Double Sara's expenditure to determine Rachel's budget.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can utilize SWI-Prolog to automate the calculation of Rachel's budget based on the expenses of Sara. Here's a structured plan to create the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent)` which calculates the total amount spent by Sara. This rule will take the cost of the shoes and the dress as input and output the total spent.\n   \n2. Define a rule `budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget)` which calculates how much Rachel should budget. This rule will take the total spent by Sara as input and output the budget for Rachel by doubling Sara's expenditure.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with actual values from the problem (ShoesCost as $50 and DressCost as $200) and use them to compute the desired budget for Rachel.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query capabilities to compute `RachelBudget` based on the defined rules.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define how much Sara spent\ntotal_spent_by_sara(ShoesCost, DressCost, TotalSpent) :-\n    TotalSpent is ShoesCost + DressCost.\n\n% Define Rachel's budget as twice what Sara spent\nbudget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget) :-\n    RachelBudget is 2 * SaraSpent.\n\n% Sample query to find Rachel's budget\n% ?- total_spent_by_sara(50, 200, SaraSpent), budget_for_rachel(SaraSpent, RachelBudget).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog program uses arithmetic calculations to determine the total spent by Sara and then calculates Rachel's budget based on Sara's expenditure. The query at the end executes these calculations with the given costs of the shoes and dress, outputting the amount Rachel should budget."

He has already received commitments from half the class and is working to persuade additional voters. The task involves calculating the total number of votes Alec has secured and determining how many additional votes he needs to reach his goal.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Total Votes Required**: Alec needs three-quarters of the total class votes.\n   - Total class size = 60\n   - Required votes = 3/4 of 60 = 45 votes\n\n2. **Current Votes Secured**: Half of the class has already agreed to vote for Alec.\n   - Votes from half the class = 1/2 of 60 = 30 votes\n\n3. **Additional Votes from Undecided Students**: Out of the remaining students, only 5 were considering voting for him initially. After further campaigning, a fifth of the remaining students (who were not already considering him) decided to vote for him.\n   - Remaining students after 30 commitments = 60 - 30 = 30 students\n   - Initially undecided but considering = 5\n   - Remaining students not considering Alec initially = 30 - 5 = 25\n   - Additional votes after campaigning = 1/5 of 25 = 5 votes\n\n4. **Total Votes After Campaigning**: Sum of votes from committed and persuaded students.\n   - Total votes after initial and additional campaigning = 30 (initially committed) + 5 (initially undecided) + 5 (converted from non-considering) = 40 votes\n\n5. **Votes Needed to Reach Goal**: Subtract the total votes Alec has from the required votes.\n   - Additional votes needed = 45 (goal) - 40 (current) = 5 votes\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how many more votes Alec needs based on the input parameters. The plan involves setting up predicates for each step of the analysis and using arithmetic operations to solve for the answer.\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_students/1` to hold the total number of students.\n   - `votes_required/2` to calculate the number of votes needed to win.\n   - `initial_votes/2` to calculate the votes Alec initially secured.\n   - `undecided_votes/2` to calculate the votes from students initially undecided.\n   - `additional_campaign_votes/3` to calculate the additional votes from non-considering students after campaigning.\n   - `total_current_votes/2` to sum up all votes Alec has after campaigning.\n   - `votes_needed/3` to calculate how many more votes Alec needs to reach his goal.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the total number of students and check if the output matches the expected number of additional votes needed (5 votes).\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with clear predicates corresponding to each step of the logical analysis, we can effectively solve the problem and verify the correctness of the solution through testing with known values."

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDebby and her sister combined their Halloween candy, with Debby contributing 32 pieces and her sister adding 42 pieces to the shared collection. On the first night, they indulged in some of their treats, eating 35 pieces of candy. The goal now is to determine how many pieces of candy they have left by subtracting the number of pieces they ate from the total combined candy they started with.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the solution, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of candy pieces they started with by adding the amounts contributed by Debby and her sister: 32 + 42 = 74 pieces.\n2. Determine the number of candy pieces they have left by subtracting the number of pieces they ate from the total: 74 - 35 = 39 pieces.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the remaining number of candy pieces based on the initial amounts and the number of pieces they ate. Here's a structured plan for the code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_candy_total(DebbyCandy, SisterCandy, TotalCandy)` that calculates the total number of candy pieces they combined. It takes the number of candy pieces Debby and her sister have as input and returns the total combined candy.\n\n2. Define another predicate `candy_left(TotalCandy, AtePieces, RemainingCandy)` that calculates the number of candy pieces they have left. It takes the total combined candy and the number of pieces they ate as input and returns the remaining amount.\n\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values: `initial_candy_total(32, 42, TotalCandy)`, `candy_left(TotalCandy, 35, RemainingCandy)`.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and find the value of `RemainingCandy`.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the initial total candy\ninitial_candy_total(DebbyCandy, SisterCandy, TotalCandy) :-\n    TotalCandy is DebbyCandy + SisterCandy.\n\n% Calculate the candy left after eating some\ncandy_left(TotalCandy, AtePieces, RemainingCandy) :-\n    RemainingCandy is TotalCandy - AtePieces.\n\n% Sample query to find the remaining candy\n% ?- initial_candy_total(32, 42, TotalCandy), candy_left(TotalCandy, 35, RemainingCandy).\n```\n\nThis code defines rules to calculate the initial total candy and the candy left after eating some.

Specifically, he needs to wash 39 short-sleeve shirts and 47 long-sleeve shirts. However, by the time school begins, he has only managed to wash 20 shirts. To determine his progress, we need to calculate how many shirts he has left to wash, or, in other words, how many shirts he did not wash.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nAmy had a collection of music and video files on her flash drive. Initially, she had 4 music files and 21 video files, making a total of 25 files. She then deleted some files, specifically 23 files. The problem asks us to determine how many files remain on her flash drive after this deletion.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of files remaining on Amy's flash drive, we need to subtract the number of deleted files from the initial total count of files. This can be outlined in the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of files: 4 music files and 21 video files, totaling 25 files.\n2. Recognize the number of deleted files: 23 files.\n3. Apply subtraction to find the number of remaining files: Total initial files - Deleted files = Remaining files.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to represent the initial file counts, deleted files, and the calculation of remaining files.

However, misfortune strikes as not all the games function as expected\u201419 of them turn out to be faulty or incompatible with his system. The question now is, how many good, playable games does Ned have left in his newly expanded collection?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo unravel this puzzle, we need to perform a series of calculations:\n\n1. **Total Game Collection**: Ned starts his journey with a bang, acquiring a total of 11 + 22 = 33 games.\n2. **Faulty Games**: Misfortune strikes, and 19 of these games are deemed faulty, leaving him with fewer playable options.\n3. **Playable Games**: To find the number of good games, we subtract the faulty games from the total collection: 33 - 19 = 14.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo automate this calculation using SWI-Prolog, we can design a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `total_games(BoughtFromFriend, BoughtAtGarageSale, TotalGames)` calculates the total number of games Ned acquired.\n   - `faulty_games(TotalGames, FaultyGames)` determines how many games turned out to be faulty.\n   - `good_games(TotalGames, FaultyGames, GoodGames)` computes the number of good, playable games Ned ended up with.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Utilize arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform the necessary calculations.\n   - Define rules and relationships between the predicates to capture the problem's logic.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Instantiate the predicates with the given values: `BoughtFromFriend` as 11, `BoughtAtGarageSale` as 22, and `FaultyGames` as 19.\n   - Query the `good_games/3` predicate to obtain the number of good games Ned has.\n\nBy following this plan, we can create a concise SWI-Prolog program that computes the number of good games Ned is left with after his shopping spree and subsequent discovery of faulty games.",

This involves calculating the difference between the total pastries she brought and the number of pastries she had remaining.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many pastries Katie sold, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the given information: Katie baked a certain number of cupcakes and cookies.\n2. Identify the unknown: We need to find out the number of pastries sold.\n3. Set up the equation: Let 'X' be the number of pastries sold. The total pastries brought can be calculated as the sum of cupcakes and cookies. The number of pastries remaining is given.\n4. Formulate the equation: The number of pastries sold can be calculated as: \n   - Total pastries brought - Remaining pastries = Number of pastries sold \n   - Or, mathematically: Cupcakes + Cookies - Remaining = Sold\n5. Solve for 'X' to find the number of pastries sold.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define predicates:\n   - `cupcakes(NumCupcakes)` to represent the number of cupcakes Katie baked.\n   - `cookies(NumCookies)` to represent the number of cookies she baked.\n   - `remaining_pastries(NumRemaining)` to represent the number of pastries she had remaining after the sale.\n2. Create a rule `sold_pastries(NumCupcakes, NumCookies, NumRemaining, NumSold)` to calculate the number of pastries sold:\n   - The rule will calculate the total pastries brought by summing the number of cupcakes and cookies.\n   - It will then subtract the number of remaining pastries to find the number of pastries sold.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations:\n   - `TotalBrought is NumCupcakes + NumCookies.`\n   - `NumSold is TotalBrought - NumRemaining.`\n4. Query the predicate with the given values to find the number of pastries sold:\n   - `?- sold_pastries(7, 5, 8, NumSold).`\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using Prolog's arithmetic and logical inference capabilities. It demonstrates how Prolog can be used to model and solve basic mathematical problems.",

        "question": "Zoe bought two coloring books. One had 44 pictures and the other had 44. After one week she had already colored 20 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nZoe bought two coloring books, each containing 44 pictures. After a week, she has colored some pictures, and we need to determine how many pictures are left for her to color. To find the answer, we need to calculate the total number of pictures in both books, subtract the number of pictures she has already colored, and then determine the remaining count.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved through the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures in both coloring books: 44 pictures in one book, and 44 pictures in the other book.\n2. Sum these counts to find the total number of pictures initially available: 44 + 44 = 88.\n3. Zoe has colored 20 pictures in the first week.\n4. To find out how many pictures are left to color, subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total: 88 - 20 = 68.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the remaining pictures Zoe has to color. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `remaining_pictures` that takes three parameters: the number of pictures in one book (`PicturesBook1`), the number of pictures in the other book (`PicturesBook2`), and the number of pictures Zoe has already colored (`ColoredPictures`).\n2. Calculate the total number of pictures in both books by summing `PicturesBook1` and `PicturesBook2`.\n3. Compute the remaining pictures by subtracting `ColoredPictures` from the total number of pictures.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate remaining pictures\nremaining_pictures(PicturesBook1, PicturesBook2, ColoredPictures, RemainingPictures) :-\n    total_pictures(PicturesBook1, PicturesBook2, TotalPictures),\n    RemainingPictures is TotalPictures - ColoredPictures.\n\n% Define a rule to calculate the total number of pictures\ntotal_pictures(Pictures1, Pictures2, TotalPictures) :-\n    TotalPictures is Pictures1 + Pictures2.\n\n% Example query to calculate remaining pictures\n% ?- remaining_pictures(44, 44, 20, RemainingPictures).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the remaining pictures Zoe has to color using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference.

This problem involves basic arithmetic operations and logical reasoning to find the number of bad carrots based on the given information.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Faye picked 23 carrots.\n2. Her mother picked 5 carrots.\n3. Altogether, they picked 23 + 5 = 28 carrots.\n4. Out of these 28 carrots, only 12 were good.\n5. To find the number of bad carrots, we subtract the good carrots from the total: 28 - 12 = 16.\n\nSo, they had 16 bad carrots.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo create a SWI-Prolog code for this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

They then proceeded to enjoy some of their treats, eating 4 pieces on the first night. The task is to calculate how many pieces of candy they have left after this initial indulgence.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of candy pieces they have left, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSam bought a total of 13 adventure books and 17 mystery books at the school's book fair, and we know that 15 of these books were used. The task is to determine how many of the books he bought are new. This problem involves categorizing the books into two groups - used and new - and finding the count for the new books.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nGiven:\n- Total number of adventure books = 13\n- Total number of mystery books = 17\n- Total number of used books = 15\n\nTo Find:\n- Number of new books = ?\n\nSolution:\nThe problem can be solved by categorizing the books as follows:\n1. Calculate the total number of books bought:\n   - Total books = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books\n2. Since we know the total number of used books, we can find the number of new books:\n   - Number of new books = Total books - Number of used books\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the total number of books and then determine the number of new books based on the given information. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_books(Adventure, Mystery, Total)` that calculates the sum of adventure and mystery books:\n   ```prolog\n   total_books(Adventure, Mystery, Total) :- Total is Adventure + Mystery.\n   ```\n2.

Calculate the total number of carrots picked: 17 (picked by Vanessa) + 14 (picked by her mom) = 31.\n2. Identify the number of bad carrots by subtracting the good carrots from the total: 31 (total picked) - 24 (good carrots) = 7.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of bad carrots based on the input values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `bad_carrots/3` that takes three parameters: `vanessa_picked`, `mom_picked`, and `bad_carrots`.\n2. Calculate the total number of carrots picked by summing `vanessa_picked` and `mom_picked`.\n3. Calculate the number of bad carrots by subtracting the good carrots (24) from the total picked.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n5. Test the rule by querying with the given values: `bad_carrots(17, 14, BadCarrots).`\n\nHere's how the Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\nbad_carrots(VanessaPicked, MomPicked, BadCarrots) :-\n    TotalPicked is VanessaPicked + MomPicked,\n    BadCarrots is TotalPicked - 24.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of bad carrots by subtracting the known good carrots from the total picked, showcasing the use of Prolog for solving basic arithmetic problems through logical inference.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nOlivia and her mom went carrot picking in their garden and collected a total of 34 carrots, with Olivia picking 20 and her mother picking 14. However, out of their harvest, only 19 carrots turned out to be good. The task is to determine how many bad carrots they ended up with.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of bad carrots, we can perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of carrots picked: Olivia's carrots + Mother's carrots = 20 + 14 = 34.\n2. Compare the total picked carrots with the good carrots: 34 (total picked) - 19 (good carrots) = 15.\n3. Interpret the result: The difference of 15 represents the number of bad carrots they had.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"bad_carrots\" that takes the number of carrots picked by Olivia, the number picked by her mother, the total good carrots, and the variable for the number of bad carrots as parameters.\n2. Calculate the total number of carrots picked by summing Olivia's and her mother's contributions.\n3. Compute the number of bad carrots by subtracting the good carrots from the total picked.\n4.

        "question": "While shopping, Maria bought 35 green towels and 21 white towels. If she gave her mother 34 of them, how many towels did Maria end up with?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMaria went shopping and purchased a total of 56 towels, consisting of 35 green towels and 21 white towels. She then gave 34 of these towels to her mother. The problem is to determine how many towels Maria has left after giving some to her mother.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many towels Maria ended up with, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of towels Maria bought: 35 green towels + 21 white towels = 56 towels.\n2. Subtract the number of towels she gave to her mother from the total number of towels: 56 towels - 34 towels = 22 towels.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the final number of towels Maria has left based on the given inputs. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Define a rule named `towels_left` that takes three parameters: the number of green towels bought (`Green`), the number of white towels bought (`White`), and the number of towels given to her mother (`Gave`).\n2. Calculate the total number of towels bought (`TotalBought`) by summing up the green and white towels: `TotalBought is Green + White`.\n3. Calculate the number of towels Maria has left (`Left`) by subtracting the number of towels she gave from the total bought: `Left is TotalBought - Gave`.\n4. Implement the rule using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n```prolog\ntowels_left(Green, White, Gave, Left) :-\n    TotalBought is Green + White,\n    Left is TotalBought - Gave.\n```\n5. Test the rule with the given values:\n```prolog\n?- towels_left(35, 21, 34, Left).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a clear relationship between the number of towels bought, the number given away, and the number left. It showcases how Prolog can be used to model and solve basic arithmetic problems through logical inference and relationships between variables.",

We are given the total number of girls and boys trying out and the number of students who got called back.

        "question": "Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to make flower bouquets. If she only used 81 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Bianca pick?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nBianca picked a certain number of tulips and roses to create flower bouquets. However, she ended up using fewer flowers than she initially picked. To find out how many extra flowers she picked, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of flowers she picked and the number of flowers she actually used.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers Bianca picked:\n   - Tulips picked: 39\n   - Roses picked: 49\n   - Total flowers picked = Tulips + Roses\n\n2. Compare the total flowers picked with the number of flowers used:\n   - Flowers used: 81\n\n3. Calculate the difference between the total flowers picked and the flowers used to find the extra flowers:\n   - Extra flowers = Total flowers picked - Flowers used\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the extra flowers Bianca picked. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `extra_flowers(TotalPicked, Used, Extra)` that computes the extra flowers based on the total picked and the number used.\n2.

Initially, the store had a certain number of Siamese cats and house cats. During the sale, some cats were sold, and now we need to determine how many cats are left in the store.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of cats left, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Understand the initial state**: We are given that the pet store initially had 15 Siamese cats and 49 house cats, making a total of 15 + 49 = 64 cats.\n2. **Consider the change**: During the sale, 19 cats were sold.

        "question": "A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the number of customers who left a tip for the waiter at \"The Greasy Spoon\" restaurant. Initially, the waiter had 39 customers, and during the lunch rush, 12 more customers were added. However, out of the total 39 + 12 = 51 customers, 49 did not leave a tip. The task is to determine how many customers did provide a tip.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of customers who left a tip, we can subtract the number of customers who did not leave a tip from the total number of customers. This can be calculated as:\n\nTotal customers - Customers with no tip = Customers with a tip\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n51 - 49 = 2\n\nSo, 2 customers left a tip for the waiter.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo express this problem in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of customers who left a tip based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `customers_with_tip(TotalCustomers, NoTipCustomers, TipCustomers)` that relates the total number of customers, the number of customers who did not leave a tip, and the number of customers who left a tip.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculation: `TipCustomers is TotalCustomers - NoTipCustomers`.\n3. Instantiate the rule with the given values: `TotalCustomers` is the sum of initial customers (39) and additional customers (12), and `NoTipCustomers` is 49.\n4. Query the rule to find `TipCustomers`, which represents the number of customers who left a tip.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the number of customers who left a tip\ncustomers_with_tip(TotalCustomers, NoTipCustomers, TipCustomers) :-\n    TipCustomers is TotalCustomers - NoTipCustomers.\n\n% Query the rule to find the number of customers who left a tip\nquery_tip_customers(TipCustomers) :-\n    TotalCustomers is 39 + 12,\n    NoTipCustomers is 49,\n    customers_with_tip(TotalCustomers, NoTipCustomers, TipCustomers).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationship between the total customers, those who didn't leave a tip, and those who did.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWendy baked a total of 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies for the school bake sale. However, after the sale, she was left with 32 unsold items that she had to take back home. The problem is to calculate how many pastries, including both cupcakes and cookies, she sold during the bake sale.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of pastries Wendy sold, we need to consider the initial count of each type of pastry and the number of unsold pastries she had left. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Wendy baked 41 cupcakes and 31 cookies, so the total initial count of pastries is 41 + 31 = 72 pastries.\n2. **Unsold Count**: After the sale, Wendy had 32 unsold pastries left.\n3. **Pastries Sold**: To find out how many pastries Wendy sold, we subtract the number of unsold pastries from the initial count: Initial Count - Unsold Count = Pastries Sold.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a predicate that calculates the number of pastries sold based on the initial count of cupcakes and cookies and the number of unsold pastries.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe school cafeteria ordered a total of 25 red apples and 17 green apples, but only 10 students wanted fruit. To determine how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of apples ordered and the number of apples wanted by students.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of extra apples, we can perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples ordered: 25 red apples + 17 green apples.\n2. Determine the number of apples wanted by students: 10 students * 1 apple per student (assuming each student wants one apple).\n3. Find the difference between the total apples ordered and the apples wanted to determine the excess.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of extra apples. Our plan will involve creating predicates for each step of the analysis:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_ordered(Red, Green, TotalApples)` that calculates the sum of red and green apples ordered.\n2. Define a predicate `apples_wanted(Students, ApplesWanted)` that computes the number of apples wanted by students (assuming each student wants one apple).\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJerry had a fun time at the arcade, playing two games: 'whack-a-mole' and 'skeeball'. He won a certain number of tickets from each game and now wants to know how many tickets he has left after spending some on a hat. To find the answer, we need to calculate the total number of tickets he won and then subtract the number of tickets he spent.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves basic arithmetic operations to determine the final number of tickets Jerry has in his possession:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets won by adding up the tickets from 'whack-a-mole' and 'skeeball': 29 tickets + 17 tickets = 46 tickets.\n2. Subtract the number of tickets Jerry spent on the hat (12 tickets) from the total tickets won (46 tickets) to find out how many he has left: 46 tickets - 12 tickets = 34 tickets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a simple rule that calculates the remaining tickets based on the given inputs:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_tickets(TicketsWon, TicketsSpent, TicketsLeft)` to relate the number of tickets won, the number of tickets spent, and the final number of tickets left.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the addition and subtraction operations within the predicate.\n3.

Then, we create a specific rule `jerrys_tickets_left/1` to find out how many tickets Jerry has left by providing the total tickets won (46) and the tickets spent on the hat (12).

Faye initially had 47 pieces of candy, then she consumed 25 pieces, and her sister gave her 40 more.

        "question": "Kaleb had 34 books. If he sold 17 of them and used the money he earned to buy 7 new books, how many books would Kaleb have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKaleb initially possesses 34 books and embarks on a journey of selling and buying books. He sells half of his collection, earning money in the process. With this money, he then purchases seven new books. The problem requires us to determine the net change in Kaleb's book collection and, ultimately, the total number of books he possesses at the end of this transaction.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of books sold**: We know that Kaleb sold half of his initial collection of 34 books. So, the number of books sold is 17.\n2. **Determine the number of books Kaleb has after selling**: After selling half of his books, Kaleb's collection decreases by half. So, he now has 17 remaining books from his initial collection.\n3. **Calculate the number of books bought**: Kaleb uses the money earned from selling books to buy new ones. He buys 7 books.\n4. **Find the total number of books Kaleb has now**: To determine Kaleb's current book count, we add the number of books he has left after selling (17) to the number of new books he bought (7).\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create a straightforward rule that calculates the final number of books Kaleb has by considering the number he started with, the proportion he sold, and the number of new books he bought:\n\n1. **Define a predicate `initial_books(Books)`** to represent the number of books Kaleb has at the beginning.\n2. **Define a predicate `sold_books(InitialBooks, SoldBooks)`** to calculate the number of books Kaleb sells, given his initial collection. This can be computed as `SoldBooks is InitialBooks // 2`.\n3. **Define a predicate `bought_books(NumBought, BoughtBooks)`** to represent the number of new books Kaleb buys.\n4. **Define a predicate `final_book_count(InitialBooks, NumSold, NumBought, FinalCount)`** to calculate the total number of books Kaleb has at the end. This is derived by subtracting the number of sold books from the initial count and then adding the number of new books bought.\n5. **Implement the predicates and test the solution**:\n   - Use `initial_books(34)` to represent Kaleb's initial collection.\n   - Compute `sold_books(InitialBooks, SoldBooks)` to find out how many books he sold.\n   - Use `bought_books(7, BoughtBooks)` to represent the new books he bought.\n   - Finally, query `final_book_count(InitialBooks, SoldBooks, BoughtBooks, FinalCount)` to find out how many books Kaleb has now, and compare the result with the expected answer.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_books(34).\n\nsold_books(InitialBooks, SoldBooks) :- SoldBooks is InitialBooks // 2.\n\nbought_books(7, Bought).\n\nfinal_book_count(Initial, Sold, Bought, Final) :-\n    sold_books(Initial, Sold),\n    Final is Initial - Sold + Bought.\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the final number of books Kaleb has, allowing us to logically compute the result using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.",

The goal is to determine the final count of customers the waiter has after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Initial State**: Start with the given number of customers, which is 19.\n2. **Departure of Customers**: Subtract the number of customers who left (14) from the initial count.\n3. **Arrival of New Customers**: Add the number of new customers (36) to the count after the departure.\n4. **Final State**: The final count of customers is the result of the additions and subtractions.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates to track the changes in customer count and compute the final number of customers:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_customers(Count)` to represent the starting number of customers (19).\n   - `customers_left(LeftCount, InitialCount)` to calculate the count after some customers left, where `LeftCount` is the updated count and `InitialCount` is the starting count.\n   - `new_customers_arrived(NewCount, AfterLeftCount)` to calculate the count after new customers arrive, where `NewCount` is the updated count and `AfterLeftCount` is the count after some customers left.\n   - `final_customers(FinalCount)` to represent the final count of customers the waiter has.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use facts and rules to define each predicate based on the analysis above.\n   - Use arithmetic operations within predicates to perform calculations: `-` for customers leaving and `+` for new customers arriving.\n   - Chain predicates to derive the final answer, using the relationships defined in the analysis.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the initial customer count and the counts of customers leaving and arriving to ensure the output matches the expected final customer count.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code with these predicates, we can accurately model the changes in customer count and compute the final result using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.",

The problem requires us to calculate the final number of songs on her MP3 player after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the impact of each action on the number of songs:\n\n1. Deleting 9 old songs: This will reduce the total number of songs by 9.\n2. Adding 8 new songs: This will increase the total number of songs by 8.\n\nTo find the final count, we need to apply these changes sequentially: starting from the initial count of 11 songs, subtract the deleted songs, and then add the new songs.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to model these sequential changes and calculate the final count of songs. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_songs(Count)` to represent the initial number of songs Paige had.\n2.

Add the number of new songs (50) to the count of songs left after deletion to determine the final count.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to perform these two calculations sequentially: the subtraction of deleted songs and the addition of new songs. We will define predicates to handle these operations and then query them to find the final count.\n\n1. Define a predicate `songs_after_deletion(InitialSongs, DeletedSongs, RemainingSongs)` that calculates the number of songs left after deleting old songs:\n   ```prolog\n   songs_after_deletion(InitialSongs, DeletedSongs, RemainingSongs) :-\n       RemainingSongs is InitialSongs - DeletedSongs.\n   ```\n2. Define a predicate `final_song_count(RemainingSongs, NewSongsAdded, TotalSongs)` that calculates the total number of songs after adding the new songs:\n   ```prolog\n   final_song_count(RemainingSongs, NewSongsAdded, TotalSongs) :-\n       TotalSongs is RemainingSongs + NewSongsAdded.\n   ```\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and logical inference to ensure the correct flow of data.\n4. Query the predicates with the given values to find the final count of songs:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- songs_after_deletion(15, 8, Remaining), final_song_count(Remaining, 50, TotalSongs).\n   ```\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using Prolog's arithmetic and inference capabilities. It demonstrates how Prolog can be used to model and solve basic arithmetic problems.",

Initially, the bin contains 31 oranges. Then, 9 old oranges are thrown away, and subsequently, 38 new oranges are added to the bin. The task is to determine the final count of oranges in the bin after these two changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of oranges in the bin after these changes, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. **Initial count**: Start with the initial count of 31 oranges.\n2. **Throwing away old oranges**: Subtract the number of old oranges thrown away (9) from the initial count.\n3. **Adding new oranges**: Add the number of new oranges (38) to the remaining count after throwing away old ones.\n4. **Final count**: The result of the addition in step 3 gives the final count of oranges in the bin.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to perform these sequential calculations and determine the final count of oranges in the bin.

He sells a portion of his books and then uses the proceeds to buy new ones, ultimately altering the number of books in his collection. The problem requires us to compute the final count of books Adam ends up with after these transactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Adam starts with 33 books.\n2. He sells 11 of his books, reducing his collection.\n3. Adam uses the money earned from selling books to buy new ones. The number of new books he can buy depends on the price at which he sells each book and the price he pays for each new book.\n4. Calculate the final count of books by subtracting the number of books sold from the initial count and then adding the number of new books bought.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can outline the following plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_books(Count)` to represent the number of books Adam has initially.\n2. Define another predicate `sold_books(Count, SoldCount)` to calculate the number of books Adam sells, where `Count` is the initial count, and `SoldCount` is the number of books sold.\n3. Create a predicate `bought_books(SoldPrice, BuyPrice, SoldCount, NewCount)` to compute the number of new books Adam can buy. `SoldPrice` represents the price at which he sells each book, `BuyPrice` is the price he pays for each new book, `SoldCount` is the number of books sold, and `NewCount` is the number of new books he can buy.\n4. Finally, define a predicate `final_books(InitialCount, SoldCount, NewCount, FinalCount)` to calculate the final count of books Adam has. `InitialCount` is the starting number of books, `SoldCount` is the number sold, `NewCount` is the number of new books bought, and `FinalCount` is the resulting count of books.\n5.

To determine the final count of roses, we need to consider these changes in inventory.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves keeping track of the florist's rose inventory through a series of transactions:\n\n1. Initial state: The florist had 6 roses.\n2. Sale: She sold 5 roses, reducing her inventory.\n3. Acquisition: The florist then picked 12 more roses, increasing her inventory.\n\nTo find out the final count of roses, we need to calculate the net change in inventory by considering both the sale and the subsequent acquisition of roses.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the final number of roses the florist has. The plan involves defining predicates for the initial inventory, sale, acquisition, and final count.\n\n1.

The problem involves determining the total number of cupcakes she has after these actions.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many cupcakes Carol has in total, we need to consider the following steps:\n1. Start with the initial number of cupcakes Carol made, which is 19.\n2. Subtract the number of cupcakes she sold, which is 6.\n3. Add the number of additional cupcakes she made, which is 27.\n4. The final sum will give us the total number of cupcakes Carol has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of cupcakes Carol has by considering the initial number of cupcakes, the number sold, and the additional cupcakes made. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Define a rule \"total_cupcakes(Initial, Sold, Additional, Total)\":\n   - \"Initial\" represents the initial number of cupcakes Carol made.\n   - \"Sold\" is the number of cupcakes she sold.\n   - \"Additional\" is the number of extra cupcakes she made.\n   - \"Total\" is the final count of cupcakes she has.\n2.

Query the rule to find the \"Total\" number of cupcakes Carol has.\n\nBy following this plan, we can construct a SWI-Prolog code that computes the total number of cupcakes Carol has after selling and making additional ones.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily initially had a certain number of coloring books and then underwent a series of transactions involving giving away and buying more books. The problem requires tracking these changes to determine the final count of coloring books she has.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many coloring books Emily has in total, we need to consider the initial count, the number given away, and the additional books bought. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Emily started with 7 coloring books.\n2. She gave away 2 coloring books, reducing her count.\n3. Subsequently, she bought 14 new coloring books, increasing her collection.\n4. To find the total number of coloring books she has now, we sum the initial count and the additional books bought, and then subtract the number of books she gave away.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the total number of coloring books Emily has after these transactions. Our plan will involve defining predicates to handle each step of the analysis:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_books(Count)` to represent the number of coloring books Emily had initially.\n2. Define a predicate `gave_away_books(GaveAway, Remaining)` to calculate the number of books remaining after giving some away.\n3. Define a predicate `bought_books(Bought, Total)` to calculate the total number of books after buying a certain quantity.\n4. Combine these predicates to calculate the final count of coloring books Emily has.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n6.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJanet is playing a video game and her number of lives fluctuates throughout the game. Initially, she has 47 lives.

The task is to determine her final number of lives after these changes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many lives Janet has at the end, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1.

Set `InitialCount` to 8 to represent the starting student count.\n3. Calculate the intermediate count after students left using `LeftCount - InitialCount`.\n4. Add the `NewCount` to the intermediate count to get the `FinalCount`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\nfinal_student_count(InitialCount, LeftCount, NewCount, FinalCount) :-\n    IntermediateCount is InitialCount - LeftCount,\n    FinalCount is IntermediateCount + NewCount.\n\n% Query to find the final student count\nfourth_grade_students(FinalCount) :-\n    final_student_count(8, 5, 8, FinalCount).\n```\n\nIn this code, we define the `final_student_count` predicate to calculate the final student count based on the initial count, the number of students who left, and the number of new students. The `fourth_grade_students` predicate is then used to query the final student count with the given values from the problem. This approach leverages Prolog's logical inference and arithmetic capabilities to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFrank initially had $11, and he spent $3 on a new game. To find out how much money he has now, we need to add his initial amount and the allowance he received ($14) and then subtract the amount he spent on the game. This will give us his current total.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating Frank's current amount of money by considering his initial balance, the money he spent, and the additional allowance he received. Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount of money Frank had: $11.\n2. Identify the amount he spent on the game: $3.\n3. Calculate the total allowance he received: $14.\n4. To find out how much money Frank has now, add his initial amount and the allowance he received, then subtract the amount he spent on the game: \n   - New total = Initial amount + Allowance received - Amount spent\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_amount(Amount)` to represent the money Frank had initially.\n2. Define a predicate `spent_on_game(AmountSpent)` to represent the money Frank spent on the game.\n3. Define a predicate `allowance_received(Allowance)` to represent the additional money Frank received as allowance.\n4. Define a predicate `current_amount(CurrentAmount)` to calculate and represent Frank's current amount of money.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - Subtract `AmountSpent` from the sum of `InitialAmount` and `Allowance`.\n6. Test the predicates by querying them with the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define initial amount\ninitial_amount(11).\n\n% Define amount spent on the game\nspent_on_game(3).\n\n% Define allowance received\nallowance_received(14).\n\n% Calculate current amount\ncurrent_amount(CurrentAmount) :-\n    initial_amount(Initial),\n    allowance_received(Allowance),\n    spent_on_game(Spent),\n    CurrentAmount is Initial + Allowance - Spent.\n```\n\nThis code sets up the initial conditions, defines the amounts spent and received, and then calculates Frank's current amount of money.

Initial state: Zoe has 6 songs.\n2. Deletion: She deletes 3 old songs, reducing the count by 3.\n3. Addition: She then adds 20 new songs, increasing the count by 20.\n\nTo get the final count, we need to subtract the deleted songs from the initial count and then add the new songs.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the final number of songs based on the initial count, the number of deleted songs, and the number of added songs.

She then experiences two events that impact the number of roses she possesses: she sells three roses, and subsequently, she picks thirty-four more roses. To determine the final count of roses the florist has, we need to account for these changes in her inventory.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the initial state and the two events that alter the number of roses:\n\n1. Initial state: The florist has 5 roses.\n2. Event 1: She sells 3 roses, decreasing her inventory.\n3. Event 2: She picks 34 more roses, increasing her inventory.\n\nTo find the final count, we need to subtract the number of roses sold from the initial count and then add the number of roses picked.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the final number of roses the florist has by considering the initial count and the two events. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `final_rose_count` that takes into account the initial number of roses, the number of roses sold, the additional roses picked, and calculates the final count.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations: subtract the number of roses sold from the initial count and then add the number of additional roses picked.\n3. The rule will unify the result with the final count of roses.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final rose count\nfinal_rose_count(InitialRoses, RosesSold, AdditionalRosesPicked, FinalCount) :-\n    InitialSoldCount is InitialRoses - RosesSold,\n    FinalCount is InitialSoldCount + AdditionalRosesPicked.\n\n% Example query to find the final rose count\n% ?- final_rose_count(5, 3, 34, FinalCount).\n% This query should output the final rose count.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the final number of roses the florist has by considering the initial count and the impact of selling and picking roses.

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define a predicate**: Create a predicate called `total_spent(NumberOfFlowers, PricePerFlower, TotalAmount)` to calculate the total amount spent.\n2. **Calculate the total amount**: Multiply the `NumberOfFlowers` by the `PricePerFlower` to get the `TotalAmount`.\n3. **Use arithmetic operations**: Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication and calculate the result.\n4. **Test the predicate**: Input the values for the number of roses, the number of daisies, and the price per flower to calculate the total amount spent.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate total amount spent\ntotal_spent(NumberOfFlowers, PricePerFlower, TotalAmount) :-\n    TotalAmount is NumberOfFlowers * PricePerFlower.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total amount spent\n% How much did Emily spend on roses?\n% - Number of roses: 2\n% - Price per rose: $3\n% - Query: total_spent(2, 3, TotalRosesSpent).\n% Expected output: TotalRosesSpent = 6\n\n% How much did Emily spend on daisies?\n% - Number of daisies: 2\n% - Price per daisy: $3\n% - Query: total_spent(2, 3, TotalDaisiesSpent).\n% Expected output: TotalDaisiesSpent = 6\n\n% Total amount Emily spent on flowers\n% - Total number of flowers: 4\n% - Query: total_spent(4, 3, TotalSpent).\n% Expected output: TotalSpent = 12\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a simple rule to calculate the total amount spent based on the number of flowers and the price per flower. By using arithmetic operations and querying the predicate with different inputs, we can find out how much Emily spent on roses, daisies, and flowers overall.",

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `books_per_shelf(NumBooks, TotalShelfBooks)` to calculate the total number of books on one shelf.\n   - `mystery_books(NumShelves, BooksPerShelf, TotalMysteryBooks)` to calculate the total number of mystery books.\n   - `picture_books(NumShelves, BooksPerShelf, TotalPictureBooks)` to calculate the total number of picture books.\n   - `total_books(TotalMystery, TotalPicture, GrandTotal)` to calculate the overall total of books.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.\n   - For `books_per_shelf`, multiply `NumBooks` by 9 to get the total number of books per shelf.\n   - For `mystery_books` and `picture_books`, multiply the number of shelves by the books per shelf to get the respective totals.\n   - In `total_books`, sum the totals of mystery and picture books to find the grand total.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the number of shelves for each category and check if the output matches the expected total.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate total books on one shelf\nbooks_per_shelf(NumBooks, TotalShelfBooks) :- TotalShelfBooks is NumBooks * 9.\n\n% Calculate total mystery books\nmystery_books(NumShelves, BooksPerShelf, TotalMysteryBooks) :- TotalMysteryBooks is NumShelves * BooksPerShelf.\n\n% Calculate total picture books\npicture_books(NumShelves, BooksPerShelf, TotalPictureBooks) :- TotalPictureBooks is NumShelves * BooksPerShelf.\n\n% Calculate the grand total of books\ntotal_books(TotalMystery, TotalPicture, GrandTotal) :- GrandTotal is TotalMystery + TotalPicture.\n\n% Example query\n% ?- total_books(6, 2, GrandTotal).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total number of books Rachel has by considering the number of shelves for each category and the constant number of books per shelf, demonstrating the use of logical inference and arithmetic operations in Prolog.",

        "question": "Rachel was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 7 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 3 scarves and 4 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Rachel have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRachel is unboxing her winter clothes, and she wants to know the total number of clothing items she has. In each of the 7 boxes, she finds a set of scarves and mittens, specifically 3 scarves and 4 mittens per box. The task is to calculate the total quantity of scarves and mittens she possesses.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of clothing items, we need to consider the quantities of scarves and mittens in each box and then multiply those quantities by the total number of boxes. This can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. **Quantity of Scarves**: There are 3 scarves in each box. To find the total number of scarves, we multiply the quantity per box by the total number of boxes: 3 scarves/box * 7 boxes = 21 scarves.\n\n2. **Quantity of Mittens**: There are 4 mittens in each box. Similarly, to find the total number of mittens, we multiply the quantity per box by the total number of boxes: 4 mittens/box * 7 boxes = 28 mittens.\n\n3. **Total Clothing Items**: To get the grand total of clothing items, we sum up the totals for scarves and mittens: Total = Scarves + Mittens = 21 + 28 = 49 items.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total number of clothing items based on the given quantities and the number of boxes. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate `total_clothing(NumBoxes, ItemsPerBox, TotalItems)` to calculate the total number of clothing items. Here, `NumBoxes` is the number of boxes, `ItemsPerBox` is a list representing the quantities of scarves and mittens per box, and `TotalItems` is the final count of clothing items.\n\n2. **Calculate Scarves and Mittens**:\n   - Within the `total_clothing` predicate, calculate the total number of scarves by multiplying the number of boxes by the quantity of scarves per box.\n   - Similarly, calculate the total number of mittens by multiplying the number of boxes by the quantity of mittens per box.\n\n3. **Sum Up Total Items**:\n   - Add up the totals for scarves and mittens to find the `TotalItems`.\n\n4. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the number of boxes and the quantities of scarves and mittens per box to verify that the output matches the expected total of 49 clothing items.\n\nHere's a representation of the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating total clothing items\ntotal_clothing(NumBoxes, ItemsPerBox, TotalItems) :-\n    scarves(NumBoxes, ItemsPerBox, ScarvesTotal),\n    mittens(NumBoxes, ItemsPerBox, MittensTotal),\n    TotalItems is ScarvesTotal + MittensTotal.\n\n% Calculate total scarves\nscarves(NumBoxes, ItemsPerBox, ScarvesTotal) :-\n    ScarvesPerBox is nth0(Scarves, ItemsPerBox, 0),\n    ScarvesTotal is ScarvesPerBox * NumBoxes.\n\n% Calculate total mittens\nmittens(NumBoxes, ItemsPerBox, MittensTotal) :-\n    MittensPerBox is nth1(Mittens, ItemsPerBox, 0),\n    MittensTotal is MittensPerBox * NumBoxes.\n\n% Example query to calculate total clothing items\n% ?- total_clothing(7, [3, 4], TotalItems).\n% This should output TotalItems as 49.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total number of clothing items Rachel has by considering the quantities in each box and the total number of boxes, demonstrating the use of Prolog for solving practical counting problems.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe pet store has multiple bird cages, each containing a fixed number of parrots and parakeets. The problem involves calculating the total number of birds in the store by considering the number of cages and the number of birds in each cage.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. **Total number of parrots**: Multiply the number of cages by the number of parrots in each cage.\n2. **Total number of parakeets**: Multiply the number of cages by the number of parakeets in each cage.\n3. **Total number of birds**: Sum the total number of parrots and the total number of parakeets.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the total number of birds in the pet store.

Define a predicate `total_birds(NumCages, BirdsPerCage, TotalBirds)` that relates the number of cages, the number of birds per cage, and the total number of birds.\n2. Within the `total_birds` predicate, use arithmetic operations to calculate the total number of birds:\n   - Multiply `NumCages` by the number of parrots per cage to get the total number of parrots.\n   - Multiply `NumCages` by the number of parakeets per cage to get the total number of parakeets.\n   - Sum the total number of parrots and parakeets to derive the `TotalBirds`.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for `TotalBirds` by querying the `total_birds` predicate with the given values.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code would look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the total number of birds\ntotal_birds(NumCages, BirdsPerCage, TotalBirds) :-\n    TotalParrots is NumCages * BirdsPerCage,\n    TotalParakeets is NumCages * BirdsPerCage,\n    TotalBirds is TotalParrots + TotalParakeets.\n\n% Example query to calculate the total number of birds\n% ?- total_birds(9, 4, TotalBirds).\n% This query should output the total number of birds in the pet store.\n```\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.

During the game, Adam answered 5 questions correctly in the first half and another 5 questions correctly in the second half. The task is to calculate his final score based on the number of correct answers and the points earned per answer.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find Adam's final score, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. **Points per Correct Answer**: Each correct answer earns Adam 5 points.\n2. **Total Points in the First Half**: Multiply the number of correct answers in the first half (5) by the points earned per correct answer (5).\n3. **Total Points in the Second Half**: Similarly, multiply the number of correct answers in the second half (5) by the points earned per correct answer (5).\n4. **Final Score**: Add the total points earned in both halves to get Adam's final score.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Adam's final score based on the given inputs, such as the number of correct answers in each half and the points earned per correct answer. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `points_per_answer(Points)` to represent the points earned per correct answer.\n   - `correct_answers_first_half(NumAnswers)` to represent the number of correct answers in the first half.\n   - `correct_answers_second_half(NumAnswers)` to represent the number of correct answers in the second half.\n   - `final_score(FirstHalfPoints, SecondHalfPoints, TotalScore)` to calculate the final score based on the points earned in each half.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.\n   - For example, `FirstHalfPoints is NumAnswers * PointsPerAnswer`.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the number of correct answers in each half and the points per correct answer, and check if the output matches the expected final score.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule for calculating final score\nfinal_score(FirstHalfPoints, SecondHalfPoints, TotalScore) :-\n    FirstHalfPoints is 5 * 5, % 5 correct answers in the first half\n    SecondHalfPoints is 5 * 5, % 5 correct answers in the second half\n    TotalScore is FirstHalfPoints + SecondHalfPoints. % Sum of both halves\n\n% Example query to calculate the final score\n?- final_score(FirstHalf, SecondHalf, Total).\n% This should output Total as 50, assuming 5 points per correct answer.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates Adam's final score in the trivia game, demonstrating how Prolog can be used to solve basic arithmetic problems through logical inference and rule-based programming.",

        "question": "Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nHaley, a devoted fan of a band, enthusiastically plans to attend their concert with her friends. She purchases three tickets for her immediate group and, in a generous gesture, buys five additional tickets for anyone else who might be interested in joining. Each ticket to the concert costs a modest $4. The task at hand is to calculate the total amount of money Haley spends on these tickets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total expenditure, we need to consider two sets of tickets: those bought for her friends and the extra ones. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Tickets for Friends**: Haley buys three tickets, each costing $4.\n   - Calculation: Number of tickets * Cost per ticket = Total cost for friends' tickets\n   - Formula: 3 tickets * $4/ticket = $12\n\n2. **Extra Tickets**: Haley purchases five additional tickets, each at the same price of $4.\n   - Calculation: Number of extra tickets * Cost per ticket = Total cost for extra tickets\n   - Formula: 5 tickets * $4/ticket = $20\n\n3. **Total Expenditure**: To find out Haley's overall spending, we sum up the costs from the two categories:\n   - Total expenditure = Cost for friends' tickets + Cost for extra tickets\n   - Formula: $12 (friends' tickets) + $20 (extra tickets) = $32\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total amount Haley spends based on the number of tickets bought for friends and the number of extra tickets. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `friends_tickets(NumTickets, CostPerTicket, TotalCost)` to calculate the cost of tickets for friends.\n   - `extra_tickets(NumExtraTickets, CostPerTicket, ExtraTicketsCost)` to calculate the cost of extra tickets.\n   - `total_spending(FriendsCost, ExtraCost, TotalAmount)` to compute Haley's overall expenditure.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to perform calculations.\n   - For `friends_tickets`, multiply the number of tickets by the cost per ticket.\n   - Similarly, for `extra_tickets`, multiply the number of extra tickets by the cost per ticket.\n   - In the `total_spending` predicate, sum up the costs from the two categories to find the total amount spent.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Input the number of tickets bought for friends and the number of extra tickets.\n   - Verify that the output matches the expected total amount spent, which is $32 in this case.\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve the problem and validate the correctness of the solution through testing with known values.",

        "question": "There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn the context of an online video game, lives refer to the number of chances or attempts a player has to continue playing after facing obstacles or challenges. In this scenario, we have a dynamic situation where two friends are initially playing, and then two more players join them. Each player possesses a fixed number of lives, specifically six lives each. The objective is to calculate the total number of lives among all the players.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of lives, we need to consider the contribution of lives from each player. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Initial State**: Two friends are playing, and each of them has 6 lives. So, initially, there are 2 players with 6 lives each, resulting in a total of 2 * 6 = 12 lives.\n2. **Change in Situation**: Two more players join the game, and each of them also has 6 lives.\n3. **Final State**: Now, there are a total of 4 players, and each player still has 6 lives.\n4. **Total Lives Calculation**: To find the total number of lives among all the players, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has: 4 players * 6 lives/player = 24 lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n**Predicates**:\n- Define a predicate `lives_per_player(Lives)` to represent the fact that each player has a fixed number of lives (6 lives in this case).\n- Define a predicate `initial_players(Players)` to represent the initial number of players (2 players).\n- Define a predicate `additional_players(Players)` to represent the number of players who joined later (2 more players).\n- Define a predicate `total_lives(TotalLives)` to calculate and represent the total number of lives among all players.\n\n**Code Structure**:\n```prolog\n% Define the number of lives per player\nlives_per_player(6).\n\n% Calculate the total lives for the initial players\ninitial_total_lives(InitialPlayers, InitialTotalLives) :-\n    lives_per_player(LivesPerPlayer),\n    InitialTotalLives is InitialPlayers * LivesPerPlayer.\n\n% Calculate the total lives for the additional players\nadditional_total_lives(AdditionalPlayers, AdditionalTotalLives) :-\n    lives_per_player(LivesPerPlayer),\n    AdditionalTotalLives is AdditionalPlayers * LivesPerPlayer.\n\n% Calculate the total lives for all players\ntotal_lives(TotalLives) :-\n    initial_players(InitialPlayers),\n    additional_players(AdditionalPlayers),\n    initial_total_lives(InitialPlayers, InitialTotalLives),\n    additional_total_lives(AdditionalPlayers, AdditionalTotalLives),\n    TotalLives is InitialTotalLives + AdditionalTotalLives.\n```\n\n**Testing**:\nTo test the implementation, we can query the `total_lives/1` predicate with the number of players to verify that it returns the expected total number of lives.\n\nThis plan outlines a clear structure for the SWI-Prolog code, utilizing predicates to represent different aspects of the problem and leveraging Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.",

Each correct answer earns him points, and the value of each point is specified as three points per question.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Frank's final score, we can follow these steps:\n1. **Points in the First Half**: Multiply the number of correct answers in the first half by the points per question.\n   - Number of correct answers in the first half = 3\n   - Points per question = 3\n   - Total points in the first half = 3 correct answers * 3 points/answer = 9 points\n\n2. **Points in the Second Half**: Similarly, calculate the points earned in the second half.\n   - Number of correct answers in the second half = 2\n   - Points per question (same as before) = 3\n   - Total points in the second half = 2 correct answers * 3 points/answer = 6 points\n\n3. **Final Score**: Add the points from both halves to find Frank's final score.\n   - Final score = Total points in the first half + Total points in the second half\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate `points_first_half/2` to calculate the points earned in the first half based on the number of correct answers.\n   - Create a predicate `points_second_half/2` to calculate the points earned in the second half.\n   - Define a predicate `final_score/3` that takes the correct answers for both halves and calculates the final score.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use arithmetic operations within the predicates to multiply the number of correct answers by the points per question.\n   - Ensure that the predicates are structured to represent the relationships between the variables correctly.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `final_score` predicate with the given values (3 correct answers in the first half and 2 in the second half) to determine Frank's final score.\n\nHere's a possible outline for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate points earned in the first half\npoints_first_half(CorrectAnswersFirstHalf, PointsFirstHalf) :-\n    PointsFirstHalf is CorrectAnswersFirstHalf * 3.\n\n% Calculate points earned in the second half\npoints_second_half(CorrectAnswersSecondHalf, PointsSecondHalf) :-\n    PointsSecondHalf is CorrectAnswersSecondHalf * 3.\n\n% Calculate the final score\nfinal_score(CorrectFirst, CorrectSecond, FinalScore) :-\n    points_first_half(CorrectFirst, PointsFirst),\n    points_second_half(CorrectSecond, PointsSecond),\n    FinalScore is PointsFirst + PointsSecond.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the logic for calculating the points earned in each half and the final score, utilizing arithmetic operations to multiply the number of correct answers by the points per question.",

        "question": "There were 5 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, there was an initial group of five friends playing a video game online. The game involves each player having a certain number of lives, which are essentially chances or attempts at progressing through the game. During their gameplay, two more players joined their session, adding to the total count of players. The task is to determine the total number of lives among all the players, given that each player starts with the same number of lives, specifically eight lives each.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of lives among all the players, we need to consider the initial group of five friends and the additional two players who joined. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Lives**: Each of the first five friends starts with 8 lives. So, for these five players, the total lives can be calculated as: 5 players * 8 lives/player = 40 lives.\n2. **Additional Lives**: When the two new players join, they also bring their own set of 8 lives each. This adds to the overall total: 2 players * 8 lives/player = 16 lives.\n3. **Total Lives**: To find the collective total, we sum up the lives from the initial group and the additional lives from the new players: 40 lives + 16 lives = 56 lives.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate named `total_lives/2` that takes the initial number of friends and the number of additional friends as input.\n2. **Calculate Initial Lives**:\n   - Within the `total_lives/2` predicate, calculate the total lives contributed by the initial group of friends. This can be done by multiplying the number of initial friends by the lives each player starts with.\n3. **Calculate Additional Lives**:\n   - Calculate the additional lives brought by the new players who joined. This is also computed by multiplying the number of additional friends by the lives per player.\n4. **Compute Total Lives**:\n   - Sum up the initial lives and the additional lives to find the overall total.\n5. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `total_lives/2` predicate with the given values (initial friends = 5, additional friends = 2) to verify that the output matches the expected total lives (56 lives).\n\nHere's a simplified outline of the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total lives\ntotal_lives(InitialFriends, AdditionalFriends, TotalLives) :-\n    % Calculate lives from initial friends\n    InitialLives is InitialFriends * LivesPerPlayer,\n    % Calculate lives from additional friends\n    AdditionalLives is AdditionalFriends * LivesPerPlayer,\n    % Compute the overall total lives\n    TotalLives is InitialLives + AdditionalLives.\n\n% Example query to calculate total lives\n% ?- total_lives(5, 2, TotalLives).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code efficiently calculates the total number of lives among the group of friends, showcasing how Prolog can be used to model and solve practical problems through logical inference and arithmetic operations.",

The task is to calculate the total number of books she has by considering the number of shelves and the number of books per shelf for each category.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of books Chloe has, we need to consider the number of shelves for each type of book and the number of books per shelf. Here's the breakdown:\n1. Mystery Books: Chloe has 5 shelves dedicated to mystery books, and each shelf contains 6 books. So, for mystery books, the calculation is:\n   - Number of Mystery Books = Number of Shelves * Books per Shelf\n   - Mystery Books = 5 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 30 books\n\n2. Picture Books: Chloe has 4 shelves for picture books, and each shelf also contains 6 books. The calculation for picture books is:\n   - Number of Picture Books = Number of Shelves * Books per Shelf\n   - Picture Books = 4 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 24 books\n\n3. Total Books: To find the total number of books Chloe has, we sum up the number of mystery books and picture books:\n   - Total Books = Number of Mystery Books + Number of Picture Books\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a rule \"total_books\" that takes into account the number of shelves for each type of book and the number of books per shelf.\n2. Calculate the total number of books for each category (mystery and picture) by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf.\n3.

We can use the same calculation as above to find the total number of songs from pop albums:\n    - Number of songs from pop albums = Number of pop albums * Songs per album\n3. To find the grand total of songs Isabel bought, we sum up the songs from both country and pop albums:\n    - Total songs = Songs from country albums + Songs from pop albums\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n1. **Predicates**:\n   - Define a predicate `songs_from_albums(NumAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalSongs)` to calculate the total number of songs from a certain number of albums, each containing the same number of songs.\n   - Create a rule `total_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, TotalSongs)` to compute the overall total number of songs Isabel bought. This rule will use the `songs_from_albums/3` predicate twice\u2014once for country albums and once for pop albums\u2014and sum the results.\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform multiplication and addition operations within the defined predicates.\n3. **Test Case**:\n   - Create a query to test the `total_songs/3` predicate with the given values: Isabel bought 6 country albums and 2 pop albums, and each album contains 9 songs.\n\nHere's a potential outline for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total number of songs from a certain number of albums\nsongs_from_albums(NumAlbums, SongsPerAlbum, TotalSongs) :-\n    TotalSongs is NumAlbums * SongsPerAlbum.\n\n% Compute the total number of songs Isabel bought\ntotal_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, TotalSongs) :-\n    songs_from_albums(CountryAlbums, 9, CountrySongs),\n    songs_from_albums(PopAlbums, 9, PopSongs),\n    TotalSongs is CountrySongs + PopSongs.\n```\n\nThis code defines the logic to calculate the total number of songs Isabel acquired, taking into account the number of albums she bought of each type and the number of songs per album.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRobin visited April's discount flower shop, where each flower was priced at a uniform rate of $3. She purchased a combination of roses and daisies, specifically 5 roses and 4 daisies. The objective is to calculate the total amount Robin spent on her floral purchase.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total expenditure, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of one flower: $3\n2. Calculate the cost of roses by multiplying the cost per flower by the number of roses purchased: $3 * 5 = $15\n3. Calculate the cost of daisies by multiplying the cost per flower by the number of daisies purchased: $3 * 4 = $12\n4. Sum the costs of the roses and daisies to find the total amount spent: $15 + $12 = $27\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total amount spent based on the number of roses and daisies Robin bought, considering the fixed price per flower. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `total_spent(NumRoses, NumDaisies, TotalAmountSpent)` that takes the number of roses and daisies as input.\n2. Calculate the cost of roses by multiplying the number of roses by the price per flower: `RosesCost is NumRoses * 3`.\n3. Calculate the cost of daisies by multiplying the number of daisies by the price per flower: `DaisiesCost is NumDaisies * 3`.\n4. Compute the `TotalAmountSpent` by summing the costs of roses and daisies: `TotalAmountSpent is RosesCost + DaisiesCost`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations.\n6. Test the rule by querying with the specific values provided in the problem: `?- total_spent(5, 4, TotalAmountSpent).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total amount spent\ntotal_spent(NumRoses, NumDaisies, TotalAmountSpent) :-\n    RosesCost is NumRoses * 3,\n    DaisiesCost is NumDaisies * 3,\n    TotalAmountSpent is RosesCost + DaisiesCost.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the total amount Robin spent on roses and daisies, showcasing how logical programming can be applied to solve practical problems involving arithmetic operations and simple constraints.",

        "question": "Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 4 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nGwen is arranging her bookshelves, ensuring that each shelf contains exactly four books. She has dedicated a certain number of shelves to mystery books and another number of shelves to picture books. The problem is to determine the total number of books she has across these two categories of shelves.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of books Gwen has, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Number of Mystery Books**: This is calculated by multiplying the number of shelves for mystery books by the number of books per shelf.\n2. **Number of Picture Books**: Similarly, this is calculated by multiplying the number of shelves for picture books by the number of books per shelf.\n3. **Total Number of Books**: To find the overall count of books, we sum the number of mystery books and picture books.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the total number of books based on the given information about the number of shelves for each type of book and the constant number of books per shelf.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIsabel went on a music shopping spree and bought albums from two different genres: country and pop. She purchased a specific number of albums from each genre, and each album came with a set number of songs. Now, we need to calculate the total number of songs she acquired during this shopping trip.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of songs Isabel bought, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Isabel bought two different types of albums: country albums and pop albums.\n2. She bought a specific quantity of each type: 4 country albums and 5 pop albums.\n3. Each album, regardless of genre, contains the same number of songs: 8 songs per album.\n\nTo calculate the total number of songs, we multiply the number of albums of each type by the number of songs per album and then sum these counts.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a straightforward rule that calculates the total number of songs based on the given quantities of country and pop albums and the songs per album. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, TotalSongs)` that relates the number of country albums, pop albums, and the total number of songs.\n2. Within this predicate, calculate the total number of songs from country albums by multiplying the number of country albums by the songs per album: `CountrySongs is CountryAlbums * SongsPerAlbum`.\n3. Similarly, calculate the total number of songs from pop albums: `PopSongs is PopAlbums * SongsPerAlbum`.\n4. Compute the `TotalSongs` by summing up `CountrySongs` and `PopSongs`: `TotalSongs is CountrySongs + PopSongs`.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and infer the total number of songs Isabel bought.\n6. Query the `total_songs` predicate with the given values of country and pop albums to find the solution: `?- total_songs(4, 5, TotalSongs).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_songs(CountryAlbums, PopAlbums, TotalSongs) :-\n    CountrySongs is CountryAlbums * SongsPerAlbum,\n    PopSongs is PopAlbums * SongsPerAlbum,\n    TotalSongs is CountrySongs + PopSongs.\n```\n\nThis code will allow us to compute the total number of songs Isabel acquired during her music shopping spree, showcasing how Prolog can be used to solve basic arithmetic problems with clear logical relationships.",

Define predicates to represent the bird counts in each cage:\n   - `parrots_per_cage(Count)` to represent there are 2 parrots in each cage.\n   - `parakeets_per_cage(Count)` to represent there are 6 parakeets in each cage.\n2. Define a predicate `total_birds(Cages, TotalBirds)` that calculates the total number of birds in the pet store. It will use the bird counts in each cage and the number of cages:\n   - `total_birds(Cages, TotalBirds) :- parrots_per_cage(ParrotsPerCage), parakeets_per_cage(ParakeetsPerCage), TotalBirds is (ParrotsPerCage + ParakeetsPerCage) * Cages.`\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the total number of birds in the pet store given the number of cages:\n   - `?- total_birds(9, TotalBirds).`\n4. The code will use logical inference and arithmetic operations to compute the total number of birds based on the given bird counts per cage and the number of cages.\n\nThis plan uses Prolog's capabilities for logical reasoning and arithmetic to calculate the total number of birds in the pet store, providing a clear and concise solution to the problem.",

The scoring system is straightforward: she receives 6 points for each treasure she discovers. During her gameplay session, she found a certain number of treasures on two different levels.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIsabel sold two types of necklaces at her garage sale: bead necklaces and gemstone necklaces. She sold the same number of each type, which is three bead necklaces and three gemstone necklaces. Each necklace had a set price of $6. The task is to calculate the total amount of money Isabel earned from these sales.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Isabel earned, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue from selling bead necklaces: Number of bead necklaces (3) multiplied by the price per bead necklace ($6).\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling gemstone necklaces: Number of gemstone necklaces (3) multiplied by the price per gemstone necklace ($6).\n3. Add the revenues from the two types of necklaces to find the total amount of money earned.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define predicates that represent the sales of each type of necklace and then calculate the total earnings. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `bead_necklace_earnings(NumBeadNecklaces, BeadEarnings)` that calculates the earnings from selling the specified number of bead necklaces.\n2. Define a predicate `gemstone_necklace_earnings(NumGemstoneNecklaces, GemstoneEarnings)` that calculates the earnings from selling the specified number of gemstone necklaces.\n3.

The task is to determine the total number of birds in the pet store by multiplying the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the given values:\n   - Number of bird cages = 4\n   - Number of parrots in each cage = 8\n   - Number of parakeets in each cage = 2\n\n2. Calculate the total number of birds:\n   - For parrots: Number of cages * Number of parrots per cage\n   - For parakeets: Number of cages * Number of parakeets per cage\n   - Total birds = Total parrots + Total parakeets\n\n3. Sum up the totals for parrots and parakeets to find the overall bird count in the pet store.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate `total_birds(Cages, ParrotsPerCage, ParakeetsPerCage, TotalBirds)` to calculate the total number of birds.\n\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Use the `*` operator to calculate the total number of parrots and parakeets based on the number of cages and birds per cage.\n   - Use the `+` operator to sum the totals for parrots and parakeets, resulting in the `TotalBirds`.\n\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `total_birds` predicate with the given values: 4 cages, 8 parrots per cage, and 2 parakeets per cage.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the total number of birds\ntotal_birds(Cages, ParrotsPerCage, ParakeetsPerCage, TotalBirds) :-\n    TotalParrots is Cages * ParrotsPerCage,\n    TotalParakeets is Cages * ParakeetsPerCage,\n    TotalBirds is TotalParrots + TotalParakeets.\n\n% Query the predicate with the given values\nquery_total_birds(TotalBirds) :-\n    total_birds(4, 8, 2, TotalBirds).\n```\n\nThis code sets up the logic to calculate the total number of birds in the pet store based on the number of cages and birds per cage.

        "question": "Lana was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 3 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 3 scarves and 4 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Lana have total?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nLana discovered winter clothing stored in three separate boxes, and each box contained an identical set of items\u2014specifically, three scarves and four mittens. The problem requires us to calculate the total number of winter clothing items Lana possesses across all three boxes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the total number of winter clothing items Lana has, we need to consider the contents of each box and then sum up the quantities for each type of item. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Each box contains 3 scarves, so the total number of scarves is 3 * 3 = 9.\n2. Similarly, each box contains 4 mittens, resulting in a total of 4 * 3 = 12 mittens.\n3. To find the grand total of winter clothing items, we add the quantities of scarves and mittens: 9 (scarves) + 12 (mittens) = 21 items.\n\nTherefore, Lana has a total of 21 winter clothing items across the three boxes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define predicates to represent the contents of each box:\n   - `scarves_per_box(NumScarves)`.\n   - `mittens_per_box(NumMittens)`.\n2. Create a predicate to calculate the total number of scarves and mittens:\n   - `total_items(NumBoxes, TotalScarves, TotalMittens)`.\n3. Implement a predicate to compute the grand total of winter clothing items:\n   - `grand_total(TotalItems)`.\n4. Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - To find the total number of scarves: `TotalScarves is NumBoxes * NumScarvesPerBox`.\n   - Similarly, for mittens: `TotalMittens is NumBoxes * NumMittensPerBox`.\n5. Define the number of boxes Lana has (3 in this case) and query the `grand_total` predicate to obtain the final count of winter clothing items.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the contents of each box\nscarves_per_box(3).\nmittens_per_box(4).\n\n% Calculate the total number of scarves and mittens\ntotal_items(NumBoxes, TotalScarves, TotalMittens) :-\n    TotalScarves is NumBoxes * 3,\n    TotalMittens is NumBoxes * 4.\n\n% Compute the grand total of winter clothing items\ngrand_total(TotalItems) :-\n    total_items(3, TotalScarves, TotalMittens),\n    TotalItems is TotalScarves + TotalMittens.\n```\n\nBy executing the `grand_total` predicate, SWI-Prolog will compute the total number of winter clothing items Lana has, which aligns with the analytical solution of 21 items.",

To find the number of groups, we need to consider the number of students and the size of each group.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students:\n   - Total students = 11 boys + 45 girls = 56 students.\n2. Determine the maximum number of groups that can be formed:\n   - Maximum groups = Total students / Size of each group.\n3. Calculate the remainder to determine if there are any students left who cannot form a complete group:\n   - Remainder = Total students modulo Size of each group.\n\nThe number of groups that can be formed is the maximum number of groups, and there will be a remainder of students who cannot form a complete group if the remainder is not zero.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of groups that can be formed based on the total number of students and the specified group size.

        "question": "For Halloween Sarah received 66 pieces of candy from neighbors and 15 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 9 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nSarah received a total of 66 pieces of candy from neighbors and an additional 15 pieces from her older sister, resulting in a total of 81 pieces of candy. She plans to consume a fixed amount of candy per day, specifically 9 pieces. To determine how long her candy will last, we need to divide the total number of candies by the number of candies she eats each day.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of candies Sarah has by adding the candies received from neighbors and her sister.\n2. Divide the total number of candies by the number of candies she eats in a day.\n3. Interpret the result as the number of days the candy will last.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how long the candy will last based on the given input values. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_candies(Neighbors, Sister, Total)` that calculates the total number of candies Sarah received. Here, `Neighbors` represents the candies received from neighbors, and `Sister` represents the candies received from her sister.\n2. Define a predicate `candy_duration(Total, Daily, Days)` that computes how long the candy will last. Here, `Total` is the total number of candies, `Daily` is the number of candies Sarah eats per day, and `Days` is the output representing how many days the candy will last.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division and calculate the number of days.\n4. Test the implementation by querying the `candy_duration` predicate with the given values to verify that it yields the expected result.\n\nHere's a possible SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_candies(Neighbors, Sister, Total) :-\n    Total is Neighbors + Sister.\n\ncandy_duration(Total, Daily, Days) :-\n    Days is ceil(Total / Daily).\n\n% Sample query to test the implementation\n% ?- candy_duration(81, 9, Days).\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `ceil` function to ensure that the result of the division is rounded up to the nearest integer, ensuring that the candy will last for at least that many days even if there is a fractional remainder. This plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.",

        "question": "A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the number of days it will take for all the puppies at the shelter to be adopted. Initially, the shelter had 17 puppies, and then 55 more puppies were brought in, increasing the total count. The adoption rate is consistent, with 8 puppies being adopted each day. The goal is to find out how many days it will take to adopt all these puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of puppies at the shelter after the additional 55 puppies are brought in:\n   - Initial count = 17\n   - Final count = Initial count + 55 = 17 + 55 = 72\n\n2. Determine the number of days it will take to adopt all the puppies:\n   - Given that 8 puppies are adopted each day, we can divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:\n   - Number of days = Total number of puppies / Puppies adopted per day\n\n3. Simplify the calculation:\n   - Number of days = 72 / 8\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of days required to adopt all the puppies based on the given information. Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_puppies(InitialCount, AdditionalCount, TotalCount)` that calculates the total number of puppies after the additional puppies are brought in.\n2. Define another predicate `adoption_time(TotalCount, PuppiesPerDay, Days)` that computes the number of days required to adopt all the puppies.\n3. Implement the predicates using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities:\n   - To calculate `TotalCount` in the first predicate, use `TotalCount is InitialCount + AdditionalCount`.\n   - To calculate `Days` in the second predicate, use `Days is ceil(TotalCount / PuppiesPerDay)`. The `ceil` function ensures that the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number, as partial days don't make sense in this context.\n4. Instantiate the predicates with the given values:\n   - `total_puppies(17, 55, TotalCount)`\n   - `adoption_time(TotalCount, 8, Days)`\n5. Query the `adoption_time` predicate to find out the number of days needed to adopt all the puppies.\n\nBy following this plan, we can effectively use SWI-Prolog to solve the problem and determine how long it will take for all the puppies to be adopted.",

The team has 12 new players and 44 returning players, and the coach wants to organize them into groups of 8 players each. The task is to calculate how many groups can be formed with this arrangement.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of players:\n   - Add the number of new players (12) to the number of returning players (44) to find the total count.\n\n2.

        "question": "A toy store had 6 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 18 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 6 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, a toy store initially had six giant stuffed bears in stock. They received a shipment of 18 more bears and wanted to arrange them on shelves with a specific number of bears per shelf. The task is to determine how many shelves they used in total to display these bears.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the given information**:\n   - Initial number of bears: 6\n   - Number of bears in the shipment: 18\n   - Number of bears per shelf: 6\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of bears after the shipment**:\n   - Initial bears + bears in the shipment = Total bears\n\n3. **Calculate the number of shelves used**:\n   - Total bears / Bears per shelf = Number of shelves\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define predicates**:\n   - Create a predicate `initial_bears/1` to represent the initial number of bears the store had.\n   - Create a predicate `shipment_bears/1` to represent the number of bears that arrived in the shipment.\n   - Create a predicate `bears_per_shelf/1` to represent the number of bears placed on each shelf.\n   - Create a predicate `total_bears/1` to calculate the total number of bears after the shipment.\n   - Create a predicate `shelves_used/1` to calculate the number of shelves used based on the total number of bears and bears per shelf.\n\n2. **Implement the predicates**:\n   - For each predicate, use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n3. **Query the solution**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the number of shelves used based on the defined predicates and their relationships.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define initial number of bears\ninitial_bears(6).\n\n% Define number of bears in the shipment\nshipment_bears(18).\n\n% Define number of bears per shelf\nbears_per_shelf(6).\n\n% Calculate total number of bears\ntotal_bears(Total) :-\n    initial_bears(Initial),\n    shipment_bears(Shipment),\n    Total is Initial + Shipment.\n\n% Calculate number of shelves used\nshelves_used(Shelves) :-\n    total_bears(TotalBears),\n    bears_per_shelf(BearsPerShelf),\n    Shelves is TotalBears / BearsPerShelf.\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationships between the number of bears and shelves, using arithmetic operations to calculate the final answer.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJerry is tasked with picking up lunch trays, but he has a limit of carrying only eight trays at a time. He needs to collect nine trays from one table and seven trays from another. The problem is to determine the number of trips he needs to make to accomplish this task.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Total Trays**: Calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up, which is nine trays from one table plus seven trays from another, resulting in a total of sixteen trays.\n2. **Number of Trips**: Divide the total number of trays by the maximum number of trays Jerry can carry per trip (eight trays).

This will give us the number of vases needed to accommodate all the flowers. We can perform this calculation as follows:\n\n- Total number of flowers = 6 carnations + 19 roses = 25 flowers\n- Number of vases required = Total number of flowers / Capacity of each vase\n- Number of vases required = 25 / 5 = 5 vases\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the number of vases needed based on the total number of flowers and the vase capacity.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nIn this problem, we are given the initial number of puppies at a pet shelter, the number of additional puppies brought in, and the rate at which puppies are adopted each day. The task is to determine how many days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Find the total number of puppies at the shelter after the additional puppies are brought in:\n   - Initial number of puppies = 8\n   - Number of additional puppies = 19\n   - Total number of puppies = Initial number + Additional puppies = 8 + 19 = 27\n\n2. Determine how long it will take to adopt all the puppies at the given rate:\n   - Number of puppies adopted per day = 3\n   - Calculate the number of days needed to adopt all puppies: Total number of puppies / Puppies adopted per day\n\n3. Perform the division and round the result to the nearest whole number, as we cannot have a fraction of a day.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can structure our code as follows:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_puppies(Initial, Additional, Total)` that calculates the total number of puppies after additional puppies are brought in.\n2.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of trays: 20 trays from one table + 16 trays from another = 36 trays.\n2. Divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Luke can carry in one trip (4 trays). This will give us the number of trips required.\n3. Since the number of trays (36) is divisible by the number of trays Luke can carry (4), we can simply divide 36 by 4 to get the number of trips.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of trips required based on the total number of trays and the number of trays Luke can carry per trip. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_trips(TotalTrays, TripsPerLoad, TotalTrips)` that calculates the total number of trips required.\n2. Use integer division (`//`) to calculate the number of trips. In Prolog, `A // B` divides `A` by `B` and returns the result as an integer.\n3. Set up the relationships between the variables:\n   - `TotalTrays` is the sum of trays from both tables.\n   - `TripsPerLoad` is the number of trays Luke can carry per trip.\n   - `TotalTrips` is the result obtained by dividing `TotalTrays` by `TripsPerLoad`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to compute the result:\n   ```prolog\n   total_trips(TotalTrays, TripsPerLoad, TotalTrips) :-\n       TotalTrips is TotalTrays // TripsPerLoad.\n   ```\n5. Query the predicate with the given values to find the number of trips:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- total_trips(20 + 16, 4, TotalTrips).\n   ```\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference.",

        "question": "Vanessa and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 9 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Vanessa recycled 20 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVanessa and her friends are engaged in a recycling initiative where they earn points for the amount of paper they recycle. The system awards one point for every 9 pounds of recycled paper. In this scenario, Vanessa has recycled 20 pounds of paper, and her friends have collectively recycled 16 pounds. The task is to determine the total number of points they have earned.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of recycled paper by summing Vanessa's contribution and her friends' contribution: 20 pounds + 16 pounds.\n2. Determine the number of points earned by dividing the total recycled paper by the required amount for one point (9 pounds).\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be designed to calculate the total number of points earned based on the given weights of recycled paper. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_recycled_weight(VanessaWeight, FriendsWeight, TotalWeight)` that calculates the total weight of recycled paper by summing Vanessa's weight and her friends' weight.\n2. Define a predicate `points_earned(TotalWeight, Points)` that calculates the number of points earned by dividing the `TotalWeight` by the required weight for one point (9 pounds).\n3.

Then, we determine the number of points earned by dividing the total weight by 9, using integer division (`//`) to ensure we get a whole number of points. The `query_points_earned` predicate ties everything together, computing the total points earned based on the given weights.",

The question asks how long it would take for all these puppies to be adopted if 4 puppies are adopted per day. This problem involves calculating the number of days required to adopt all the puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of puppies that need to be adopted: Initial number of puppies + additional puppies = 2 + 34 = 36 puppies.\n2.

        "question": "Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 8 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds, how many points did they earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nZoe and her friends are engaged in a recycling initiative where they earn points for the amount of paper they recycle. The rules of the initiative specify that for every 8 pounds of recycled paper, they earn one point. Zoe and her friends have collectively recycled a certain amount of paper, and we want to determine how many points they have earned based on the total weight of the recycled paper.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of recycled paper by summing up the contributions from Zoe and her friends:\n   - Zoe's contribution: 25 pounds\n   - Friends' contribution: 23 pounds\n   - Total weight: 25 pounds + 23 pounds = 48 pounds\n2. Determine the number of points earned based on the total weight. Given that one point is earned for every 8 pounds, we can calculate the number of points by dividing the total weight by 8.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of points earned based on the total weight of recycled paper. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `points_earned(TotalWeight, Points)` that relates the total weight of recycled paper to the number of points earned.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the number of points. For every 8 pounds, one point is earned, so we can divide the `TotalWeight` by 8 to get the `Points`.\n3. Implement the predicate with the given values: `points_earned(48, Points)`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the number of points earned: `?- points_earned(48, Points).`\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on the plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate points earned\npoints_earned(TotalWeight, Points) :-\n    Points is TotalWeight // 8.\n\n% Query to find the number of points earned for 48 pounds of recycled paper\nquery_points_earned(Points) :-\n    points_earned(48, Points).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationship between the total weight of recycled paper and the number of points earned.

The task is to determine how many pages he will need to fit all his baseball cards.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of pages Billy will use, we need to calculate the total number of cards and then divide that by the number of cards that can fit on one page. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cards: Add the number of new cards (3) to the number of old cards (42) to get a sum of 45 cards.\n2.

He needs to collect 23 trays from one table and an additional 5 trays from another. To determine the number of trips he needs to make, we must calculate how many times he can carry 7 trays to pick up all the given trays.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of trays by the maximum Victor can carry in one trip. This can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Find the total number of trays: 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, resulting in a total of 28 trays.\n2. Calculate the number of trips by dividing the total number of trays by the maximum carrying capacity (7 trays).\n3. Since the total number of trays may not be evenly divisible by the maximum carrying capacity, we need to consider the remainder.\n4. If there is a remainder, Victor will need to make one more trip to carry the remaining trays.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of trips required based on the given tray counts and carrying capacity. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `trips_required(TotalTrays, MaxCarry, Trips)` that takes the total number of trays, the maximum carrying capacity, and computes the number of trips required.\n2. Calculate the initial number of trips by dividing `TotalTrays` by `MaxCarry`.\n3. Use the mod (`Mod`) operator to find the remainder when `TotalTrays` is divided by `MaxCarry`.\n4. If the remainder is not zero, increment the number of trips by one to account for the remaining trays.\n5.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nFrank has earned money from mowing lawns and weed eating, and he wants to know how long his money will last given his weekly spending. To determine this, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has, consider his weekly expenditure, and then divide the total amount by his weekly spending to find the number of weeks his money will cover.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations required:\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Frank has:\n   - Earnings from mowing lawns: $5\n   - Earnings from weed eating: $58\n   - Total earnings: $5 + $58 = $63\n\n2. Determine Frank's weekly spending:\n   - Weekly expenditure: $7\n\n3. Calculate how long the money will last:\n   - Divide the total amount of money by the weekly spending: $63 / $7\n\nThe result will give the number of weeks Frank's money will last.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates how long Frank's money will last based on his earnings and weekly spending. Here's a step-by-step plan for the Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule named `money_duration` that takes parameters for Frank's earnings from mowing lawns (`MowingEarnings`), earnings from weed eating (`WeedEatingEarnings`), and his weekly spending (`WeeklySpending`).\n2. Calculate the total amount of money Frank has by summing his earnings from mowing lawns and weed eating: `TotalMoney` is `MowingEarnings + WeedEatingEarnings`.\n3. Calculate the number of weeks the money will last by dividing the `TotalMoney` by the `WeeklySpending`: `Duration` is `TotalMoney // WeeklySpending`.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations and comparisons.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that follows this plan:\n\n```prolog\nmoney_duration(MowingEarnings, WeedEatingEarnings, WeeklySpending, Duration) :-\n    TotalMoney is MowingEarnings + WeedEatingEarnings,\n    Duration is TotalMoney // WeeklySpending.\n\n% Example query to calculate the duration\n% ?- money_duration(5, 58, 7, Duration).\n% This should output the number of weeks the money will last.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the duration for which Frank's money will last using simple arithmetic operations and logical inference, showcasing how Prolog can be used to solve practical financial planning problems.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the time it will take for a builder to install the remaining windows in a new building. The builder has already installed 6 windows, and each window installation takes 5 hours. We need to determine how long it will take to install the remaining windows out of the required 10.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Find the number of remaining windows: Subtract the number of installed windows from the total required windows.\n2. Calculate the total time needed to install the remaining windows: Multiply the number of remaining windows by the time taken to install each window.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the time required to install the remaining windows based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `remaining_time` that takes four parameters: the total number of required windows (`TotalWindows`), the number of already installed windows (`InstalledWindows`), the time taken to install each window (`TimePerWindow`), and the variable to unify with the remaining time (`RemainingTime`).\n2. Calculate the number of remaining windows by subtracting the installed windows from the total windows: `RemainingWindows is TotalWindows - InstalledWindows`.\n3. Calculate the remaining time by multiplying the remaining windows by the time taken per window: `RemainingTime is RemainingWindows * TimePerWindow`.\n4.

Initially, he had 12 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 8 of them. The objective is to calculate how much money Adam actually earned for mowing the lawns.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine Adam's earnings, we need to consider the number of lawns he was supposed to mow and the number of lawns he forgot to mow. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n1. **Total Lawns**: Adam initially had 12 lawns to mow.\n2. **Forgotten Lawns**: Out of the 12 lawns, he forgot to mow 8 lawns.\n3. **Lawns Actually Mow**: To find out how many lawns he actually mowed, we subtract the forgotten lawns from the total lawns: 12 - 8 = 4 lawns.\n4. **Earnings per Lawn**: Adam earns $9 for each lawn he mows.\n5. **Total Earnings**: To calculate Adam's total earnings, we multiply the number of lawns he actually mowed by his earnings per lawn: 4 lawns * $9/lawn = $36.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates Adam's total earnings based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. **Define a predicate** `total_earnings` **that takes parameters for the number of lawns Adam was supposed to mow, the number of lawns he forgot to mow, and his earnings per lawn**.\n2. **Calculate the number of lawns actually mowed** by subtracting the forgotten lawns from the total lawns.\n3. **Compute the total earnings** by multiplying the number of lawns actually mowed by the earnings per lawn.\n4. **Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities** to perform the necessary calculations and unify the result with the `total_earnings` predicate.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that follows this plan:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_earnings(TotalLawns, ForgottenLawns, EarningsPerLawn, TotalEarnings) :-\n    LawnsMowed is TotalLawns - ForgottenLawns,\n    TotalEarnings is LawnsMowed * EarningsPerLawn.\n\n% Example query to calculate Adam's total earnings\n% ?- total_earnings(12, 8, 9, TotalEarnings).\n% This should output the total earnings given these values.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates Adam's total earnings based on the number of lawns he mowed and his earnings per lawn.

We want to calculate the total number of points scored by the team during the game, knowing that each member who attended scored 8 points. To find the total points, we need to multiply the number of members present by the points scored per member.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n1.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nWill initially had seven boxes of chocolate candy, each containing four pieces. He then gave three boxes to his little brother. To find out how many pieces Will has left, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in the boxes he kept.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe problem can be solved through the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces in all seven boxes: 7 boxes * 4 pieces/box.\n2. Determine how many pieces Will gave to his brother: 3 boxes (given away) * 4 pieces/box.\n3. Find the number of pieces Will has left by subtracting the pieces he gave from the total pieces in the seven boxes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the number of pieces Will has left. The plan will involve defining predicates for the number of pieces in all boxes, the number of pieces given away, and the remaining pieces Will has.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_pieces_in_boxes(NumBoxes, PiecesPerBox, TotalPieces)` that calculates the total number of pieces in a given number of boxes.\n2. Define a predicate `given_away_pieces(NumBoxesGiven, PiecesPerBox, GivenAwayPieces)` that calculates the number of pieces Will gave to his brother.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe magician sells magic card decks at a set price, and we are given information about the initial and remaining quantities of decks at the start and end of the day, respectively. The problem requires us to calculate the magician's earnings from selling these decks.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the number of decks sold by subtracting the remaining decks from the initial number of decks: 12 decks - 7 remaining decks = 5 decks sold.\n2. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of decks sold by the price per deck: 5 decks * $9/deck = $45.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define rules and predicates to calculate the magician's earnings. The plan involves creating predicates for calculating the number of decks sold and the total earnings.\n\n1. Define a predicate `decks_sold(Initial, Remaining, Sold)` that calculates the number of decks sold based on the initial and remaining quantities:\n   ```prolog\n   decks_sold(Initial, Remaining, Sold) :- Sold is Initial - Remaining.\n   ```\n2. Define a predicate `earnings(Sold, Price, Earnings)` that computes the total earnings given the number of decks sold and the price per deck:\n   ```prolog\n   earnings(Sold, Price, Earnings) :- Earnings is Sold * Price.\n   ```\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe chef has a specific task: cooking potatoes. He has already cooked 7 potatoes, and each potato takes him 3 minutes to prepare. Now, we want to find out how long it will take for him to cook the remaining potatoes. This problem involves basic arithmetic calculations, specifically multiplication and subtraction, to determine the cooking time for the remaining potatoes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Find the total cooking time for all 9 potatoes by multiplying the number of potatoes by the cooking time per potato: 9 potatoes * 3 minutes/potato.\n2. Calculate the cooking time for the 7 potatoes he has already cooked: 7 potatoes * 3 minutes/potato.\n3. Find the cooking time for the remaining potatoes by subtracting the time taken for the cooked potatoes from the total cooking time.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the cooking time for the remaining potatoes based on the given information. Our plan will involve defining predicates for each step of the calculation, utilizing SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities for multiplication and subtraction.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_cooking_time(NumberOfPotatoes, CookingTimePerPotato, TotalTime)` that calculates the total cooking time for a given number of potatoes.\n2. Define a predicate `cooked_potatoes_time(CookedPotatoes, CookingTimePerPotato, CookedTime)` that calculates the cooking time for the already cooked potatoes.\n3. Define a predicate `remaining_potatoes_time(TotalTime, CookedTime, RemainingTime)` that calculates the cooking time required for the remaining potatoes.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`) to perform the calculations.\n5. Instantiate the predicates with the given values (9 potatoes, 7 cooked potatoes, and 3 minutes per potato) to compute the cooking time for the remaining potatoes.\n\nHere's a step-bystep outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate total cooking time for all potatoes\ntotal_cooking_time(NumberOfPotatoes, CookingTimePerPotato, TotalTime) :-\n    TotalTime is NumberOfPotatoes * CookingTimePerPotato.\n\n% Calculate cooking time for already cooked potatoes\ncooked_potatoes_time(CookedPotatoes, CookingTimePerPotato, CookedTime) :-\n    CookedTime is CookedPotatoes * CookingTimePerPotato.\n\n% Calculate cooking time for remaining potatoes\nremaining_potatoes_time(TotalTime, CookedTime, RemainingTime) :-\n    RemainingTime is TotalTime - CookedTime.\n\n% Query to find the cooking time for the remaining potatoes\nremaining_time(RemainingTime) :-\n    total_cooking_time(9, 3, TotalTime),\n    cooked_potatoes_time(7, 3, CookedTime),\n    remaining_potatoes_time(TotalTime, CookedTime, RemainingTime).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine the cooking time for the remaining potatoes.

It takes into account the total bags she had and the number of bags she did not recycle:\n   ```prolog\n   bags_recycled(TotalBags, RecycledBags) :- RecycledBags is TotalBags - NotRecycledBags.\n   ```\n2. Define a predicate `points_earned(RecycledBags, PointsPerBag, TotalPoints)` that computes the total points Bianca earned. It multiplies the number of recycled bags by the points earned per bag:\n   ```prolog\n   points_earned(RecycledBags, PointsPerBag, TotalPoints) :- TotalPoints is RecycledBags * PointsPerBag.\n   ```\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values from the problem: Bianca had 17 bags (`TotalBags`), she did not recycle 8 bags (`NotRecycledBags`), and she earns 5 points per bag (`PointsPerBag`).\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's query mechanism to find the total points earned:\n   ```prolog\n   ?- bags_recycled(17, RecycledBags), points_earned(RecycledBags, 5, TotalPoints).\n   ```\n\nThis plan outlines a straightforward approach to modeling the problem in SWI-Prolog, utilizing its arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to calculate the desired result.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe chef has a specific task: cooking a certain number of potatoes, and he's already made some progress by cooking a portion of them. Now, he wants to know how much time it will take to finish cooking the remaining potatoes. This problem involves basic arithmetic calculations, specifically multiplication and subtraction, to determine the cooking time for the remaining potatoes.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the time required to cook the remaining potatoes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cooking time for all 15 potatoes by multiplying the cooking time per potato (8 minutes) by the total number of potatoes.\n2. Subtract the cooking time for the potatoes that have already been cooked (6 potatoes) from the total cooking time.\n3. The result will give us the cooking time needed for the remaining potatoes.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a predicate that calculates the cooking time for the remaining potatoes based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `cooking_time_per_potato(CookingTimePerPotato)` to represent the constant cooking time of 8 minutes for each potato.\n2. Define a predicate `total_cooking_time(TotalPotatoes, CookingTimePerPotato, TotalCookingTime)` to calculate the total cooking time for all potatoes. This predicate multiplies the cooking time per potato by the total number of potatoes.\n3.

He currently has 3 action figures, but he needs a total of 8 to make his collection whole. Each action figure costs $6. The task is to calculate the total amount of money Henry needs to spend to finish his collection.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Henry needs, we can perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the number of action figures Henry still needs: Total needed (8) minus the ones he already has (3), resulting in 5 more action figures needed.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the remaining action figures: Multiply the number of action figures needed (5) by the cost per action figure ($6).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total cost of completing the action figure collection. Our plan will involve defining a predicate that takes into account the number of action figures Henry already has, the total he needs, and the cost per figure. Here's a step-by-step outline:\n\n1.

The question now is, how much money did John actually earn for the lawns he did mow?\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out John's earnings, we need to consider the number of lawns he successfully mowed and the payment he receives per lawn. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Number of Lawns Mowed**: John had 15 lawns to mow but forgot to mow 7 of them, so the number of lawns he actually mowed is the difference between these two numbers.\n2. **Earnings per Lawn**: John earns $8 for each lawn he mows.\n3. **Total Earnings**: To calculate John's total earnings, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed by his earnings per lawn.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates John's total earnings based on the number of lawns he mowed and his earnings per lawn. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. **Define a Rule for Earnings Calculation**: Create a rule named `lawn_earnings` that takes two parameters: the number of lawns mowed (`MowedLawns`) and the earnings per lawn (`EarningsPerLawn`).\n2. **Calculate Number of Lawns Mowed**: Within the `lawn_earnings` rule, subtract the number of forgotten lawns (`ForgottenLawns`) from the total number of lawns (`TotalLawns`) to determine how many lawns John actually mowed (`MowedLawns`).\n3. **Compute Total Earnings**: Multiply the `MowedLawns` by the `EarningsPerLawn` to calculate John's total earnings (`TotalEarnings`).\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\nlawn_earnings(MowedLawns, EarningsPerLawn, TotalEarnings) :-\n    MowedLawns is TotalLawns - ForgottenLawns,\n    TotalEarnings is MowedLawns * EarningsPerLawn.\n\n% Example query to calculate John's earnings\n% ?- lawn_earnings(MowedLawns, 8, TotalEarnings).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the number of lawns mowed and then compute John's total earnings based on that number.

The task is to determine the total number of lives these remaining players collectively possess.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the total number of lives, we need to consider the number of players remaining and the number of lives each of them has:\n\n- Given that 7 players quit out of the initial 10, there are 10 - 7 = 3 players remaining.\n- Each remaining player has 8 lives.\n- To find the total number of lives, we multiply the number of players by the number of lives each player has.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of lives based on the given parameters:\n\n1.

        "question": "Dave had 10 video games but 2 of them weren't working. If he wanted to sell the working games for $4 each, how much money could he earn?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nDave possesses a collection of video games, but unfortunately, some of them are non-functional. Specifically, out of his total of ten video games, two are not in working condition. He intends to sell the operational games for a set price of $4 per game. The problem requires us to calculate the total amount of money Dave can earn from selling these functioning games.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the monetary sum Dave can accumulate through the sale of his operational video games, we undertake the ensuing steps:\n\n- Identify the count of functional games: Given the total of ten games, we subtract the two that are non-operational.\n- Compute the prospective earnings: We multiply the count of functional games by the intended selling price per game, which is $4.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo craft a SWI-Prolog code that adeptly resolves this problem, we can adhere to the ensuing blueprint:\n\n1. **Define a predicate to compute the count of operational games**:\n   - Parameters: Total games, Non-functional games, Functional games.\n   - Relationship: The count of functional games equals the difference between the total games and non-functional games.\n\n2. **Define a predicate to calculate the potential earnings from selling the functional games**:\n   - Parameters: Functional games, Price per game, Total earnings.\n   - Relationship: Total earnings are derived by multiplying the count of functional games by the price per game.\n\n3. **Invoke the predicates with the provided values from the problem**:\n   - Utilize 10 to represent the total video games and 2 for the non-functional games.\n   - Employ $4 as the intended selling price for each functional game.\n\n4. **Employ SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to execute the computations**:\n   - Utilize the arithmetic operator \"*\" to compute the total earnings.\n\n5. **Query the predicates to obtain the result**:\n   - Query SWI-Prolog to compute the potential earnings based on the given parameters.\n\nBy adhering to this systematic plan, we can effectively harness SWI-Prolog's arithmetic and logical inference capabilities to resolve the problem, ultimately ascertaining the monetary amount Dave can earn from selling his operational video games.",

        "question": "Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 11 bars total and Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, how much money would she have made?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nVanessa has a box of chocolate bars, and she wants to sell them. Each chocolate bar in the box costs $4. There are 11 bars in total, but she decides to keep 7 bars for herself and sell the rest. The task is to calculate how much money Vanessa will make from selling these chocolate bars.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how much money Vanessa will make, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the total value of the chocolate bars in the box: Multiply the cost per bar ($4) by the total number of bars (11).\n2. Determine how many chocolate bars Vanessa wants to sell: Subtract the number of bars she wants to keep (7) from the total number of bars (11).\n3. Calculate the revenue from selling the chocolate bars: Multiply the number of bars sold (the difference from step 2) by the cost per bar ($4).\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can create a rule that calculates the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars based on the given cost per bar and the number of bars sold. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `chocolate_revenue` that takes three parameters: the cost per chocolate bar (`CostPerBar`), the initial total number of bars (`TotalBars`), and the number of bars Vanessa wants to keep (`BarsKept`).\n2. Calculate the number of bars sold by subtracting `BarsKept` from `TotalBars`.\n3. Compute the total revenue by multiplying the number of bars sold by the `CostPerBar`.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code might look:\n\n```prolog\nchocolate_revenue(CostPerBar, TotalBars, BarsKept, Revenue) :-\n    BarsSold is TotalBars - BarsKept,\n    Revenue is BarsSold * CostPerBar.\n\n% Example query to calculate revenue\n% ?- chocolate_revenue(4, 11, 7, Revenue).\n% This query should calculate the revenue from selling the chocolate bars.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines a rule that calculates the revenue from selling chocolate bars based on the given parameters.

Calculate the total score by multiplying the number of members present by the points scored per member (9 points).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the total score based on the number of members present and the points scored per member. Here's a structured plan for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a rule `total_score(MembersPresent, PointsPerMember, TotalScore)` that computes the total score. This rule will take the number of members present and the points scored per member as input and output the total score.\n\n2. In the rule, multiply `MembersPresent` by `PointsPerMember` to calculate the `TotalScore`.\n\n3. Instantiate the rule with the given values: 11 total members, 6 absent members (so 5 present), and 9 points per member.\n\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculation and find the `TotalScore`.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the total score\ntotal_score(MembersPresent, PointsPerMember, TotalScore) :-\n    TotalScore is MembersPresent * PointsPerMember.\n\n% Query to find the total score\n% ?- total_score(5, 9, TotalScore).\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a rule `total_score` that computes the total score based on the input parameters. The query at the end will execute the calculation with the given values, resulting in the total score achieved by the team during the game.",

In this case, he has a total of 17 lawns to mow, but he forgets to mow 9 of them. The problem is to calculate how much money Edward actually earns based on the number of lawns he mowed and the rate per lawn.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of lawns Edward actually mowed by subtracting the number of lawns he forgot to mow from the total number of lawns: 17 lawns - 9 lawns = 8 lawns.\n2. Determine Edward's earnings by multiplying the number of lawns he mowed by the rate per lawn: $4 per lawn.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates Edward's earnings based on the given information. Here's a structured plan for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `lawns_mowed(TotalLawns, MissedLawns, ActualLawns)` that calculates the number of lawns Edward actually mowed.

Calculate the total cups of flour used for the 8 brownies: 8 brownies * 8 cups/brownie.\n2. Find out how many more brownies she needs to make: 17 needed - 8 already baked.\n3. Calculate the additional cups of flour required for the remaining brownies by multiplying the number of remaining brownies by the cups of flour per brownie.\n4. Finally, subtract the total cups of flour used from the total cups needed to find out the shortfall.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to create a rule that calculates the number of cups of flour Tiffany still needs. The plan will involve defining predicates for the number of brownies needed, the cups of flour used per brownie, and the total cups required. Then, we can compute the difference to find out the shortfall.\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_flour_used(BrowniesBaked, CupsPerBrownie, TotalUsed)` to calculate the total cups of flour used for the baked brownies.\n2. Define a predicate `brownies_needed(TotalNeeded, Baked, Remaining)` to determine the number of brownies still needed.\n3. Define a predicate `additional_flour_needed(TotalUsed, Remaining, CupsNeeded)` to calculate how many more cups of flour are required.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and logical inference to ensure proper data flow.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the total cups of flour used for the baked brownies\ntotal_flour_used(BrowniesBaked, CupsPerBrownie, TotalUsed) :-\n    TotalUsed is BrowniesBaked * CupsPerBrownie.\n\n% Determine the number of brownies still needed\nbrownies_needed(TotalNeeded, Baked, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is TotalNeeded - Baked.\n\n% Calculate the additional cups of flour required\nadditional_flour_needed(TotalUsed, Remaining, CupsNeeded) :-\n    CupsNeeded is Remaining * CupsPerBrownie - TotalUsed.\n\n% Query to find the number of cups of flour still needed\nquery_flour_needed(CupsNeeded) :-\n    total_flour_used(8, 8, TotalUsed),\n    brownies_needed(17, 8, Remaining),\n    additional_flour_needed(TotalUsed, Remaining, CupsNeeded).\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines the relationships and calculations needed to determine how many more cups of flour Tiffany requires to bake the remaining brownies. The query `query_flour_needed(CupsNeeded)` will compute and return the number of cups of flour she still needs.",

        "question": "Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them, how many points would she have earned?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMegan earns points for recycling bags of cans. Specifically, she earns 8 points for each bag. Initially, she had 14 bags, but she didn't recycle 5 of those bags. To find out how many points she earned, we need to calculate the number of bags she actually recycled and then multiply that by the points earned per bag.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bags Megan recycled. Since she had 14 bags but didn't recycle 5 of them, the number of bags she recycled can be found by subtracting the non-recycled bags from the total: 14 bags - 5 bags = 9 bags recycled.\n2. Determine the total number of points earned. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags recycled by the points earned per bag: 9 bags * 8 points/bag = 72 points.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the total number of points earned based on the given information. Here's an outline of the plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_points(RecycledBags, PointsEarned)` that takes the number of recycled bags and computes the total points earned.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - Calculate the number of recycled bags by subtracting the non-recycled bags from the total bags.\n   - Multiply the number of recycled bags by the points earned per bag to find the total points earned.\n3. Implement the rule and query it with the given values to find the solution:\n   - For example, `total_points(14, RecycledBags, PointsEarned)` will calculate the points earned when Megan had 14 bags and recycled an unknown number of them.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate total points earned\ntotal_points(TotalBags, RecycledBags, PointsEarned) :-\n    RecycledBags is TotalBags - 5,\n    PointsEarned is RecycledBags * 8.\n\n% Query to find the total points earned when Megan had 14 bags\nquery_total_points(PointsEarned) :-\n    total_points(14, _, PointsEarned).\n```\n\nThis code sets up the relationship between the number of bags, the recycled bags, and the points earned.

        "question": "A pet store had 81 puppies. In one day they sold 41 of them and put the rest into cages with 8 in each cage. How many cages did they use?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA pet store initially had 81 puppies, and they sold 41 of them in one day. To house the remaining puppies, they decided to put an equal number of puppies in each cage. If they used 8 puppies per cage, we need to determine how many cages they required for the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of cages used, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining puppies: Start with the initial count of 81 and subtract the sold puppies, i.e., 81 - 41 = 40.\n2. Determine the number of cages needed: Divide the remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage (8). This calculation will give us the number of cages used.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_puppies(Sold, Total, Remaining)` that calculates the number of remaining puppies based on the initial total and the number sold.\n2. Define a predicate `cages_used(Remaining, PuppiesPerCage, CagesUsed)` that computes the number of cages used, given the number of remaining puppies and the number of puppies per cage.\n3.

This problem involves subtraction to find the amount left after buying the game and then division to determine how many toys that remaining amount can purchase.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining amount: Subtract the cost of the game ($49) from Tom's initial amount ($57) to find how much he has left.\n2.

To find out how many bouquets she can still make, we need to calculate the number of flowers remaining after the wilted flowers are accounted for, and then determine how many bouquets of 8 flowers each can be made from that remaining quantity.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of flowers remaining after 10 wilted: 66 - 10 = 56 flowers.\n2. Determine the maximum number of bouquets Isabel can make with 56 flowers by dividing the total flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet: 56 / 8.\n3.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThere are 36 students trying out for the school's trivia teams, but 9 of them didn't make it. The selected students are then divided into three groups. To find out the number of students in each group, we need to calculate the total number of selected students and then divide that by the number of groups.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. Calculate the number of selected students: Total students trying out (36) minus the number of unselected students (9) gives us 36 - 9 = 27 students.\n2. To determine the number of students in each group, we divide the total number of selected students by the number of groups. This can be calculated as 27 / 3.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of students in each group. Here's an outline for the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_selected_students(TotalStudents, Unselected, Selected)` that calculates the number of selected students given the total number of students trying out and the number of unselected students.\n2. Define a predicate `students_per_group(Selected, Groups, StudentsPerGroup)` that calculates the number of students in each group given the total number of selected students and the number of groups.\n3. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n4. Query the `students_per_group` predicate with the given values to find out how many students are in each group.\n\nHere's a sample SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the number of selected students\ntotal_selected_students(TotalStudents, Unselected, Selected) :-\n    Selected is TotalStudents - Unselected.\n\n% Calculate the number of students in each group\nstudents_per_group(Selected, Groups, StudentsPerGroup) :-\n    StudentsPerGroup is Selected // Groups.\n\n% Query to find the number of students in each group\nquery_students_per_group(StudentsPerGroup) :-\n    total_selected_students(36, 9, Selected),\n    students_per_group(Selected, 3, StudentsPerGroup).\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define a predicate `total_selected_students` to calculate the number of selected students. Then, we define `students_per_group` to compute the number of students in each group. Finally, we query `query_students_per_group` to find out how many students are in each group when there are 36 students trying out, 9 are unselected, and the selected students are divided into 3 groups.",

The goal is to determine how many cages the pet store used for the remaining puppies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of cages used, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining puppies: Start with the total initial puppies (64) and subtract the number sold (28) to find how many are left: 64 - 28 = 36.\n2. Determine the number of cages needed: Since each cage holds four puppies, divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies per cage: 36 / 4.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem using SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of cages used.

        "question": "A waiter had 21 customers in his section. If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 3 people at each table, how many tables did he have?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nA waiter in a restaurant has a section with an initial count of 21 customers. Out of these, 12 customers leave, reducing the total count. The remaining customers are distributed across tables, with each table accommodating 3 customers. The task is to determine how many tables the waiter has in their section after the customers leave.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find the number of tables, we need to consider the change in customer count and the distribution of the remaining customers across tables. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Customer Count**: The waiter starts with 21 customers in their section.\n2. **Customer Departure**: Out of these, 12 customers leave, reducing the count by this number.\n3. **Customers at Each Table**: The remaining customers are seated at tables, and each table has a capacity of 3 customers.\n4. **Calculate Number of Tables**: To find the number of tables, we divide the remaining customer count by the number of customers per table.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define a rule that calculates the number of tables the waiter has based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Define Predicates**:\n   - `initial_customers(Count)` to represent the initial number of customers (21 in this case).\n   - `customers_left(LeftCount)` to represent the number of customers who left (12 in this case).\n   - `customers_per_table(NumCustomers)` to represent the number of customers seated at each table (3 in this case).\n   - `number_of_tables(NumTables)` to calculate and represent the final number of tables the waiter has.\n2. **Implement Logic**:\n   - Define rules to calculate the number of tables based on the relationships between the predicates.\n   - Use arithmetic operations to perform calculations, such as subtraction to find the remaining customer count and division to determine the number of tables.\n3. **Test the Implementation**:\n   - Query the `number_of_tables` predicate with the given values to find the number of tables the waiter has after the customers left.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_customers(21).\ncustomers_left(12).\ncustomers_per_table(3).\n\nnumber_of_tables(NumTables) :-\n    initial_customers(TotalCustomers),\n    customers_left(LeftCustomers),\n    RemainingCustomers is TotalCustomers - LeftCustomers,\n    NumTables is RemainingCustomers // customers_per_table.\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships between the initial customer count, the number of customers who left, and the seating capacity of each table. It then calculates the number of tables based on these relationships using arithmetic operations.",

The remaining students were divided into two groups. The task is to determine how many students are in each of these two groups.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who were selected for the trivia teams: Total students trying out (25) minus the number of unselected students (15) = 10 selected students.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nMike has earned some money from mowing lawns over the summer, totaling $42. He then spends $10 on new mower blades, leaving him with a remaining amount of money. The problem is to determine how many $8 games he can buy with this leftover money.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many games Mike can purchase, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the remaining money after buying the mower blades: $42 (total earnings) - $10 (cost of mower blades) = $32.\n2. Determine the number of games Mike can buy with this remaining money by dividing the total remaining money by the cost of each game: $32 / $8 per game.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of games Mike can buy based on his remaining money. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `games_bought` that takes parameters for total earnings, cost of mower blades, cost of each game, and the number of games bought.\n2. Calculate the remaining money after buying mower blades by subtracting the cost of mower blades from total earnings.\n3. Calculate the number of games bought by dividing the remaining money by the cost of each game.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform these calculations and unify the result with the number of games bought.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet based on this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of games bought\ngames_bought(TotalEarnings, MowerBladeCost, GameCost, NumGames) :-\n    RemainingMoney is TotalEarnings - MowerBladeCost,\n    NumGames is floor(RemainingMoney / GameCost).\n\n% Example query to find the number of games Mike can buy\n% ?- games_bought(42, 10, 8, NumGames).\n% This should output the number of games Mike can buy.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of games Mike can purchase using his remaining money, demonstrating how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving basic arithmetic and logical inference.",

Calculate the number of apples distributed to students: 5 apples.\n2. Find out how many apples are left after distributing 5 to students: 50 total apples - 5 distributed = 45 apples.\n3. Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples by dividing the total number of remaining apples by the number of apples needed for each pie: 45 apples / 5 apples per pie.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will be structured to calculate the number of pies that can be made based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule named `pies_from_apples(TotalApples, ApplesPerPie, NumPies)` that takes the total number of apples, the number of apples needed per pie, and calculates the number of pies that can be made.\n2. Calculate the number of apples left after distributing some to students: `RemainingApples is TotalApples - DistributedApples`.\n3. Calculate the number of pies that can be made by dividing the remaining apples by the apples needed per pie: `NumPies is RemainingApples // ApplesPerPie`. Use integer division (`//`) to ensure a whole number of pies.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and unify the result with `NumPies`.\n\nHere's a Prolog code snippet that represents this plan:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of pies from apples\npies_from_apples(TotalApples, ApplesPerPie, NumPies) :-\n    DistributedApples = 5,\n    RemainingApples is TotalApples - DistributedApples,\n    NumPies is RemainingApples // ApplesPerPie.\n\n% Example query to find out how many pies can be made with 50 apples, where each pie needs 5 apples\n% ?- pies_from_apples(50, 5, NumPies).\n% This should output the number of pies that can be made.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently calculates the number of pies that can be made from the remaining apples after some are distributed to students, demonstrating how Prolog can be used to solve practical problems involving basic arithmetic and logical inference.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nRoger has 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He decides to divide them into multiple loads for washing. He starts by putting 48 items in one load, and then he plans to split the remaining clothes into nine equal smaller loads. The task is to determine how many pieces of clothing he can put in each of these small loads.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out how many items Roger can put in each of the small loads, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the total number of items remaining after the first load: Start with the initial total of 120 items and subtract the 48 items in the first load.\n2. Determine the number of items in each small load: Divide the remaining items by the number of small loads (9) to find out how many items go into each load.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of items in each small load. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_items(Total, FirstLoad, Remaining)` to calculate the number of items remaining after the first load:\n   ```prolog\n   remaining_items(Total, FirstLoad, Remaining) :- Remaining is Total - FirstLoad.\n   ```\n\n2.

The problem is to determine how many bouquets she can still make with the remaining healthy flowers.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. **Understand the given information**: Wendy starts with 45 flowers, and each bouquet requires 5 flowers.\n2. **Calculate the number of healthy flowers remaining**: Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total picked flowers: 45 - 35 = 10.\n3. **Determine the number of bouquets that can be made**: Divide the number of healthy flowers by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet (5).

Here's a structured plan:\n\n1. **Define a predicate for the number of bouquets**: Create a predicate `bouquets(TotalFlowers, WiltedFlowers, HealthyFlowers, NumBouquets)` that relates the total number of flowers picked, the number of wilted flowers, the number of healthy flowers remaining, and the number of bouquets that can be made.\n2. **Calculate the number of healthy flowers**: Within the `bouquets` predicate, subtract the wilted flowers from the total flowers to find the number of healthy flowers remaining: `HealthyFlowers is TotalFlowers - WiltedFlowers`.\n3. **Compute the number of bouquets**: Divide the number of healthy flowers by the number of flowers needed for each bouquet and round down to the nearest integer (since partial bouquets are not useful). Use the `floor/2` function to perform this calculation: `NumBouquets is floor(HealthyFlowers / 5)`.\n4. **Test the implementation**: Query the `bouquets` predicate with the given values to determine how many bouquets Wendy can make: `?- bouquets(45, 35, HealthyFlowers, NumBouquets).`\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code will look something like this:\n\n```prolog\nbouquets(TotalFlowers, WiltedFlowers, HealthyFlowers, NumBouquets) :-\n    HealthyFlowers is TotalFlowers - WiltedFlowers,\n    NumBouquets is floor(HealthyFlowers / 5).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationship between the number of flowers, the wilted flowers, and the resulting number of bouquets.

Initially, the waiter had 22 customers, and then 14 of them left. The remaining customers sat at tables with 4 people each. The goal is to find out how many tables the waiter has in their section.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining customers after 14 customers left: Start with 22 customers and subtract 14.\n2. Determine the number of tables by dividing the remaining customers by the number of customers per table (4). This calculation will give us the number of tables the remaining customers are sitting at.\n\n### Plan:\n\nUsing SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to calculate the number of tables the waiter has.\n\n1. Define a predicate `remaining_customers(Initial, Left, Remaining)` to calculate the number of customers remaining after some customers left.\n2. Define a predicate `tables_count(Remaining, CustomersPerTable, TableCount)` to calculate the number of tables based on the number of remaining customers and the customers per table.\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values: Initial customers as 22, Left customers as 14, and Customers per table as 4.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and find the `TableCount`.\n\nHere's a possible SWI-Prolog code snippet:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_customers(Initial, Left, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is Initial - Left.\n\ntables_count(Remaining, CustomersPerTable, TableCount) :-\n    TableCount is Remaining // CustomersPerTable.\n\nwaiter_tables(Initial, Left, CustomersPerTable, TableCount) :-\n    remaining_customers(Initial, Left, Remaining),\n    tables_count(Remaining, CustomersPerTable, TableCount).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates to calculate the remaining customers and the number of tables. By using integer division (`//`), we ensure that only whole numbers of tables are considered. This approach leverages Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve the problem efficiently.",

        "question": "Nancy uploaded 51 pictures to Facebook. She put 11 pics into one album and put the rest into 8 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nNancy has uploaded a total of 51 pictures to Facebook and wants to organize them into albums. She puts 11 pictures into one album and distributes the remaining pictures into 8 other albums. The problem is to determine how many pictures are in each of these 8 albums.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of pictures in each of the 8 albums. This can be done by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums. However, since we already know that one album contains 11 pictures, we need to consider this when calculating the distribution for the other albums.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to calculate the number of pictures in each album based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `total_pictures(TPics)` to represent the total number of pictures Nancy uploaded (51 pictures).\n2. Define a predicate `album_pictures(APics, AlbumNum)` to represent the number of pictures in an album numbered `AlbumNum` (ranging from 1 to 9).\n3. Implement a rule to calculate the number of pictures in the special album with 11 pictures:\n   - Use `album_pictures(11, 1)` to indicate that album number 1 has 11 pictures.\n4. Implement a rule to calculate the number of pictures in the remaining albums:\n   - Subtract the pictures in the special album (11) from the total pictures (51) to find the remaining pictures for distribution.\n   - Divide the remaining pictures by the number of regular albums (8) to find the number of pictures in each regular album.\n5. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical inference to solve for the number of pictures in each album.\n\nThe SWI-Prolog code would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\ntotal_pictures(51).\n\nalbum_pictures(11, 1).\n\nalbum_pictures(APics, AlbumNum) :-\n    total_pictures(TPics),\n    APics is (TPics - 11) // 8,\n    AlbumNum > 1,\n    AlbumNum =< 9.\n\n% Sample query to find the number of pictures in each album\n% ?- album_pictures(APics, AlbumNum).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relationships between the total pictures, the special album, and the regular albums.

The goal is to find out how many players were on Bianca's team, including herself.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo determine the number of players on Bianca's team, we need to consider the points scored by Bianca and the points scored by each of the other players. We can set up an equation to find the unknown number of players:\n\nTotal points - Bianca's points = (Number of other players * Points per player)\n\nWe can then solve for the \"Number of other players\" to find out how many people, including Bianca, were on the team.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of players on Bianca's team based on the given total score and individual scores. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a rule `team_size(BiancaScore, OtherPlayerScore, NumPlayers)` that calculates the total number of players on the team, including Bianca.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nEmily received a total of 54 pieces of candy for Halloween. She indulged in some of her treats, eating 33 pieces. With the remaining candy, she wants to create piles with the same number of pieces in each pile. Specifically, she wants to make piles with 7 pieces in each. To find out how many piles she can make, we need to calculate the number of pieces she has left and then determine how many groups of 7 can be formed from that number.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining pieces of candy after Emily ate some: Total received - Pieces eaten.\n2. Determine the number of piles she can make by dividing the remaining pieces by the desired number of pieces in each pile (7).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of piles Emily can make based on the given information.

        "question": "The cafeteria had 86 apples. For lunch they handed out 30 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make?",
        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nThe cafeteria initially had 86 apples and distributed 30 apples to students during lunch. To find out how many pies they can make with the remaining apples, we need to calculate the number of apples left and then determine how many pies can be made from those apples, given that each pie requires 8 apples.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the number of apples left after distributing 30 to students: 86 apples - 30 apples = 56 apples.\n2. Determine how many pies can be made with 56 apples by dividing the total apples by the number of apples required per pie (8 apples).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe will use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of pies that can be made based on the initial count of apples and the number of apples used for other purposes. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Define a predicate `initial_apples(Count)` to represent the initial count of apples (86).\n2. Define a predicate `apples_used(Count)` to represent the number of apples used for other purposes (30).\n3. Define a predicate `apples_remaining(Initial, Used, Remaining)` to calculate the number of apples remaining after using some for other purposes.\n4. Define a predicate `apples_per_pie(Count)` to represent the number of apples required for one pie (8).\n5. Define a predicate `pies_made(Remaining, ApplesPerPie, Pies)` to calculate the number of pies that can be made with the remaining apples.\n6. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations and logical inference to relate the predicates.\n\nHere's an outline of the SWI-Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\ninitial_apples(86).\napples_used(30).\n\napples_remaining(Initial, Used, Remaining) :-\n    Remaining is Initial - Used.\n\napples_per_pie(8).\n\npies_made(Remaining, ApplesPerPie, Pies) :-\n    Pies is Remaining // ApplesPerPie.\n\ncafeteria_pies(Pies) :-\n    initial_apples(Initial),\n    apples_used(Used),\n    apples_remaining(Initial, Used, Remaining),\n    apples_per_pie(ApplesPerPie),\n    pies_made(Remaining, ApplesPerPie, Pies).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we define predicates for each step of the calculation, using SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` and `//`) for calculations involving integers. The final predicate, `cafeteria_pies`, ties everything together to compute the number of pies the cafeteria can make with the remaining apples.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nJerry has 60 pieces of clothing to wash and wants to divide them into loads for washing. He starts by putting 40 items in one load, which leaves him with 20 items (60 - 40 = 20). He then decides to split the remaining 20 items into 5 equal loads. To find out how many items are in each of the small loads, we need to divide the remaining number of items by the number of loads.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following calculations:\n1. Calculate the number of items remaining after the first load: 60 items - 40 items = 20 items.\n2. Divide the remaining items by the number of small loads: 20 items / 5 loads.\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to calculate the number of items in each small load. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Define a predicate `items_per_load(TotalItems, ItemsPerLoad, NumLoads, RemainingItems)` to calculate the number of items in each load. This predicate will take the total number of items, the number of items in the first load, the number of small loads, and calculate the remaining items and items per load.\n2. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations:\n   - Subtract the items in the first load from the total items to get the `RemainingItems`.\n   - Calculate `ItemsPerLoad` by dividing `RemainingItems` by `NumLoads`.\n3. Query the `items_per_load` predicate with the given values to find out how many items are in each small load.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code would look:\n\n```prolog\nitems_per_load(TotalItems, ItemsPerLoad, NumLoads, RemainingItems) :-\n    RemainingItems is TotalItems - ItemsPerLoad,\n    ItemsPerLoad is RemainingItems // NumLoads.\n\n% Query to find the number of items in each small load\n% ?- items_per_load(60, 40, 5, RemainingItems), ItemsPerLoad is RemainingItems // 5.\n```\n\nThis SWI-Prolog code defines a predicate that calculates the number of items in each small load based on the total items, items in the first load, and the number of small loads.

Define a rule `remaining_puppies(InitialPuppies, SoldPuppies, RemainingPuppies)` that calculates the number of remaining puppies after selling a certain number of puppies.\n2. Define a rule `cages_used(RemainingPuppies, PuppiesPerCage, NumCages)` that calculates the number of cages used, given the number of remaining puppies and the number of puppies per cage.\n3. Instantiate the predicates with the given values: InitialPuppies as 88, SoldPuppies as 34, and PuppiesPerCage as 6.\n4. Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and find the value of `NumCages`.\n\nHere's how the SWI-Prolog code would look:\n\n```prolog\nremaining_puppies(InitialPuppies, SoldPuppies, RemainingPuppies) :-\n    RemainingPuppies is InitialPuppies - SoldPuppies.\n\ncages_used(RemainingPuppies, PuppiesPerCage, NumCages) :-\n    NumCages is RemainingPuppies // PuppiesPerCage.\n\n% Sample query to find the number of cages used\n% ?- remaining_puppies(88, 34, Remaining), cages_used(Remaining, 6, NumCages).\n```\n\nIn this plan, we use Prolog's arithmetic operations (`is` and `//`) to perform the necessary calculations. The `remaining_puppies` predicate calculates the remaining puppies after some are sold, and the `cages_used` predicate determines the number of cages needed for the remaining puppies. The query at the end will execute these calculations and provide the number of cages used for the remaining puppies.",

        "plan": "### Explanation:\n\nKatie initially had 85 files on her computer. She then deleted 40 of those files, reducing the total number of remaining files. She wants to organize the remaining files into folders, with each folder containing 5 files. The goal is to determine how many folders Katie will need to accommodate all the remaining files.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo find out the number of folders Katie will need, we need to perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Calculate the number of remaining files after Katie deletes some of them: Start with 85 files and subtract the 40 files she deleted.\n2. Determine the number of folders needed: Divide the total number of remaining files by the number of files that can fit in each folder (5 files per folder).\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe can use SWI-Prolog to define a rule that calculates the number of folders Katie will need. The plan involves creating a predicate that takes the initial number of files, the number of deleted files, and the number of files per folder as input, and then computes the required number of folders.\n\n1.

Define a predicate `folders_needed(RemainingFiles, FilesPerFolder, NumFolders)` that computes the number of folders needed: `NumFolders is ceil(RemainingFiles / FilesPerFolder)`. Here, `ceil` is used to round up the result to the nearest integer since we want to ensure all files are accommodated.\n3.
