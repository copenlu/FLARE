                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that a week ago it was September 1, 2021. If it was September 1, 2021, a week ago, then today is September 8, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. From this information, we can deduce that today is May 1, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today, given that today is April 19, 1969. Since there are no special conditions like a month or year transition, the date 24 hours later would simply be April 20, 1969. This can be represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this specific case since April has 30 days. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that the year 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future, which means it will be January 1, 2015, in 12 hours. Therefore, today is December 30, 2014. One week from today would be January 6, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the new year transition from December to January. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to December 30, 2014, should result in January 6, 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation."

Given that today is March 12, 2002, the date 24 hours later would be March 13, 2002. This can be represented as 03/13/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day. This involves understanding the month-day boundaries and handling the transition from one day to the next. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 12, then the next date should be March 13, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 31, the next date should be April 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., March 12 to March 13), month-end transitions (e.g., March 31 to April 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion."

For instance, if the date is May 1, the previous date should be April 30 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-Start Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the start of March, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-start and year-start transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., April 30 to April 29), month-start transitions (e.g., May 1 to April 30), and year-start transitions (e.g., January 1 to December 31).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date that was yesterday based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions.

This function should handle month-end transitions by incrementing the month and resetting the day to 1 when necessary.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to April 30, 2021, should result in May 7, 2021.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date one week from today based on the input date, handling both simple and complex date transitions. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities.",

In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 8 (August) and `DD` is 3, then the next date should be August 4, 1997.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is August 31, the next date should be September 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., August 3 to August 4), month-end transitions (e.g., August 31 to September 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

Since Jane was born on February 28, 2001, her 16th birthday would be on February 28, 2017. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to February 28, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days ahead of a given date. In this case, we need to add seven days to February 28, 2017, to find the date one week from today. The key is to handle the transition between months and potentially years if the addition spans over such boundaries. Prolog can be used to manage these calculations by defining rules for incrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle increments in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Addition of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to add a specified number of days to a given date. In this case, we want to add seven days to February 28, 2017, to find the date one week from today.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when adding days. This includes adjusting the month and day based on the number of days in each month.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day addition rule repeatedly, incrementing the count until it reaches the desired number of days.\n   - This will handle the addition of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive addition to accurately compute the date one week from today.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as adding days to January 31st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the addition of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days ahead of a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. Consider the transition to the previous month if necessary.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from January 2, 1958, should result in January 1, 1958.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. Adjust the month and day based on the number of days in each month.\n   - Account for special cases like February and leap years to ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This recursive approach will handle the subtraction of 10 days, potentially crossing month boundaries.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which is essential for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Prolog Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching capabilities to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the program follows the correct path in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from the beginning of a year or during leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of 10 days and produces the expected result.\n\nBy following this plan, a Prolog program can be developed to calculate the date that was 10 days ago from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, managing month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to determine the desired date.",

In Prolog, we can create rules to swap the day and month components of the date representation to achieve the desired format conversion.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations for rearranging the day and month components.\n\n2. **Date Format Conversion Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to convert the date format from DD/MM/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY. This rule should swap the day and month components while keeping the year unchanged.\n\n3. **Handling Day and Month Ranges:**\n   - Ensure that the day and month components are within valid ranges. For example, the month should be between 1 and 12, and the day should be valid for the corresponding month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to handle leap years when converting the date format. Leap years affect the number of days in February.\n\n5. **Prolog Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to match the input date format and apply the conversion rule effectively.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases with various dates to verify that the date format conversion rule works correctly for different scenarios, including leap years and edge cases.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can convert dates from the UK format (DD/MM/YYYY) to the US format (MM/DD/YYYY) by rearranging the day and month components while preserving the year.

The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from January 2, 1987, would land in the previous month, December. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions while considering the UK date format.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nIn the UK date format, the day comes before the month. Given that today is represented as 02/01/1987 (January 2, 1987), the task is to determine the date one week ago from today. This involves subtracting seven days from the current date to find the date that corresponds to one week prior, considering month and year transitions. \n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the calculation of a date that is one week (7 days) before a given date, considering the day-month-year format used in the UK. This requires understanding how to decrement days while accounting for month-end transitions and potential year changes. Prolog can be used to implement rules for date arithmetic and manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day by 7 days, considering month-end transitions. If the day reaches 0, it should roll over to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. Ensure that the month and year are adjusted correctly based on the current date.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle February dates and ensure the correct number of days in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (7 days in this case) by repeatedly applying the single-day decrement rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the decrement rules and handle month and year transitions effectively based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one week ago for different scenarios, including month-end transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately computes the date one week ago from a given date in the UK format, considering all necessary transitions and special cases such as month-end and year changes.

        "question": "Jane booked a flight for tomorrow, Jul 29, 2002. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from July 29, 2002, which is the day Jane booked a flight for. Adding 24 hours to July 29, 2002, will result in July 30, 2002. This can be represented as 07/30/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day, considering the month and year boundaries. In this case, the increment does not cross the month boundary, so the calculation is straightforward. Prolog can be used to handle this by defining rules for date arithmetic and ensuring the correct date is calculated.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule or function to increment the day by 1 within the same month. If the day is the last day of the month, the month should increment, and the day should reset to 1. If the month is December and the day is 31, the year should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add 24 Hours Function:**\n   - Develop a function that adds 24 hours to a given date. This function should call the increment day function as needed to handle the day, month, and year transitions.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within the increment day function to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in the increment day function to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of adding 24 hours to July 29, 2002, and verify that the result is July 30, 2002.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date 24 hours later from a given date, handling all necessary transitions and special cases effectively.

The calculation needs to consider the month and year boundaries, as well as the specific starting date provided. In this case, we need to increment the date by 7 days to find the date one week from today. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for date arithmetic and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, given that Jane ate 2 pizzas and 5 wings on January 21, 2011. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current date. This involves considering leap years and handling the transition from one year to the previous year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date that is one year prior to a given date. It involves understanding how to decrement the year while considering leap years. In this case, subtracting one year from the current date of January 21, 2011, would result in January 21, 2010. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for year decrementation and considering leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in years.\n\n2. **Decrement Year Function:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This rule should handle leap years correctly by considering whether the current year is a leap year.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year. Leap years have an extra day in February, so this check is essential for correctly handling the transition from one year to the previous year.\n\n4. **Year Transition Logic:**\n   - Define logic to handle the transition from December to January when decrementing the year. Ensure that the month and day values are adjusted accordingly.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to determine the correct logic for year decrementation based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify that the year decrementation rule works correctly for different scenarios, including leap years and transitions between December and January.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Develop a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date one year prior. Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one year ago from the input date, considering leap years and correctly handling the transition between years.

If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from January 21, 2011, should result in January 20, 2011.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes adjusting the month and day values accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like January and leap years should be considered.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of 7 days, transitioning through multiple days, months, or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from the beginning of a month or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of 7 days from various dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date 7 days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to June 18, 2019, should result in June 25, 2019.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one week from the given date, handling month and year transitions effectively. This will provide a robust solution for date calculations using SWI-Prolog's capabilities.",

If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day (e.g., moving from March 31 to February), adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months or calculating dates.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the month subtraction process, considering month-end transitions and year adjustments.\n\n6. **Prolog Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to match the correct rules based on the input date and efficiently handle the month subtraction.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different scenarios, such as subtracting one month from various dates, handling month transitions, and ensuring the correct date calculation.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one month prior to June 19, 2019, considering month and year transitions as needed.

        "question": "May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, but that is actually ten years ago. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that May 6, 1992, is considered like yesterday to Jane, but it is actually ten years ago. This means that the current date is ten years after May 6, 1992. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we first need to calculate the current date based on the information that May 6, 1992, is ten years ago. Once we have the current date, we can then add seven days to find the date one week from today. This involves handling year transitions and ensuring that the month and day are adjusted correctly. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation rules and logic to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding days and adjusting month and year values.\n\n2. **Calculate Current Date:**\n   - Calculate the current date by adding ten years to May 6, 1992. This involves incrementing the year by ten while keeping the month and day the same.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a rule to add a specified number of days to a given date. This rule should handle month-end transitions and adjust the month and year as needed.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. Ensure that the day count is adjusted correctly and that the month and year values are updated accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years when adding days to ensure that February is handled correctly.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add multiple days (in this case, seven days) to the current date. The rule should continue adding days until the total number of days has been added.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to match the correct rules for date manipulation based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one week from the current date, considering month-end transitions, year changes, and leap years.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one week from the current date, handling all necessary date adjustments and transitions effectively.",

In Prolog, we can define rules for incrementing dates, handling month-end transitions, and checking for palindrome dates to determine the next date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date increments and transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the current date by one day to find the date tomorrow.\n   - This rule should handle transitions between days, months, and years appropriately.\n\n3. **Palindrome Date Check:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given date is a palindrome date in the MMDDYYYY format.\n   - This rule should compare the date in both directions to determine if it reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n4. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between months when incrementing the date.\n   - Ensure that the day is correctly adjusted when transitioning to the next month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Check for leap years to handle February correctly when incrementing dates.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the rules for date increments and palindrome date checks efficiently.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly identifies palindrome dates and calculates the date tomorrow based on the current palindrome date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can determine the date that comes after a palindrome date by incrementing the current date by one day.

A palindrome day occurs when the date in MMDDYYYY format reads the same forwards and backwards. Since today is a palindrome day in 2020, we can assume that the date is February 2, 2020 (02/02/2020).

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from the last day of 1899. Since December 31, 1899, is the last day of the year, going back 10 days would result in December 21, 1899. This can be represented as 12/21/1899 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date, considering month and year transitions. In this case, subtracting 10 days from December 31, 1899, requires moving into the previous month, December, and adjusting the year if necessary. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from December 1, 1899, should result in November 30, 1899.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes adjusting the month and day based on the number of days in each month.\n   - Special cases for December and year-end transitions should be considered.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which may be necessary for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that a concert scheduled for June 1, 1943, was delayed by one day to today. This means that today's date is June 2, 1943. To find the date one week ago, we need to calculate the date that is seven days prior to June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle date calculations that involve subtracting days from a given date. In this case, we are subtracting seven days to find the date one week ago. This requires understanding how to handle month and year transitions when subtracting days. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic and manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations that subtract days from dates.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the previous day. If `DD` is 1, then `MM` should decrement, and `DD` should be set to the last day of the previous month. If `MM` is January and `DD` is 1, then `MM` should be set to December, `DD` to 31, and `YYYY` should decrement by 1.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `decrement_day` to subtract a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `decrement_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the previous year, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `decrement_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `subtract_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, subtracting 7 days from June 2, 1943, should result in May 26, 1943.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days in the past, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years.

If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from May 1, 2004, should result in April 30, 2004.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nBy following this plan, a Prolog program can be developed to accurately calculate the date that was 10 days ago from the given current date and time, considering month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation.",

If `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement. \n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

This will lead us to November 13, 1933, which can be represented as 11/13/1933 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the calculation of a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. This involves understanding the concept of day subtraction and ensuring that the date transitions are correctly managed, especially when moving across month boundaries. In this case, we are subtracting 10 days from November 23, 1933, which requires considering the end of the month and potential year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Day Decrement Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 10. If the resulting day is less than 1, adjust the month and year accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting 10 days from November 23, 1933, should result in November 13, 1933.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year when necessary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day decrements (e.g., November 23 to November 13), month-end transitions (e.g., November 1 to October 31), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 10 days prior to a given date, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date decrements and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that a meeting scheduled for 11 am tomorrow is on October 16, 1924. This means that today is October 15, 1924. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to October 15, 1924. This will result in October 22, 1924.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the addition of days to a given date, considering month boundaries and potential year transitions. In this case, we are adding a week to the current date, which may involve moving into the next month or year. Prolog can be used to implement rules for date arithmetic and manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and transitions between months and years.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day by a specified number of days. This rule should handle month-end transitions by moving to the next month when necessary.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should use the increment day rule to handle each day addition.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the increment day rule to check for month-end transitions. If the day exceeds the number of days in the month, increment the month and reset the day to 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February dates when adding days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, ensuring that month and year transitions are managed correctly.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date and the number of days to add.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the function correctly calculates the date one week from the given date, considering different month lengths, year transitions, and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week from a given date, handling all necessary date transitions and special cases effectively.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the current date, given that it was September 1st, 2021, a week ago. To find the current date, we need to add a week (7 days) to September 1st, 2021. This will lead us to September 8th, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days ahead of a given date. In this case, adding a week to September 1st, 2021, will result in September 8th, 2021. The calculation needs to consider month boundaries and potential year changes. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for incrementing days and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle increments in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Addition of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to add a single day to a given date. If the day is the last day of the month, the rule should correctly identify the first day of the next month.\n   - For example, adding one day to September 1st, 2021, should result in September 2nd, 2021.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when adding days. This includes considering the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day addition rule repeatedly, incrementing the count until it reaches the desired number of days.\n   - This will handle the addition of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive addition to accurately compute the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as adding days to December 31st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the addition of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating the current date based on a given date and the number of days to add, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day addition, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from Jane and John's 5-year anniversary, which is January 2, 1958. To find the date 10 days prior to their anniversary, we need to subtract 10 days from January 2, 1958. This calculation will lead us to December 23, 1957, represented as 12/23/1957 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the decrement of days while considering month-end transitions. Subtracting 10 days from a given date involves understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the date accordingly. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle day decrements, month transitions, and year adjustments to accurately determine the date 10 days prior to a given date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day decrements and month transitions.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 10 while staying within the same month. For example, if the date is January 2, 1958, the date 10 days prior should be December 23, 1957.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions when the day decrements cross the boundary of a month. Ensure that the day is adjusted correctly when moving to the previous month.\n\n4. **Year Adjustment Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the previous year if the month is January and the day decrements into the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle February dates when decrementing days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the decrement of days, considering month-end transitions and year adjustments as needed.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the input date and ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting 10 days from different dates, covering month-end transitions and year adjustments.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 10 days prior to a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008. Adding one week to this date will result in April 7, 2008.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how to increment the day while considering month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the transition from March to April. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to March 31, 2008, should result in April 7, 2008.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years.
