                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today, given that today is April 19, 1969. Since there are no special conditions like a month or year transition, the date 24 hours later would simply be April 20, 1969. This can be represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this specific case since April has 30 days. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions."

Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

The key is to recognize that the date rolls over to January 1 of the following year. This requires understanding both month-day boundaries and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to correctly identify when the transition to a new month and year should occur.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage both day and month increments as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should change the month to January (`MM` becomes 1), the day to 1, and increment the year (`YYYY` increases by 1).\n\n3. **Normal Case:**\n   - Write a rule that simply increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month and handles month transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between different months, recognizing that different months have different numbers of days (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days, etc.).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to determine if the year is a leap year to correctly handle February dates.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle day, month, and year transitions, making sure that the correct logic is applied depending on the date structure.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s built-in search to correctly apply rules and pattern matching, ensuring the correct date is selected when moving from one day to the next.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct transition from December 31 to January 1 across different years, including both non-leap and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately determines the date \"today\" based on the input, handling both regular and boundary cases like year transitions."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that the year 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future, which means it will be January 1, 2015, in 12 hours. Therefore, today is December 30, 2014. One week from today would be January 6, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the new year transition from December to January. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to December 30, 2014, should result in January 6, 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation."

Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date. Since December 31 is the last day of the year, subtracting seven days means we need to go back into the previous month, December, and find the date that corresponds to seven days before December 31.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting days. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering the transition between months. For example, if `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve recursive logic and careful consideration of month and year boundaries."

If it was September 1, 2021, a week ago, then today is September 8, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

Given that today is March 12, 2002, the date 24 hours later would be March 13, 2002. This can be represented as 03/13/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day. This involves understanding the month-day boundaries and handling the transition from one day to the next. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 12, then the next date should be March 13, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 31, the next date should be April 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., March 12 to March 13), month-end transitions (e.g., March 31 to April 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions.

In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day decrements and check for month-start transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Normal Day Decrement:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the first day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 30, then the previous date should be April 29, 2021.\n\n3. **Month-Start Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the first day of the month. For instance, if the date is May 1, the previous date should be April 30 of the same year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-start transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day decrements (e.g., April 30 to April 29), month-start transitions (e.g., May 1 to April 30), and leap year considerations.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date of yesterday based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month transitions.

This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from yesterday, which was April 30, 2021. Since there are no special conditions like a month or year transition, the date 24 hours later would simply be May 1, 2021. This can be represented as 05/01/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this specific case since April has 30 days. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 30, the next date should be May 1, 2021.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from November 12, 2019, which is tomorrow. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from November 12, 2019. This calculation will lead us to November 5, 2019, which can be represented as 11/05/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days to find the date one week ago. This involves understanding the number of days in each month and correctly decrementing the date while considering month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can define rules for day subtraction, handle month-end transitions, and ensure the correct date calculation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day decrements and transitions between months and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract 7 days from a given date to find the date one week ago. For example, subtracting 7 days from November 12, 2019, should result in November 5, 2019.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when subtracting days. Ensure that the day and month are adjusted correctly, considering the varying number of days in each month.\n\n4. **Year Transition:**\n   - Include rules to handle the transition to the previous year if necessary. For example, subtracting days from January 1st should result in December 31st of the previous year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to subtract multiple days (in this case, 7 days) from the given date. This recursive approach will handle the decrementing of days until the desired date is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the correct rules for day and month transitions, ensuring the accurate calculation of the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different dates to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one week ago, considering month-end transitions and year boundaries.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one week ago from a given date, handling month and year transitions effectively. This will provide a robust solution for date calculations using SWI-Prolog's capabilities.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from August 3, 1997. Given that today is August 3, 1997, the date 24 hours later would be August 4, 1997. This can be represented as 08/04/1997 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day to find the date 24 hours later. This involves understanding the month-day boundaries and handling the transition from one day to the next. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 8 (August) and `DD` is 3, then the next date should be August 4, 1997.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is August 31, the next date should be September 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., August 3 to August 4), month-end transitions (e.g., August 31 to September 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001 and today is her 16th birthday. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday would be on February 28, 2001. Adding 16 years to this date brings us to February 28, 2017. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be March 1, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is one day after the 16th birthday of Jane. This involves understanding the date of birth, adding 16 years to it, and then finding the date following that. Handling leap years and month transitions is crucial in this calculation. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage these date calculations efficiently.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's Birthday:**\n   - Determine Jane's birthday based on the information provided (February 28, 2001).\n\n3. **Add 16 Years:**\n   - Add 16 years to Jane's birthday to find the date of her 16th birthday (February 28, 2017).\n\n4. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function should handle month-end transitions and leap years.\n\n5. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month and adjust the month and year accordingly.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n8. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from Jane's 16th birthday date (February 28, 2017).\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correctness of the date calculation, especially for month-end transitions and leap years.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date for tomorrow based on Jane's 16th birthday date, considering month and year transitions and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is today. Given that they married on January 2, 1958, their golden anniversary would be January 2, 2008. To find the date 10 days before this anniversary, we need to calculate the date that is 10 days prior to January 2, 2008.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the calculation of a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. In this case, we are subtracting 10 days from January 2, 2008. This involves understanding how to decrement the day while considering month and year transitions. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic and manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from January 2, 2008, should result in January 1, 2008.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for February and leap years should be considered.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Include rules to handle the transition to the previous year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, 10 days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately compute the date that was 10 days ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the current date, which marks Jane's 3-year work anniversary from the day she started her job in 2016. Given that Jane spilled coffee on her laptop on her second day at work, which was December 2, we can calculate the current date by adding 3 years to the starting date. This will help us identify the date that marks her 3-year work anniversary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle date arithmetic by adding 3 years to the starting date. This involves incrementing the year by 3 while keeping the month and day the same.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is represented as 02/01/1987 in the UK date format (day/month/year). To calculate the date one week ahead, we need to increment the current date by seven days. Therefore, one week from today would be February 8, 1987, in the UK date format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the increment of days while considering the month boundaries and potential transitions between months. In this case, the calculation involves adding seven days to the current date. Understanding how to manage these transitions and adjustments is crucial for accurately determining the date one week ahead. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic and handle these calculations effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (day/month/year).\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 7 to calculate the date one week ahead.\n   - Consider month-end transitions and adjust the month and year accordingly.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition when the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n   - Update the month and day appropriately, considering different month lengths.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is December and the day increment crosses into the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Check for leap years to correctly handle February dates, especially when adding days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the increment of days, ensuring that the correct month and year transitions are applied.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to match the correct rules based on the input date and apply the necessary transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one week ahead for different input dates, including month-end and year-end scenarios.\n\nBy following this plan, a Prolog program can be developed to accurately determine the date one week ahead based on the input date in the UK date format.

If the day is the last day of the month, it should transition to the next month.\n   - For example, incrementing July 29, 2002, should result in July 30, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n   - Ensure that the month and day are adjusted correctly when transitioning to the next month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is December and the day increment crosses into the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, especially when handling February, to ensure the correct number of days in the month.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day increment rule repeatedly to add 24 hours to the given date.\n   - Ensure that the correct transitions are made between days, months, and years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the correct rules for day increments and transitions based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different dates to verify that the program correctly handles day increments, month transitions, and year transitions when adding 24 hours.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that accurately computes the date 24 hours later based on the given input date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions and utilizing Prolog's search capabilities for pattern matching and rule application.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that Jane thought today was March 11, 2002, but it is actually March 12, 2002. Since today is March 12, 2002, the date tomorrow would be March 13, 2002. This can be represented as 03/13/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one day to the next. In this case, we are given the current date and need to calculate the date for the following day. This involves understanding the concept of incrementing a day and handling month-end transitions. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage day increments and correctly handle transitions between days, months, and years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 to calculate the date for the following day. For example, if today is March 12, 2002, the date tomorrow would be March 13, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 31, the next date should be April 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., March 12 to March 13), month-end transitions (e.g., March 31 to April 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date for tomorrow based on the given input date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the current date, given that today is April 10, 1985, and Jane's appointment will be 3 days later. To find the current date, we need to subtract 3 days from the appointment date. This involves handling day decrements within the same month and potentially transitioning to the previous month if necessary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date 3 days prior to the appointment date. This requires understanding the number of days in each month, handling month transitions, and ensuring the year is adjusted correctly if needed.

Adjust the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, 3 days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the current date based on the given appointment date and the specified number of days before the appointment.

This task involves handling simple day increments and ensuring the correct date is selected.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Correct Date Selection:**\n   - Write a rule to determine the correct date based on Jane's assertion. Since Jane is correct, the date should be June 18, 2019.\n\n3. **Handling Day Increments:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. In this case, June 18, 2019, should transition to June 19, 2019.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to handle leap years, especially when transitioning from February to March.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to ensure the correct date is selected based on Jane's assertion.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the correct date is determined based on the given information, considering different scenarios and potential discrepancies.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will accurately determine the date today based on Jane's correct assertion, handling day increments and potential leap year considerations.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task involves determining the date one week ago from June 18, 2019, as confirmed by Jane. John's belief that today is June 19, 2019, is incorrect. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from June 18, 2019, which would lead us to June 11, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days while considering the transition between months. In this case, we are subtracting a fixed number of days (seven days) from the given date. The logic involves decrementing the day count while ensuring that the month and year are adjusted correctly when necessary. Prolog can be used to implement rules for day subtraction and manage month and year transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day decrements and month and year adjustments.\n\n2. **Subtracting Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a day from the date, considering month boundaries. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes adjusting the month and day values accordingly.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (seven days in this case). The rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle February dates when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month boundaries, ensuring that the program handles different scenarios accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately computes the date one week ago from a given date, considering transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic and transitions to accurately compute the desired date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations for day increments and decrements.\n\n2. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - Calculate today's date based on the information that May 6, 1992, is ten years ago. This gives us May 6, 2002, as today's date.\n\n3. **Subtract One Week:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract seven days from the given date to find the date one week ago. For example, subtracting seven days from May 6, 2002, would result in April 29, 2002.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. Ensure that the day, month, and year are adjusted correctly based on the current date.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, especially when transitioning between February and other months, to ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days, such as subtracting seven days to find the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the correct rules for date arithmetic and transitions based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one week ago from different starting dates, considering month-end transitions and leap years.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one week ago from the given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as month and year adjustments. This will provide a robust solution for date calculations using Prolog's capabilities.",

In this case, subtracting 10 days from December 24, 1937, requires considering the transition to the previous month if necessary.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should handle the transition to the previous month if the subtraction crosses month boundaries.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. Adjust the month and day values accordingly based on the number of days in each month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, especially when handling February dates, to ensure the correct number of days is accounted for.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, 10 days) from the given date. This rule should handle month transitions and decrement the day count appropriately.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching capabilities to apply the correct rules for date subtraction based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date 10 days prior to Christmas Eve of 1937, considering month transitions and potential year changes.\n\nBy following this plan, a Prolog program can be created to accurately determine the date that was 10 days ago from a given date, handling month transitions and leap years effectively.

Prolog can be used to implement rules for day subtraction and manage transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the given date. If the day is the first day of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from December 31, 1899, should result in December 30, 1899.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between days, months, and years when subtracting days. Ensure that the month and year are adjusted correctly when necessary.\n   - Special consideration should be given to the transition from December to January of the next year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract a single day from the given date.

If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly.

The key is to handle the increment of days while considering month and year transitions. In this case, adding 7 days to July 9, 1972, will result in the date one week later. Prolog can be used to manage these calculations by defining rules for date increments and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day by 7 to calculate the date one week from the given date. For example, if the input date is July 9, 1972, the output date should be July 16, 1972.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. Ensure that the day, month, and year values are adjusted correctly based on the current date.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, especially when calculating dates that involve February. This will ensure that February is handled correctly in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date one week from the given date. This recursive approach will increment the day by 1 for each iteration until 7 days have been added.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one week from various input dates, covering different months, years, and potential month and year transitions.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one week from the given date, handling month and year transitions effectively. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog's capabilities.",

If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from May 4, 2004, should result in May 3, 2004.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes adjusting the month and day values accordingly.\n   - Special consideration should be given to the end of the year, where transitioning from January to December requires decrementing the year as well.\n\n4. **Subtracting One Month:**\n   - Develop a rule to subtract one month from a given date. This rule should handle cases where the current month is January, requiring a transition to December of the previous year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Create a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly to subtract a total of 30 days (one month).\n   - Ensure that the correct month and year transitions are handled during the recursive process.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for month and day transitions.\n   - Ensure that the program can accurately compute the date one month ago from the given input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different dates to verify that the program correctly handles month transitions, year changes, and the subtraction of one month.\n\nBy following this plan, a Prolog program can be developed to determine the date that was one month ago from the given input date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day and month subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to calculate the desired date.",

In this case, the date transition is straightforward as we are only moving to the next day within the same month and year. Prolog can be used to define rules for incrementing the day and handling any necessary adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day by 1 to calculate the date of the following day.\n   - Ensure that the rule correctly handles the transition to the next month if the day is the last day of the current month.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month if the day is the last day of the current month.\n   - Ensure that the month and day are adjusted accordingly when transitioning to the next month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which may affect the number of days in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - While not necessary for this specific task, consider implementing recursive rules for more complex date calculations that involve multiple days or month transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the date calculation for tomorrow is accurate, especially when transitioning between months and years.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date of tomorrow based on the input date, handling day increments and month transitions effectively.

        "question": "Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. Since December has only 31 days, today cannot be December 32, 1929. Therefore, today is January 1, 1930. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to January 1, 1930.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on the current date and a specified interval (one week). The challenge includes handling month boundaries and potentially transitioning to a new month or year. In this case, adding 7 days to January 1, 1930, may involve transitioning to a new month or year. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for date arithmetic and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, `DD` should reset to 1, and `YYYY` should increment if transitioning to a new year.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a specified number of days. It should decrement `Days` each time until reaching 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to January 1, 1930, should result in January 8, 1930.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation.",

        "question": "The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the day before yesterday, which was November 23, 1933. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to increment the date by one day. Therefore, the date 24 hours later from November 23, 1933, would be November 24, 1933.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple increment of the day by one within the same month and year. Since the input date is provided, the task is to increment the day to find the date 24 hours later. The logic involves ensuring that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this case. Prolog can handle this straightforward calculation with a rule that increments the day by one.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if the input date is November 23, 1933, the next date should be November 24, 1933.\n\n3. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule that calculates the date 24 hours later by incrementing the day. This rule should handle the transition to the next day within the same month.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly handles day increments within the same month and year, ensuring the date calculation is accurate.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date 24 hours later from the given input date, handling the increment of the day within the same month and year effectively. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities.",

Given that today's meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, October 16, 1924, we can deduce that today is October 15, 1924.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from the last day of January 2012. Since January has 31 days, going back one month from January 31 would lead to December 31, 2011. Therefore, the date a month ago from the last day of January 2012 is December 31, 2011, which can be represented as 12/31/2011 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another when subtracting a month from a given date. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating dates based on the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day (e.g., moving from January 31 to February), adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n4. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date one month ago. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in matching the correct rules based on the input date and handling exceptions like leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months or calculating dates.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different months and years to ensure the month subtraction rule works correctly and handles all scenarios, including end-of-year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before a given date, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively.

Ensure that the day count is adjusted correctly when moving from one month to the next.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if necessary. This rule should increment the year when the month transitions from December to January.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that is one week from today, given that it was September 1st, 2021, a week ago. This means that today is September 8th, 2021. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to September 8th, 2021, which will give us September 15th, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from the current date. This involves understanding how to increment the day by 7 while considering month and year transitions. In this case, the calculation spans over a single month, from September to September. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic and managing different month lengths.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end transitions. For example, adding 7 days to September 8, 2021, should result in September 15, 2021.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year.

In this case, subtracting 10 days from January 2, 1958, will likely result in a date in December 1957. Understanding how to handle these transitions is crucial for accurately calculating the date 10 days prior to the anniversary date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day decrements and transitions between months and years.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should handle decrementing the day value and adjusting the month and year as needed.\n\n3. **Handling Month Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when subtracting days. If the day reaches the first day of the month, the month should decrement, and the day should be set to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Include rules to manage transitions between years when subtracting days. If the month is January and the day is 1, the year should decrement, and the month should be set to December.\n\n5. **Recursive Approach:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that subtracts one day at a time until the desired number of days (10 days in this case) has been subtracted. This recursive approach will handle the decrementing of days while managing month and year transitions.\n\n6. **Prolog Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the input date and the number of days to subtract. This will ensure that the date calculation is accurate and handles all necessary transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date 10 days prior to January 2, 1958, considering month-end transitions and potential year changes.\n\nBy following this plan, a Prolog program can be developed to accurately determine the date that was 10 days ago from a given anniversary date, considering all necessary date transitions and adjustments. This will provide a robust solution for date calculations in various scenarios.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from March 31, 2008, which would result in March 21, 2008, represented as 03/21/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. In this case, we need to handle the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. The key is to correctly decrement the day while considering month-end transitions. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting 10 days from March 31, 2008, should result in March 21, 2008.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

The last day of the first quarter of 2008 would be March 31, 2008. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to increment the date to April 1, 2008. This can be represented as 04/01/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the date by one day, considering the transition from March to April. The key is to handle the month-end transition correctly and ensure that the day is incremented appropriately. In this case, since March has 31 days, the next day after March 31 is April 1. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation and handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the date by one day.

Given that the first day of 2019 was a Tuesday, the first Monday of the year would be January 7, 2019. To find the date one month prior to this, we need to consider the month transition and handle the different number of days in each month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to account for the specific day of the week (Monday) and the starting day of the year (Tuesday).
