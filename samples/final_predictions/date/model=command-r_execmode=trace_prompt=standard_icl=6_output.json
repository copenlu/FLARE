                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that a week ago it was September 1, 2021. If it was September 1, 2021, a week ago, then today is September 8, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

Given that today is March 12, 2002, the date 24 hours later would be March 13, 2002. This can be represented as 03/13/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day. This involves understanding the month-day boundaries and handling the transition from one day to the next. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 12, then the next date should be March 13, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 31, the next date should be April 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., March 12 to March 13), month-end transitions (e.g., March 31 to April 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. From this information, we can deduce that today is May 1, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date. Since December 31 is the last day of the year, subtracting seven days means we need to go back into the previous month, December, and find the date that corresponds to seven days before December 31.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting days. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering the transition between months. For example, if `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to the US Thanksgiving in 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001. Therefore, one month before this date would be October 22, 2001, which can be represented as 10/22/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one month prior to a given date. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating dates based on the US Thanksgiving holiday and then performing a simple month subtraction, taking care to adjust the year if necessary (e.g., if the month is January). In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November. Use date manipulation functions to find the first day of November of the given year, then calculate the first Thursday, and finally add three weeks to get the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day (e.g., moving from March 31 to February), adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Thanksgiving and the month subtraction. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in matching the correct rules based on the input year and handling exceptions like leap years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months or calculating dates.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years to ensure the Thanksgiving date is calculated correctly and the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including end-of-year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before Thanksgiving for any given year, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively."

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to determine the date 10 days prior to yesterday's date, which was April 30, 2021. To find this date, we need to subtract 10 days from April 30, considering the month and day transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a certain number of days from a given date and handling the resulting date transitions, including those across month boundaries. We need to define rules that manage these transitions and recursively apply them to reach the desired date. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and search capabilities to facilitate this process.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling easy manipulation and transitions.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write rules to subtract a single day from a given date, accounting for month transitions when the day reaches the end of a month. For example, subtracting a day from April 30 should result in April 29.\n\n3. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction repeatedly, allowing us to subtract any desired number of days. This rule should handle the transitions between days and months.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to manage transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For instance, subtracting days from January 1 should decrement the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to accurately handle February's days during leap years.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Recursion:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities and recursion to find and apply the correct rules for date transitions. The recursive approach will enable us to subtract any number of days.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various situations, including transitions between months and years, and verify the results against expected dates.\n   - Test the program for dates like April 30 (as in the example), February 28, and December 31 to ensure it handles different months and years correctly.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog code will be able to determine the date 10 days ago from the provided starting date, accounting for all necessary transitions and special cases.",

This calculation will require us to traverse back through the calendar, adjusting the month and potentially the year as we go.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem necessitates understanding how to subtract a month from a given date and handling the subsequent adjustments to the day, month, and year. We need a systematic approach to determine the date a month ago, accounting for varying days in different months and potentially crossing over into the previous year. In SWI-Prolog, we can accomplish this by establishing rules for month subtraction and managing the associated transitions.\n\n**Plan for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize the `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure to represent dates, enabling straightforward arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction:**\n   - Construct a rule that subtracts one month from a given date. This rule should consider cases where the month being subtracted from is January, requiring a decrement of the year as well.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment:**\n   - Craft a rule to manage the day component when subtracting a month. If the target month has fewer days than the starting month, the day should be adjusted accordingly (e.g., to the last day of that month).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which will influence the number of days in February and require special handling during month subtractions spanning February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Employ Prolog's recursive capabilities to devise a rule that calculates the date one month prior using the aforementioned month subtraction rule. Prolog's search mechanisms will assist in determining the appropriate transitions.\n\n6. **Handling Boundary Cases:**\n   - Write rules to manage boundary cases, such as transitioning from February 29 to January 31 during leap years and similar scenarios.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test scenarios encompassing a variety of situations, including normal month transitions, year transitions, and leap years, to ensure the logic's correctness.\n   - Verify the program's behavior when subtracting months from the first day of a month to the last and vice versa.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that invites users to input a date and receives the corresponding date from one month ago.\n\nBy adhering to this plan, the resulting SWI-Prolog program will adeptly compute the date that was one month ago from any provided date, accounting for intricate transitions between months and years, including the intricacies of leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to determine the date one week prior to April 30, 2021. This involves calculating seven days back from the given date. As April 30 falls near the end of the month, we need to traverse through the weeks of April to reach the desired date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires handling week-based calculations and understanding the boundaries of months. We need to subtract seven days while considering the ending of one month and the beginning of the next. In SWI-Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and recursive rules to achieve this calculation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use the `date` structure, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, enabling arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Week Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract seven days from a given date. This rule should account for the end of the month by resetting the day to the last day of the previous month if necessary.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle transitions between months and years when subtracting the week. If the date falls in January, decrement the year and set the month to December.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion to repeatedly subtract one day at a time until reaching seven days prior.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to ensure accurate handling of February's days during leap years.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search capabilities and backtracking to apply the correct rules and navigate through different date transitions.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various situations, including transitions across months and years, and verify the accuracy of the week subtraction.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to develop a Prolog program that calculates the date one week prior to the given April 30, 2021, accounting for monthly and yearly transitions and leveraging Prolog's strengths in recursive and search-based logic.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that the deadline is two days away, which means it falls on June 1, 2021. To find the date of tomorrow, we need to add one day to the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple addition of one day to the current date. However, we must ensure that our solution handles cases where the current date is near the end of the month or year. We need a flexible approach that can handle such transitions seamlessly. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules for day addition and handling boundaries between months and years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling easy manipulation.\n\n2. **Normal Day Addition:**\n   - Write a rule to add one day to the given date. This rule should increment the day component (`DD`) by 1 while keeping the month and year intact.\n\n3. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the day component reaches its monthly maximum (e.g., May 31). When this occurs, the month should be incremented, and the day should reset to the first of the following month.\n   - Additionally, handle the year boundary when December 31 is reached.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to ensure that February is treated correctly during leap years (29 days) and non-leap years (28 days).\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's recursive capabilities to construct a rule that adds one day to the current date, considering the boundaries mentioned above.\n   - Employ Prolog's search features to match the appropriate rules and navigate through the date transitions.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test scenarios that cover normal day additions, month transitions, and year transitions to ensure the correctness of the program.\n   - Verify that the program handles both leap years and common years appropriately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in creating a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date for tomorrow, accounting for various transitions and special cases. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in handling complex and boundary cases through recursive searches and rule applications.",

We need to calculate the date seven days prior to the current date, which falls within the same month and year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward decrement of the current date by seven days. Since we are already two days before June 1, the week before today would land within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the decrement remains within the boundaries of the month, which means subtracting seven days from, say, May 29 would result in May 22.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for decrements in days within the same month and year.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by a specified number of days, handling the transition to the previous week within the same month. For example, two days before June 1 is May 30, and seven days prior would be May 23, 2021.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not required for this specific scenario, implement rules to handle transitions to the previous month and year when subtracting days. This would involve decrementing the month and potentially the year if the date goes back far enough.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly when subtracting days, even though it is not relevant for this case.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Number Specification:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that allows for the specification of the number of days to subtract. This rule should repeatedly decrement the date by one day until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct decrement rules based on the initial date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting days within the same month, transitioning to the previous month, and handling leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week ago from the current date, accounting for potential transitions across days and months but not years in this case.

The current date being discussed is presumably the present date, which needs to be calculated first, and then we can add two days and 24 hours to it to find the required date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the present date, adding two days, and then further extending that date by 24 hours. We need to ensure that the transitions between days, and potentially months and years, are handled correctly. In Prolog, we can achieve this by using date manipulation functions and recursive rules.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Determine the Current Date:**\n   - Use Prolog's built-in functions or rules to determine the current date. This might involve fetching the day, month, and year components.\n\n2. **Add Two Days:**\n   - Write a rule to add two days to the current date. This should handle the transitions between days, months, and years if necessary.\n\n3. **Increment by 24 Hours:**\n   - Implement a rule to further increment the date by 24 hours. This rule should focus on the hour increment while considering day, month, and year transitions if the increment causes a boundary crossing.\n\n4. **Leap Year and Hour Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to handle February's hours correctly. Also, handle the transition from AM to PM and vice versa for the hour component when crossing 12:00.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to handle the sequential additions of two days and 24 hours. Ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the date and time transitions.\n\n6. **Display the Result:**\n   - After calculating the final date, develop a rule to format and display the result in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that first determines the current date and then accurately calculates the specified deadline two days hence, accounting for various date and time transitions.",

This includes checking if the resulting date is within the same month and adjusting the month and year if necessary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to handle February dates correctly during leap years when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Special Case for Starting Date:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the case where the starting date is already at or near the beginning of the month. For example, if the given date is November 2 or earlier, subtracting 10 days would result in October.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules for day transitions and handle the special case mentioned above.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover both normal day transitions within the same month and the special case where the starting date is close to the month's beginning.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date 10 days ago from a given date, accounting for various scenarios and special cases. This will involve recursive logic and careful consideration of date transitions.",

This involves calculating the date that was exactly one month ago from this specific starting point.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires subtracting one month from the given date. This operation involves understanding the number of days in each month and handling transitions between months and potentially years. We need a logic that adjusts the month and day components accordingly when moving backwards in time. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and use pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations to decrement months while adjusting the day and year.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one month from the given date. This rule should consider the number of days in each month and adjust the day and month accordingly. For example, if the input date is 08/03/1997, the month July has 31 days, so the resulting date should be 07/03/1997.\n\n3. **Handling Month Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the day of the month goes beyond the last day of the previous month. For instance, if the input date is 08/31/1997, the previous month would be August, and the last day would be 31, so the resulting date should be 07/31/1997.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from January to December when subtracting months. If the input month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a rule to check for leap years, which will affect the number of days in February during the month subtraction process.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to handle the dynamic application of the month subtraction rule until the desired number of months is subtracted. The search capabilities will help in selecting the correct rule based on the date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various month transitions, year transitions, and leap years to ensure the correctness of the calculated dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one month prior to a given date.

To find the date one year ago, we simply need to decrement the year by one while keeping the month and day unchanged. The resulting date is August 3, 1996.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a straightforward decrement of the year while maintaining the month and day values.

In Prolog, this can be achieved using a simple rule that manages year decrements.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, capturing the month, day, and year components.\n\n2. **Decrement Year Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that decrements the year (`YYYY`) by one while keeping the month (`MM`) and day (`DD`) unchanged. For example, if the input date is 08/03/1997, the output date should be 08/03/1996.\n\n3. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Although not applicable to this specific date, include general rules for handling transitions when the day or month is January or February and the year decrement causes a leap year adjustment.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although a simple decrement is sufficient for this problem, implement a recursive rule to handle more complex year subtractions in the future. This will allow for flexibility in handling larger time intervals.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's pattern matching can be used to apply the year decrement rule correctly based on the input date structure.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover the basic year decrement scenario, as well as cases that go into the previous year, different months, and leap years to ensure the robustness of the rule.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date one year prior to a given date, focusing on year transitions while keeping the month and day intact.",

In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation efficiently.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a suitable structure, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy day addition while handling month boundaries.\n\n2. **Day Addition Function:**\n   - Write a function, `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)`, which adds a specified number of days to a given date. The function should handle day overflows into the next month or year.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions to the next month or year when adding days. For instance, if August 31 is encountered, the month should increment to September and the day should reset to 1.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to ensure that February is correctly handled when adding days. Leap years have 29 days in February, which needs to be considered when transitioning into March.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `add_days` function to add days iteratively. The function should continue adding days until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search:**\n   - Prolog's search capabilities will help identify the correct transition rules based on the initial date and the number of days to add.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the correctness of the `add_days` function, especially at month and year boundaries, including leap years. Test adding seven days to August 3, 1997, to confirm the expected outcome.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Develop a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the predicted date after the specified number of days.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one week from today, accounting for any necessary month or year transitions. This demonstrates the practical application of SWI-Prolog for date manipulation tasks.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly 24 hours after today, which is currently 08/03/1997. Adding 24 hours does not cross any month or year boundaries, so the date will remain the same in terms of month and year. The only change will be in the day component, which will increment by one.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of 24 hours, which equates to one day. We need to ensure that the date remains accurate, especially when crossing month and year boundaries, which are not a concern in this case. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining a simple rule for incrementing the day while keeping the month and year unchanged.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure is flexible enough to handle day increments without altering the month and year.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function or rule named `increment_day` that adds one day to the input date. This function should increment the `DD` component by 1 while keeping the `MM` and `YYYY` components unchanged.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Include logic to handle cases where the day reaches the end of the month (e.g., going from the 31st to the 1st of the following month). In this specific case, the month and year will remain the same.\n\n4. **Simple Addition:**\n   - Use a straightforward recursive function to add 24 hours (1 day) to the current date, calling the `increment_day` function four times.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific date, include a general check for leap years to handle February dates in other scenarios.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that verify the functionality of the `increment_day` function and the addition of multiple days.

To find this date, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date, considering potential transitions between months and years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a known number of days (10) from the given date. We should consider the possibility of transitioning into the previous month or year when performing this subtraction.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to find the date one week from today, given that today is September 9, 1909. To determine the date one week ahead, we need to add seven days to the current date. This involves understanding the number of days in each month and correctly adjusting the month and year if necessary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires basic date arithmetic, including the ability to add days and handle month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules for date manipulation and leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules correctly based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling operations like day addition.\n\n2. **Day Addition Function:**\n   - Create a function, `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)`, which adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle day overflows into the next month or year.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. For instance, if September 30 is encountered, the month should be updated to October, and the day should reset to 1. Similarly, crossing over December 31 should increment the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial for accurate date calculations spanning February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `add_days` function to add days iteratively. The function should continue adding days until the specified number of days is reached, updating the date accordingly.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search capabilities to apply the appropriate rules for month and year transitions based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, crossing into the next month, and handling leap years. For instance, validate that adding 7 days to September 9, 1909, results in September 16, 1909.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and query for the date after a specified number of days. Ensure the program provides clear instructions and handles various input scenarios.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate dates accurately, taking into account different months, year transitions, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to find the date 24 hours after the current date, which is September 9, 1909. Adding 24 hours does not cross any month or year boundaries, so the date will remain in September 1909.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the current date. There are no complex transitions across months or years to consider. We simply need to increment the hours and then adjust the day accordingly. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and arithmetic operations to handle this scenario.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY, Hour)` to represent the date with hours.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for arithmetic operations to add hours seamlessly.\n\n2. **Add Hours Function:**\n   - Write a function that adds a specified number of hours to a given date. This function should consider the day-to-day transition when the hours exceed 24 hours.\n\n3. **Adjust Day and Hour:**\n   - When adding hours, ensure that the day is adjusted appropriately if the hours cause the day to change. For example, if the date is September 9, 1909, and 24 hours are added, the day should become September 10.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not required for this specific scenario, implement rules to handle transitions across months and years when adding hours. This would involve incrementing the month or year when the days exceed the maximum for the current month or year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not necessary for this case, include a rule to check for leap years, which would affect the number of days in February.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive functions and Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct date after adding 24 hours. The search functionality will help in applying the correct rules based on the resulting date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as adding hours that span across midnight, and verify that the code produces the correct results.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that adds a specified number of hours to a given date, handling basic day transitions and potential month and year transitions if desired.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to determine the date that was 10 days prior to today, given that today is April 19, 1969. To find this date, we need to subtract 10 days from April 19, 1969, which will involve a transition to the previous month. The desired format for the answer is MM/DD/YYYY.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a historical date by subtracting a certain number of days from the current date. We need to handle transitions across different months and ensure the correct representation of the date in the specified format. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by establishing rules for decrementing days and managing month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in a logical manner.\n   - This structure should allow for flexible date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Decrement Days Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. The rule should account for the first day of the month by identifying the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from April 1, 1969, should result in March 31, 1969.\n\n3. **Month Transition Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to manage transitions to the previous month when decrementing days. This involves understanding the number of days in each month and making the necessary adjustments to the month and day values.\n\n4. **Leap Year Awareness:**\n   - Integrate a function to determine whether a given year is a leap year. This is vital for accurately handling February, which has 29 days in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that iteratively applies the single-day decrement rule. This rule should continue decrementing the date until the desired number of days is reached (10 days in this case).\n   - The recursion should handle the transition from one day to another, adjusting the date accordingly.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Matching:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to ensure that the correct rules are applied for different date transitions.\n   - Enable the program to determine when to decrement the day, month, or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, including situations where the subtraction crosses month boundaries, leap years, and non-leap years.\n   - Verify the program's accuracy in handling different numbers of subtracted days, such as 5 days or 10 days.\n\n8. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Design a user-friendly mechanism for users to input a starting date and receive the desired output in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to compute dates that were a certain number of days in the past, accounting for month transitions and leap years.

This requires handling transitions across different months and years. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, including decrementing years, and handling month and day boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for date calculations.\n\n2. **Decrement Year Function:**\n   - Implement a function to subtract one year from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe current date is April 19, 1969, and the task is to determine the date exactly 24 hours later. This involves a simple increment of time without crossing any month or year boundaries. The focus is on adding 24 hours to the current time, which will likely fall within the same day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a straightforward addition of time, keeping in mind that days have varying lengths. The main consideration is ensuring that the 24-hour increment does not exceed the end of the current day. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining a simple rule for incrementing time within the same day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `time(HH, MM, SS)` to represent time in hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n2. **Increment Time Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the hours (`HH`) by 24, maintaining the rest of the time fields within the same day.\n   - Handle the scenario where the incremented hours exceed 24 hours, ensuring that the time wraps around to the correct hour for the following day.\n\n3. **Combine Time and Date:**\n   - Combine the time structure with the date structure (`date(MM, DD, YYYY)`) to create a complete datetime representation.\n\n4. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Create a user-friendly predicate that takes the current date and time as input and returns the datetime 24 hours later.\n   - Ensure the output is in a human-readable format, such as MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the time increment rule, such as incrementing times within the same day and handling cases where the incremented time goes over the day boundary.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate the datetime 24 hours later from a given input.

We need to calculate the present date based on this information.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining the current date by leveraging the knowledge of Jane's birth year and the passage of 16 years. The key is to handle the leap year scenario, as February has 28 days in a regular year and 29 days in a leap year. In Prolog, we can implement rules to account for these differences and calculate the current date accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n\n2. **Handle Leap Years:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a year is a leap year. This will be crucial in determining the number of days in February.\n\n3. **Increment Years:**\n   - Define a rule to increment the year by 16, considering the leap year scenario.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday indicates that she was born on February 29, 2000, since it is the only leap year with a 16-year cycle. Today, on her 16th birthday, the date is February 29, 2016. To find the date tomorrow, we need to determine the date after February 29, 2016.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves handling a specific date, February 29, which occurs only in leap years. The task is to calculate the date immediately after this special day. This requires understanding leap years and the transition from the end of February to the beginning of March. In Prolog, we can manage this by defining rules that identify leap years and handle the transition between these months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, allowing for easy arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Identify Leap Years:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a year is a leap year. This is crucial for identifying February 29 as a valid date.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule for the transition from February to March, which increments the month and resets the day to the first.\n   - Ensure this rule has a condition to handle February 28 or 29 based on the leap year check.\n\n4. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day by one, which is applicable for most days of the month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a recursive function that adds one day at a time to a given date until it reaches the target date.\n   - Use this function to find the date after February 29, by recursively adding days and applying the appropriate transition rules.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to find the correct path through the recursive date calculation, especially when handling the February-to-March transition.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the leap year identification rule to ensure it recognizes 2000 and 2016 as leap years.\n   - Verify the date transition from February 28 or 29 to March 1, both in a leap year and a non-leap year.\n\n8. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a birthdate (year, month, and day), and then calculate and display the date for tomorrow.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can handle special dates like February 29 and compute the date for tomorrow.

We need a solution that accounts for the varying lengths of months and the leap year status of the given year (2016). In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and rules to handle these complexities.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a suitable date representation, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to cover all necessary date calculations.\n\n2. **Leap Year Detection:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for determining the number of days in February of the given year.\n\n3. **Last Day of February:**\n   - Develop a rule to identify the last day of February for a given year. This rule should consider both regular and leap years, setting the day component to the appropriate last day (e.g., February 29 in a leap year).\n\n4. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one year from a given date.

Today, Jane is celebrating her special day, and the task is to determine the date one week ago from this special birthday. Since February has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year, we need to establish whether the current year is a leap year or not to find the correct date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the date seven days prior to the last day of February in the current year, which happens to be Jane's birthday. We need to determine if the current year is a leap year to accurately establish the number of days in February.

Ensure that this structure can handle different scenarios of February days based on leap years.\n\n2. **Leap Year Detection:**\n   - Write a rule to check if the current year (`YYYY`) is a leap year. This can be done by evaluating if the year is divisible by four and checking for any remaining conditions of a leap year.\n\n3. **Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a week (seven days) from today's date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Jane's 16th birthday, given that she was born on the last day of February in the year 2000. As today is her birthday, the date 24 hours from now would be the same day and month, but 24 hours later, in the year 2001.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple date calculation that adds 24 hours to the current date. Since Jane's birthday is on the last day of February, the year will change to 2001. The key is to recognize that a simple addition of hours does not affect the month or day, but it does affect the year. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions to handle this scenario.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for simple additions of time, in this case, 24 hours.\n\n2. **Add Time Function:**\n   - Implement a function that adds a specified number of hours to a given date. The function should increment the hours, taking into account the change in days due to the added hours and updating the date accordingly.\n\n3. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year because it affects the number of days in February. Luckily, both 2000 and 2001 are leap years, so this consideration is not needed for this specific date.\n\n4. **Time Addition for 24 Hours:**\n   - Apply the time addition function to add 24 hours to Jane's birthday, which falls on the last day of February in the year 2000.\n\n5. **Handling Year Transition:**\n   - Ensure that the code accounts for the year transition when the hours are added, changing the year from 2000 to 2001.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's built-in search capabilities will help find the correct date by applying the time addition function and pattern matching on the date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the functionality of the time addition function, especially around month and year boundaries. Test with different hours added and verify the correct behavior.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that adds a specified number of hours to a given date, handling year transitions when the date falls on the last day of a month.

In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and create rules to handle these complexities.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date representation like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to cover all necessary date ranges and calculations.\n\n2. **Leap Year Detection:**\n   - Write a rule to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for handling February's day count accurately.\n\n3. **Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. When subtracting from the last day of February, the day should wrap around to the last day of January, and the month should decrement.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle the transition from February to January when subtracting days. If the resulting date goes into the previous year, decrement the year as well.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule iteratively until the desired number of days (10 days in this case) is reached.\n\n6. **Special Case for February:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the variable length of February by checking if the year is a leap year. If it is, February will have 29 days; otherwise, it will have 28 days.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and recursion to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules for date transitions and leap year handling.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover both leap and non-leap years to ensure the correctness of the recursive subtraction and leap year consideration.\n   - Verify that the program can handle the transition from the last day of February to the last day of January when subtracting days.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date 10 days ago from Jane's 16th birthday, accounting for leap years and month transitions. This will involve a combination of date manipulation, recursive logic, and leap year detection.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their marriage 50 years ago on January 2, 1958, and today is their golden wedding anniversary. Since this special day marks exactly 50 years since their wedding, tomorrow will be January 3, 2008, as it is the day following this momentous anniversary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a historical event date and recognizing the current date as a special one\u2014the golden wedding anniversary. The task is to determine the date for the day after this significant anniversary. To solve this, we need to understand how to increment dates by a specific number of years and identify the current date accurately. In Prolog, this can be approached by defining rules for date arithmetic and handling special cases related to anniversaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for arithmetic operations to add years.\n\n2. **Date Arithmetic:**\n   - Implement a function to increment a date by a specified number of years. This function should handle the addition of years, months, and days accordingly.\n\n3. **Golden Anniversary Detection:**\n   - Write a rule to check if the current date is the golden wedding anniversary of a wedding that took place on January 2, 1958. This may involve checking if the year is 50 years later and the date is January 2.\n\n4. **Special Case Handling:**\n   - When the current date is detected as the golden anniversary, the code should prepare for the date arithmetic to add one more day.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to handle leap years to ensure accurate date calculations, especially around February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct date and apply the appropriate rules for date arithmetic.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the date arithmetic function with various inputs, including dates that cross month and year boundaries, and verify the correct output.\n   - Specifically, test the golden anniversary detection rule with the date January 2, 2008, to ensure the correct special case handling.\n\n8. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Apply the date arithmetic function to increment the golden anniversary date by one day, thus finding the date for tomorrow.\n\nThe code prompt will assist the user in crafting a Prolog program that celebrates Jane and John's golden anniversary and determines the date for tomorrow.

        "question": "Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. Today is their golden wedding anniversary. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their golden wedding anniversary today, which means they were married exactly 50 years ago. If today is their golden anniversary, then the date a month ago was January 2, 1958, represented as 01/02/1958 in MM/DD/YYYY format. This date marks the beginning of Jane and John's marriage.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining a date that is exactly one month prior to a known anniversary date. The key is to understand that the anniversary date itself is 50 years after the wedding date. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle date arithmetic, calculating dates that are a certain number of months or years in the past or future.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that this structure supports arithmetic operations for date calculations.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations:**\n   - Implement functions to perform basic arithmetic operations on dates, such as adding or subtracting years and months.\n   - These functions should handle transitions between months and years accurately.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Write rules to check if a year is a leap year, as this affects the number of days in February and thus the date calculations.\n\n4. **Special Case for January and February:**\n   - Handle the unique transition between January and February due to their different lengths. Subtracting one month from January should transition to the last day of the previous month, February.\n\n5. **Recursive Date Calculation:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that can calculate dates that are a certain number of months ago or in the future. This function should decrement the month count recursively while applying the appropriate date transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and backtracking capabilities to find the correct path through the recursive date calculations, ensuring that the correct date is determined.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correctness of the date calculations, especially around month and year transitions.\n   - Test the code with different anniversary dates spanning various months and years.\n\nThe code prompt will assist the user in crafting a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one month ago from a given anniversary date. This will involve implementing date arithmetic operations and handling the transitions between months and years, ensuring the integrity of the date calculations.",

The focus will be on implementing a clear and concise rule to add days to a given date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure is designed to handle day increments within a month.\n\n2. **Increment Days Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that adds a specified number of days to a given date. The rule should increment days, considering the number of days in the month and resetting to the first day of the next month if needed.\n\n3. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Although not required for this specific scenario, implement general rules to handle transitions across months and years when adding days.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates accurately, even though it is not relevant for this particular case.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Write recursive rules to handle adding multiple days, allowing for flexibility in the code to handle different scenarios.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s rule application and pattern matching to ensure the correct date transition is applied when adding days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various situations, such as adding days within the same month, transitioning between months, and transitioning between years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly adds seven days to January 2, 1958, resulting in January 9, 2008.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can compute a date one week from a given date, focusing on clear and concise rules for adding days while accounting for potential boundaries and transitions.",

We need to subtract three years from the current date while considering month and day boundaries. The challenge lies in handling the transition between the years correctly. In Prolog, we can utilize rules and recursion to manage these date arithmetic operations and handle inter-year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the current year is `YYYY`, then subtracting one year should result in `YYYY - 1`.\n\n3. **Recursive Year Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that subtracts years repeatedly. This rule should decrement the provided years count and apply the single-year subtraction rule until reaching zero.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Boundaries:**\n   - Write rules to handle the transitions between months and days when subtracting years.

She remembers her second day at work, which was December 2nd. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to calculate 3 years and 10 days back from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is both a fixed number of years and days in the past. The key considerations are handling the year transitions and then subtracting the required number of days. This might involve crossing boundaries between months and potentially handling leap years. In Prolog, we can approach this by defining rules for both year and day subtractions while accounting for these transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations to add and subtract years and days.\n\n2. **Subtract Three Years:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract three years from the current date. This will likely involve changing the `YYYY` component while keeping the `MM` and `DD` components intact.\n\n3. **Subtract Ten Days:**\n   - After subtracting the years, write a rule to subtract ten days, considering month boundaries and potential leap years.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. This may involve resetting the month or year when the number of days decreases to zero or goes negative.\n\n5. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if the year is a leap year, which will influence the number of days in February during the subtraction process.\n\n6. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that continues to subtract days until reaching zero. This rule should handle the transitions mentioned above.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and rule application to find and apply the correct rules for date transitions during both year and day subtractions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct calculation of dates for different starting points, including various months and years, and check the handling of leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that performs complex date calculations, accounting for year transitions and day subtractions, ultimately finding the date that was 10 days ago from a given starting date.",

The task is to determine the date of her two-year work anniversary, which would have been one year ago from today. Since Jane started working in 2016, and it's now her three-year anniversary, today's date must be in 2019. The date one year ago was in 2018.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date one year ago from today, which requires subtracting one year from the current date. While this seems straightforward, we must account for changes in the year and potentially the month when performing this subtraction. We need a systematic approach to handle these transitions in Prolog.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date representation like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to describe dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that this structure can handle arithmetic operations, such as subtracting years.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one year from a given date. This rule should decrement the `YYYY` component by 1 while keeping the `MM` and `DD` components unchanged, creating the same date one year ago.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the date one year ago would have been in the previous year.

We need an approach that can manage these temporal calculations accurately. In Prolog, we can utilize rules and arithmetic operations to handle such scenarios. The key is to ensure that the correct date is determined three years ago, and then a week is added to that date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure supports arithmetic operations for year subtractions and day additions.\n\n2. **Subtract Three Years:**\n   - Write a rule or function that subtracts three years from the current date. This should decrement the year by three while keeping the month and day intact.\n\n3. **Add One Week:**\n   - Implement a function or rule to add seven days to a given date. This function should increment the day by seven, considering month boundaries.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the code handles transitions between months and years when adding days. If the target date falls into the next month or year, the corresponding variables should be updated.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates accurately during leap years.\n\n6. **Sequential Application:**\n   - Use Prolog's control constructs or recursive logic to first subtract three years and then add one week to the resulting date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and arithmetic capabilities to perform the date calculations accurately. The search functionality will help find the correct intermediate and final dates.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correctness of the code when subtracting years and adding weeks, especially around month and year boundaries and during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can handle complex temporal calculations, such as determining a date three years and one week ago, while accounting for various calendar scenarios and leap years.",

The task is to determine the date one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date exactly one week after the current date, which is December 2, 2019. This simple calculation requires adding seven days to the current date while considering the year, month, and day components. The main consideration is ensuring that the correct date is determined without any errors in the week addition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, which allows for easy arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Addition of Days:**\n   - Write a rule that adds a specified number of days (in this case, 7 days) to a given date. The rule should increment the day accordingly and handle the transition to the next month or year if needed.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month or year when adding days. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, adding 7 days would lead to January 7 of the following year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February dates accurately during leap years.\n\n5. **Simple Test Cases:**\n   - Write simple test cases to verify the addition of days within the same month and across month boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a straightforward Prolog program that adds a specified number of days (one week) to a given date, handling common date transitions.

This likely involves crossing into new months and possibly a new year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires adding a certain number of days (176) to a known date and handling the resulting date calculation, including month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules for incrementing days, months, and years, and then applying these rules based on the initial date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for operations that add days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Increment Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition of days into months and roll over the days into the next month or year when necessary.\n\n3. **Month and Year Increment:**\n   - Implement rules to handle the increment of months and years when a large number of days is added.

In Prolog, we can accomplish this by implementing rules for date arithmetic, considering the number of days in each month and handling special cases like leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for operations that add and subtract days from a given date.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition of days into months and years. For example, adding 30 days to March 20, 2020, should result in May 1, 2020.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Develop a similar function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days. This will be used to find the date 10 days ago.\n\n4. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions to handle transitions to the next month when the days exceed the days in the current month. For instance, adding 31 days to April 10 should bring us to June 11.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's variable length during leap years. This will affect the number of days added or subtracted.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the date addition and subtraction functions to handle cases where multiple months or years are crossed.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules when adding or subtracting days.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the addition and subtraction functions with various scenarios, including transitions across months and years, and verify the correct output.\n   - Specifically, test the subtraction of 10 days from a date to ensure it returns the desired date 10 days ago.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can perform date calculations involving the addition and subtraction of multiple days, handling various calendar scenarios. This will involve implementing rules for date arithmetic, leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules correctly.",

In Prolog, this can be accomplished by implementing rules for date arithmetic, especially day subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that this structure supports arithmetic operations, especially day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a single day from a given date. For example, subtracting one day from September 11, 2020, should result in September 10, 2020.\n\n3. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a recursive function that subtracts multiple days. This function should repeatedly subtract one day until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n4. **Handling Months and Years:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For instance, if the current date is September 1, then subtracting days should go back to August.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly needed for this specific date calculation, include a rule to check for leap years to handle February's day count during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the recursive day subtraction function with various starting dates and numbers of days to subtract, including cases that cross month boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a past date based on the given number of days, accounting for regular day transitions and month boundaries. This will be a useful tool for performing date calculations within a specific time range.",

We need to handle the transitions between years and potentially between months when performing this calculation. In Prolog, we can leverage date manipulation functions and recursive rules to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations to facilitate date calculations.\n\n2. **Current Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the current date based on the information that 36 hours from now, it will be 2015. Consider the time zones and hour adjustments required to pinpoint the exact current date and time.\n\n3. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Implement a function that subtracts one year from a given date. This function should handle the transition between years and adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n4. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - When subtracting a year, ensure that the day and month remain within the boundaries of the previous year.

Employ Prolog's search and pattern matching to apply the correct rules and transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years, both common years and leap years, to verify that the code correctly handles date transitions and adjustments.\n   - Test the code for dates close to year-end transitions to ensure accurate handling of December dates.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a prompt that allows users to input the number of hours until a future year begins.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, taking into account that in 36 hours, it will be 2015. This means that today is December 30, 2014, and we need to calculate the date seven days prior.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining the date one week ago from the current date, which requires subtracting seven days from today's date. We need to handle the transition between days, potentially across month boundaries. In addition, we must consider the current date and time to be within 36 hours of the start of 2015. In Prolog, we can manage this by defining rules for date arithmetic and leveraging Prolog's temporal reasoning capabilities.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Representing Dates:**\n   - Use a date representation like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to describe dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure this representation allows for date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Handling Time and Date:**\n   - Create a rule that checks the current time, ensuring it falls within 36 hours before the start of 2015. This rule will validate the given condition.\n\n3. **Subtracting Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days (seven days in this case) from a given date. This rule should handle day transitions across months and years.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For instance, if the date is January 1, then subtract one day from the year and set the month to December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to accurately handle February when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Recursive Date Subtraction:**\n   - Use recursion to subtract multiple days iteratively. This approach will handle the one-week time frame accurately.\n\n7. **Prolog's Search and Inference:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search and inference engine to apply the correct rules based on the current date and time.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including transitions across months and years, and around leap days.\n   - Ensure tests include dates within the 36-hour window leading up to 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the accurate date one week ago from today, accounting for temporal constraints and date transitions.

Today's date is given as 02/01/1987, which indicates that it is January 2, 1987 in the UK. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date based on a given date, but with a unique twist of considering the UK date format where the day precedes the month. The main challenge lies in correctly interpreting the date format and then performing the necessary arithmetic to subtract one year. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules that handle date manipulation and format conversion between different date representations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representations:**\n   - Use two different date representations: `uk_date(DD, MM, YYYY)` for the UK format and `standard_date(MM, DD, YYYY)` for the traditional format.\n   - Ensure these structures can handle date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Convert Date Formats:**\n   - Write rules to convert between the UK date format and the standard format. For example, converting 02/01/1987 to `standard_date(MM, DD, YYYY)` format should yield `standard_date(01, 02, 1987)`.\n\n3. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one year from a given date in the standard format. This will likely involve changing the year by -1 and handling any resulting date adjustments due to the year change.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the month and day values remain within their respective ranges. For example, February should go back to February and not January, even when subtracting one year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to handle any adjustments needed in the year subtraction, especially for February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive function to apply the year subtraction rule repeatedly until reaching the desired date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine when to apply the year subtraction rule and manage the recursive calls.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the conversion between UK and standard date formats for various dates.\n   - Verify that the year subtraction works correctly, including cases where the date wraps around from December to January.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one year ago from a given UK date format, requiring date format conversions and arithmetic. The program should handle various scenarios, including leap years and month boundaries, to provide the correct result in the UK date format.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's flight is booked for July 29, 2002, which means she made the booking for a date in the future. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to calculate 10 days prior to the booked date, which would be July 19, 2002.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a historical date based on a future date and a specified interval (10 days). This requires us to perform date arithmetic, subtracting a certain number of days from a given future date. The challenge lies in handling transitions between months and potentially years during this subtraction. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle these transitions and subtract the required number of days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write rules to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. The rules should account for different month lengths and handle the transition to the previous month accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting 10 days from July 29, 2002, should result in July 19, 2002.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. This may involve checking if the resulting day is prior to the start of the current month.\n   - Special care should be taken for February in leap years to ensure the correct number of days is subtracted.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to determine if a given year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that accepts a starting date and the number of days to subtract.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's flight is booked for July 29, 2002, which means she made the booking a day earlier, on July 28, 2002. To find the date a month ago, we need to calculate the date that was one month prior to July 28, 2002.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date that is a specific number of days (exactly one month) before a given date. This involves understanding date arithmetic, including handling transitions between months and potentially years. In this case, subtracting one month from July 28, 2002, would result in June 28, 2002. We need a Prolog code that can handle such calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a clear and structured representation for dates, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to facilitate calculations.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. This rule should account for different month lengths and adjust the day accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from July 28, 2002, should yield June 28, 2002.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - When subtracting a month, the day might exceed the number of days in the new month. Account for this by resetting the day to the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - If the month subtraction leads to a new year, the year should be decremented accordingly. Create a rule to manage this transition.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, as this affects the number of days in February and thus may impact the calculation.\n\n6. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that can subtract a variable number of days from a given date. This function should decrement the provided number of days and apply the month subtraction rule repeatedly until reaching zero days.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct path through the recursive subtraction, ensuring the appropriate month and year transitions are made.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the month subtraction function for various scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and verify the correctness of the calculations.\n   - Ensure that the code handles leap years correctly by testing with dates spanning February of leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one month prior to a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane has booked a flight for tomorrow, which is July 29, 2002. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate the date seven days after July 29, 2002. This calculation involves understanding the number of days in each month and handling the transition between months and years if necessary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem requires us to add seven days to the given date, potentially spanning across multiple months or even years. We need a systematic approach to handle these transitions and ensure the correct date is calculated. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and recursive rules to manage these scenarios effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a suitable structure, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for operations like adding days to a date.\n\n2. **Day Addition Function:**\n   - Write a rule to add a single day to a given date. If the resulting day is greater than the last day of the month, increment the month accordingly and reset the day to the first day of the next month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions across months and years when adding days. For instance, if the date is December 31 and we add more days to it, the year should be incremented.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly applies the single-day addition rule until the desired number of days (seven days) is reached.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial when adding days across February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive rules to automatically manage the date transitions and find the correct result.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days across month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane has booked a flight for tomorrow, which is currently scheduled for July 29, 2002. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 24 hours to the timing of the flight departure. Since this addition will not cross any day boundaries, it simply involves a time addition.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a time addition to the existing date and does not cross any day, month, or year boundaries. The focus is solely on adding hours to the current date. In Prolog, we can achieve this by using date and time manipulation functions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Representing Time:**\n   - Represent time as a structure like `time(Hour, Minute, Second)`.\n   - Ensure this structure allows basic arithmetic operations to add hours.\n\n2. **Converting to Time Structure:**\n   - Write a rule to convert the current date, given in MM/DD/YYYY format, into a time structure. This rule should extract the hour, minute, and second components, considering time zones and any necessary adjustments.\n\n3. **Adding Hours:**\n   - Develop a rule to add a specified number of hours (in this case, 24 hours) to the time structure. This should increment the hour component by 24 while handling any overflow into the next day.\n\n4. **Converting Back to Date Structure:**\n   - Create a rule to convert the time structure back into a date format. This will require adjusting the day, month, and year based on the updated time.\n\n5. **Leap Year and Time Zone Considerations:**\n   - Include checks for leap years to handle any discrepancies in the number of days in February.\n   - Address time zone differences, ensuring the time addition is relative to the provided date's time zone.\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design the code to interactively take the current date (MM/DD/YYYY) as input from the user and provide the resulting date after the addition as output.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that performs time addition to a given date, ensuring the logic handles time zones and leap years appropriately.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's habit of visiting the bookstore on the 16th of every month, coupled with her fifth visit today, provides a unique situation. We need to determine the date today, taking into account the recurring bookstore visits and the passage of time since Jane's first visit in October 2009.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we must understand the monthly visits and calculate the current date based on the recurring pattern. This involves knowing the number of days in each month and accounting for potential differences in the number of days between months. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and recursive rules to handle the recurring visits and determine the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy manipulation of months and days.\n\n2. **Initialize the First Visit:**\n   - Define the initial date as `date(10, 16, 2009)` to represent Jane's first bookstore visit.\n\n3. **Recursive Rule for Bookstore Visits:**\n   - Write a recursive rule that adds one month to the previous bookstore visit. This rule should handle the varying days in different months and update the day accordingly if the month changes.\n   - For example, after the fourth visit, the date would be calculated as `date(02, 16, 2010)`.\n\n4. **Handling the Fifth Visit:**\n   - Implement a condition in the recursive rule to identify when the fifth visit occurs.

        "question": "Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from the October of 2009. It is her 5th visit to the bookstore today. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's bookstore visits are meticulously timed for the 16th of every month. Her fifth visit today implies that she has been to the bookstore four times before this month. As such, we can deduce that today is the fourth occurrence of the 16th day since October 2009. Therefore, tomorrow will be the fifth instance of the 17th day of the month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding recurring events that happen on specific days of each month. We need to determine the date based on the recurring pattern and the number of times Jane has already visited the bookstore. This requires calculating the current month and day, and then adding one day to obtain the next occurrence. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and recursive rules to handle this recurring pattern.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy manipulation of months and days.\n\n2. **Recurring_visit(Count, MM, DD, YYYY):**\n   - Write a rule that calculates the current date based on Jane's recurring visits. The `Count` represents the number of previous visits (starting from the first visit).\n   - Use date arithmetic operations to increment the month and day accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling the Fifth Visit:**\n   - In the current scenario, we need to find the date for the fifth visit. The rule should adjust the day to 17 for the fifth occurrence.\n\n4. **Leap Year and Month Lengths:**\n   - Implement logic to handle leap years and different month lengths. This is crucial when calculating the fifth occurrence, as months have varying day counts.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion to find the next occurrence of the bookstore visit pattern. Start from the initial visit and increment the count until it matches the desired visit number (fifth visit).\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Arithmetic Functions:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and built-in arithmetic functions to compute the correct date based on the recurring pattern.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different starting months and years to ensure the code can handle various scenarios, such as starting in a leap year or non-standard months like February.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of Jane's fifth bookstore visit based on her recurring pattern, demonstrating the program's ability to understand and manipulate dates according to specified rules.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's bookstore visits are meticulously timed for the 16th of every month. Today marks her 5th visit, which means we need to calculate the date 10 days ago from the current month's 16th day. This involves determining the previous month's 16th day and then subtracting an additional 10 days.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we require a combination of understanding Jane's visit pattern and performing date calculations.

This helps establish the starting point for our calculations.\n\n3. **Calculate the 16th Day of the Previous Month:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the 16th day of the previous month. For example, if today is November 16, the previous month's 16th day would be October 16.\n\n4. **Subtract Ten Days:**\n   - Use a recursive rule to subtract ten days from the identified 16th day of the previous month. This involves repeatedly subtracting one day at a time until reaching the target date.\n\n5. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions across months and years when subtracting days. This includes adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing boundaries.\n\n6. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to ensure accurate date calculations, especially when dealing with February's days.\n\n7. **Prolog's Search and Recursion:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to find the appropriate rules for Jane's visit pattern and date calculations.\n   - Employ recursion for the ten-day subtraction, applying the day subtraction rule repeatedly.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the code with different visit numbers and months to ensure it calculates the correct dates, handling both normal and edge cases.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that simulates Jane's bookstore visits and accurately computes the date ten days ago from the current month's 16th day.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's bookstore visits are meticulously timed to the 16th of every month. Today marks her 5th visit, which means it's the month following her 4th visit. We need to determine the date of the 4th visit to calculate the date of the previous (5th) visit.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nSolving this problem involves understanding Jane's regular monthly visits and calculating the date of the fourth visit based on the information given. We need to handle the transition between months and years to find the correct previous date. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and recursive rules to determine the desired date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, ensuring it suits operations like month addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Initial Date Calculation:**\n   - Start by calculating the date of Jane's first visit, which is October 16, 2009. This can be represented as `date(10, 16, 2009)`.\n\n3. **Fourth Visit Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the fourth visit based on the first visit. This involves adding three months to the initial date, taking into account the potential year transition when crossing December.\n\n4. **Previous Visit Calculation:**\n   - To find the date of the fifth visit, or the previous visit, subtract one month from the date of the fourth visit. Handle the day component, ensuring it remains within the month's range.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to accurately handle February when adding or subtracting months. This is crucial to ensure the correct date is calculated across different years.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog's recursive capabilities to iteratively apply the rules for the first, fourth, and previous visits. The search capabilities will help find the appropriate transitions and dates based on the given information.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the logic, including scenarios that cross year boundaries and leap years, ensuring the results match the expected dates.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to develop a Prolog program that simulates Jane's bookstore visits and accurately determines the date of her previous visit.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's visits to the bookstore occur on the 16th of every month. If today is her fifth visit, then she has been coming to the bookstore for four months, starting from October 2009. Therefore, one year ago from today would have been her first visit to the bookstore, which was on October 16, 2009.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining a specific recurring event's occurrence in the past, which is Jane's visit to the bookstore on the 16th of each month. We need to calculate the date that corresponds to the first visit one year ago. This requires understanding the monthly recurrence and adjusting for the year change. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage the recurring event and handle the date arithmetic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Recurring Event Representation:**\n   - Create a structure like `event(MM, DD)` to represent the recurring event, which occurs on the DDth day of each MM.\n\n3. **Initial Event Date:**\n   - For the initial prompt, assume the first visit started on October 16, 2009, as per the explanation, and represent it as `event(10, 16)`.\n\n4. **Calculate Previous Occurrences:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the previous occurrence of the event. This rule should decrement the month and keep the day unchanged if the current month is earlier than the event month. If the month is the same, the year should be decremented.\n\n5. **Handle Year Change:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the year change when going back more than 12 months. This will require adjusting the month and year accordingly.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to keep calculating previous occurrences of the event, adjusting the date until the desired occurrence one year ago is found.\n\n7. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to ensure that the day of the month is handled correctly, especially when crossing into February.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive rules to find the correct previous occurrence of the event, handling the transitions between months and years.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different starting months and years to ensure the code correctly calculates the dates of previous occurrences.\n   - Verify that the program handles different recurring events and edge cases, such as different day values and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of Jane's first bookstore visit one year ago, considering monthly recurrences and year transitions.

        "question": "Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from the October of 2009. It is her 5th visit to the bookstore today. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's bookstore visits follow a regular pattern, with visits occurring on the 16th of every month. If today is her fifth visit, then we can deduce that it is currently the month of February 2010, five months after her first visit in October 2009. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate the 23rd of February 2010.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding Jane's regular bookstore visits and determining the current month and year based on her visit count. We also need to calculate the date one week ahead, which requires handling day and potentially month transitions. This can be achieved by implementing rules for incrementing days and months in Prolog.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, where MM represents the month, DD represents the day, and YYYY represents the four-digit year.\n\n2. **Determine the Current Date:**\n   - Write a rule to determine the current date based on Jane's visit count. If Jane's first visit was in October 2009, her fifth visit would be in February 2010.\n\n3. **Increment Days and Weeks:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment days and another rule to increment weeks, handling transitions between days and months. For example, incrementing 7 days from February 16, 2010, should result in February 23, 2010.\n\n4. **Month Transitions:**\n   - Handle transitions between months when incrementing weeks. If the target date falls into the next month, the month should be incremented accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which will affect the number of days in February. This is crucial for accurately calculating dates in the context of Jane's visits.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct path when incrementing weeks, considering month transitions and leap years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different visit counts to verify that the correct dates are calculated, such as Jane's third visit (December 2009) and fourth visit (January 2010).\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that infers the current date based on Jane's visit pattern and then calculates the date one week ahead, accounting for various date transitions.

The goal is to find the date one week from this corrected date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo find the date one week from today, we need to calculate the date seven days ahead of March 12, 2002.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days prior to today, given that today is the first day of 2007. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date. This involves understanding how dates are structured and adjusting the day count appropriately when crossing month boundaries.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires performing date arithmetic, specifically subtracting a certain number of days from a given date. We need to handle transitions between different days and months, ensuring that the correct date is determined even when crossing into the previous month or year. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and leverage the program's search capabilities to apply the correct rules accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling easy manipulation and arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between months and years when the required subtraction extends beyond the current month or year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement specific rules to handle day subtraction that crosses month boundaries. For instance, if the current date is `date(1, 1, 2007)` and we subtract 10 days, it should result in `date(12, 22, 2006)`.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial for accurate date calculations involving that month.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction and Search:**\n   - Utilize recursion within the `subtract_days` function to subtract one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to match the appropriate rules based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create comprehensive test cases that cover various scenarios, including transitions between months and years, as well as leap years. For example, testing the function with the date 01/01/2007 and subtracting 10 days should return 12/22/2006.\n\n7. **User Input and Interaction:**\n   - Develop a user-friendly mechanism for users to input a date and prompt the program to calculate the date from a specified number of days ago.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to perform date arithmetic, finding the correct date that was 10 days prior to any given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one year prior to today, assuming today is the first day of 2007. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from today's date. This operation involves a straightforward decrement of the year component while keeping the month and day unchanged, as they do not vary significantly within the same year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a simple date arithmetic operation that subtracts one year. However, we must ensure that the month and day remain consistent, especially when crossing over from December to January. In Prolog, this can be achieved using rules that handle year transitions while maintaining the integrity of the month and day values.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. This structure should be able to handle year subtraction while preserving the month and day.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one year from a given date. When subtracting a year, the month and day should remain the same, and only the year component should decrement.\n\n3. **Special Handling for January:**\n   - Implement a condition in the rule to check if the month is January. In this case, increment the month by 11, keeping the year one less. This accounts for the transition from December to January.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Leap years need to be considered, as they have 366 days. Include a condition to handle this, ensuring the correct date is calculated across different years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Although a straightforward calculation, use Prolog's recursive capabilities and search functions to apply the year subtraction rule and find the correct previous year date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the functionality of the year subtraction, such as subtracting one year from various dates across different months and years, including leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a simple yet effective Prolog program that subtracts one year from a given date, considering the special case of the January transition and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week prior to today, assuming today is the first day of 2007. We need to calculate the date seven days before January 1, 2007. This involves understanding the previous month's last day and adjusting the month and year accordingly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we will subtract seven days from the current date, which happens to be the first day of the year. This requires a careful consideration of the dates and months that precede January 1. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle this date arithmetic, including month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. This structure should support operations like day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a single day from a given date. If the day to be subtracted is the first day of the month, the month should remain the same, and the day should be set to the last day of that month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1. When subtracting days from January 1, the year should decrement by 1, and the month should change to December.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that subtracts multiple days. This function should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days is subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, as this affects the number of days in February. Ensure that the correct number of days is subtracted when dealing with February in leap years.\n\n6. **Pattern Matching and Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and search capabilities to determine the appropriate rules for transitions and apply them accordingly during the recursive day subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including transitions across December 31 to January 1 and February in leap and non-leap years. For example, subtracting 7 days from January 1, 2007, should result in December 25, 2006.\n\n8. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Design a user-friendly interface where users can input a date and receive the result for the date one week ago. Provide informative feedback for valid and invalid inputs.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to accurately calculate the date one week prior to any given date, accounting for various date and month transitions, and it will be interactive enough to engage users.",

If the year is already the latest (e.g., 9999), it should remain the same when adding days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's date range appropriately. In a leap year, February should have 29 days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to add days iteratively until the total number of days reaches the desired value (seven days).\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the appropriate transition rules based on the current date and the days to be added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `add_days` function across different scenarios: adding days within the same month, crossing into the next month, and handling leap years.\n\n9. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Develop a user-friendly predicate that takes today's date as input and provides the date one week from today as output.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date accurately, considering various date transitions and special cases.

This function should handle the transition from January 1 to January 2 by incrementing the year when the day reaches 2.\n\n3. **Handling Normal Days:**\n   - Implement a rule for normal day increments where the day is not January 1. This rule simply increments the day by one, considering the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will affect the number of days in February.

        "question": "Today is Apr 10, 1985. Jane's appointment will be 3 days later. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date today, given that Jane's appointment is scheduled three days later than the current date. We know that today is not the appointment day, and the appointment is three days ahead. Therefore, we need to infer the date three days prior to the appointment to find today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the date three days before a given future date. We need to calculate and subtract three days from the provided date while handling transitions between days, months, and potentially years. This requires a systematic approach to date manipulation, accounting for different month lengths and year changes. In Prolog, we can utilize rules and recursion to handle these date transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling easy manipulation.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days (in this case, three days) from a given date. This function should handle day, month, and year transitions gracefully.\n\n3. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Within the function, handle the subtraction of days by decrementing the day value first. If the resulting day is negative or reaches the end of the month, decrement the month and reset the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement specific rules to handle transitions across months and years. For instance, if subtracting days brings us from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year, the year should be decremented.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `subtract_days` function to subtract one day at a time until reaching the desired number of days (three days) subtraction.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February dates accurately. Leap years will have 29 days in February, affecting the subtraction logic.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the appropriate rules for transitioning between dates, accounting for different scenarios.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create comprehensive test cases to validate the `subtract_days` function, including scenarios involving different months, leap years, and year transitions. For instance, subtracting three days from April 13, 1985, should result in April 10, 1985.\n\n9. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a future date and interactively find the date three days prior, which is today's date.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to determine the correct date for today based on Jane's future appointment date, even when crossing month and year boundaries. This will provide a practical solution for real-world date calculation scenarios.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, given that today is April 10, 1985. We need to calculate the dates for April 11 and April 12 based on the given information. This involves understanding the basic incrementation of days and handling the month and year boundaries correctly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires simple date arithmetic involving day addition. We need to add one day to today's date to find tomorrow's date and then add another day for the day after tomorrow. The main consideration is to handle potential month and year boundaries when adding these days. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions seamlessly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. This structure should support addition operations for days.\n\n2. **Day Increment Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to a given date. This function should handle the normal increment and also manage the transition at the end of a month or year.\n\n3. **Recursive Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses the `increment_day` function to repeatedly add days. This function should decrement the `Days` count until it reaches 0, producing the final date as the `NewDate`.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Implement rules to handle the transition to the next month or year when adding days. For instance, if DD is 30 and you add one day, MM should increment to the next month, and DD should reset to 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February's date range appropriately. Leap years will have February set to 29 days, while non-leap years will have it at 28 days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rules for transitioning months or years when adding days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that verify the correctness of the `add_days` function, especially around month and year boundaries, and during leap years. For example, adding 2 days to `04/10/1985` should result in `04/12/1985`.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the dates for the following day and the day after tomorrow.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to handle basic date arithmetic, providing a solution to find the dates for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, while accounting for different months' lengths and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from today, given that today is April 10, 1985. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date. This means we are moving back in time, requiring us to adjust the days, months, and potentially the year accordingly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date arithmetic, specifically subtracting a certain number of days from a given date. It requires understanding how days, months, and years interact when performing such calculations, especially when crossing boundaries. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle these transitions and leverage the program's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling easy manipulation.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This function should handle the transitions between months and years when necessary. For example, if subtracting 10 days from April 10, we should end up in March, so the function should set MM to 03 and adjust DD and YYYY accordingly.\n\n3. **Month and Year Adjustments:**\n   - Implement rules to handle day subtractions that cross month and year boundaries. When subtracting days from the beginning of a month or year, the previous month or year should be selected.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to ensure that February is adjusted correctly during leap years when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that subtracts one day at a time until reaching the target number of days subtracted. This function will repeatedly apply the day subtraction function, keeping track of the remaining days to subtract.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to match the appropriate rules for date transitions based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases covering various scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and check if the program correctly handles leap years. For example, verify that subtracting 10 days from April 10, 1985, results in March 31, 1985.\n\n8. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Design a user-friendly input system where users can input a date and the number of days to subtract, receiving the resulting date after the subtraction.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting SWI-Prolog code will be able to perform date arithmetic, handling complex transitions and providing a practical solution to real-world date manipulation problems, leveraging the power of Prolog's search and reasoning abilities.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one month prior to Jane's appointment, which is three days after today. Today's date is April 10, 1985. To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from today's date. This operation may involve crossing month boundaries, which will require careful consideration.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date manipulation and understanding the concept of months, which can vary in length. Subtracting one month from a date may result in different days and months depending on the original date. For example, subtracting one month from February 28 would yield January 28. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle these transitions and calculate the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling easy manipulation and transitions.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Function:**\n   - Develop a function called `subtract_month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that handles the logic of subtracting one month from a given date.\n   - When subtracting a month, if the day is higher than the number of days in the month, it should be adjusted to the last day of that month. For example, subtracting a month from date(4, 30, 1985) should yield date(4, 30, 1985), as April only has 30 days.\n\n3. **Handling January Transition:**\n   - Implement special logic for January, where subtracting a month should also decrement the year by one. For instance, subtracting a month from date(1, 3, 1985) should result in date(12, 31, 1984).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a function to check if a year is a leap year, as this affects the number of days in February and thus the transitions in and out of that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion to build a rule that subtracts one month repeatedly until the target date is reached. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help find the appropriate transitions and adjust the date accordingly.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between different months and handling January and February in both normal and leap years.\n   - Ensure that the base case of the recursion is handled correctly, preventing an infinite loop.\n\n7. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Create a user-friendly interface for users to input a date and receive the date one month ago.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date one month prior to any given date, handling the complexities of month transitions, including leap years, effectively.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was one week ago from today, given that today is April 10, 1985. To find this date, we need to subtract seven days from April 10, 1985.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting a certain number of days from the given date. The key consideration is to handle the transition between weeks, which may cross month boundaries. In this case, subtracting seven days from April 10 would fall within the same month. Prolog can assist in solving this problem by providing rules for date arithmetic, including decrementing days and handling month transitions if needed.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date representation like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to describe dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This representation should support operations to subtract days.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one day from the given date. If the day is 1, it should reset to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Create a recursive function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that repeatedly subtracts one day using `decrement_day`. This function should decrement the `Days` count until it reaches zero, providing the desired past date.\n\n4. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Include rules in `decrement_day` to handle transitions between different months. This requires considering the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day values accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. Subtracting days from February 29 in a leap year, for instance, should result in February 22.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic and Prolog Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to apply the decrement day rules repeatedly.\n   - Leverage its search capabilities to find the correct path through the recursive tree, ensuring the proper date transition is applied.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_days` function with various scenarios, including transitions between months and leap years, to ensure the logic works correctly. For example, subtracting 7 days from April 10, 1985, should yield April 3, 1985.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate dates from a specified number of days in the past, accounting for month and year transitions and leap years. This functionality can be valuable for various applications involving date calculations.",

First, we need to calculate the date three days from now, which would be April 13, 1985. From there, we can determine the date one week from today. The additional days will be added to this calculated date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two sequential calculations: first, adding three days, and then adding seven days. We need a method to increment days while accounting for month and year transitions. Additionally, we should consider leap years to handle February's date range accurately. In Prolog, we can construct rules to manage these transitions and apply them in sequence.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should allow for flexible arithmetic operations on days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Increment Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle day increments across month boundaries and year transitions.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Implement a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, as this affects the number of days in February.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Define rules within the `increment_days` function to handle transitions to the next month or year when the days exceed the current month's or year's end.\n\n5. **Sequential Date Calculation:**\n   - To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the date three days from now by calling `increment_days` with the input date and 3 as the `Days` parameter.\n   - Then, we will call `increment_days` again with the new date and 7 as the `Days` parameter to find the date one week from today.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and backtracking capabilities to find the correct paths through the rules, especially when handling month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create comprehensive test cases to verify the correctness of the `increment_days` function, including scenarios involving month-end, year-end, and leap year transitions.\n   - Test the sequential date calculation by first adding three days and then adding seven days to ensure the correct final date is obtained.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can handle complex date calculations involving sequential increments and various date transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date for tomorrow, knowing that today is March 5, 1973, and it's Jane's second time this year witnessing a meteor shower. We need to calculate the date for the day after tomorrow in the format MM/DD/YYYY.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of two days from the given date. Since March has 31 days, we can simply add two days to arrive at the correct date. The main focus will be on handling the month and year boundaries to ensure the correctness of the result. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining a rule that increments the days appropriately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for basic arithmetic operations to add days.\n\n2. **Increment by Two Days:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the date by two days. If the day reaches the end of the month, it should reset to the first day of the next month. For example, March 31 + 2 days = April 2, 1973.\n\n3. **Handling Year Boundaries:**\n   - Include a consideration for year transitions. When incrementing past December 31, the year should be incremented accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years. This is important to handle February's date range correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly applies the two-day increment rule until the desired date is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date and the desired increment.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correctness of the two-day increment across different months and years, including leap years. For instance, test the transition from March 30 to April 1 and from December 30 to January 1, 1974, in a non-leap year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Guide the user to input a date in the MM/DD/YYYY format, ensuring the program can handle variations and errors in input.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date for tomorrow based on the given information about Jane's meteor shower experience.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane has witnessed a meteor shower twice in the year 1973, and today is the second occurrence, which means that yesterday was the first occurrence. Understanding that there are two events of seeing a meteor shower in 1973, and today is the latter one, we can deduce that yesterday was March 4, 1973.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves identifying a specific date that is associated with a recurring event, with the current occurrence being the second time it's happening in the year 1973. The key is to recognize that today is the second occurrence and deduce that yesterday was the first one. This requires logical reasoning and the ability to manipulate dates. In Prolog, we can construct rules to handle such scenarios, decrementing the date by one to find the previous occurrence.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `previous_occurrence(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that decrements the day by 1. If DD is not the first day of the month, simply decrement DD. If DD is the first day, decrement MM and reset DD to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Include rules to handle special cases, such as the transition from December 1 to November 30 and the handling of leap years for February.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Occurrences:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that continues to decrement the date until the desired first occurrence is found. This will require a counter to keep track of the occurrences and terminate the recursion when the second occurrence (today) is reached.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a predicate to check if a year is a leap year, enabling the correct handling of February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and backtracking mechanisms to explore different date possibilities and apply the correct decrement rules.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `previous_occurrence` function with various input dates corresponding to different occurrences, ensuring it correctly identifies the first occurrence.\n   - Verify the functionality for different months and years, including leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that finds the date of a past event given the current date and the number of occurrences of that event in the year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one year ago from today. Given that today is March 5, 1973 and Jane has already seen a meteor shower once this year, we need to calculate the date in the previous year that also witnessed a meteor shower. This involves understanding how dates revert exactly one year and identifying the same event in the previous year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a clear understanding of date arithmetic and the ability to revert a date by exactly one year. Additionally, we need to consider the occurrence of the meteor shower, which adds a layer of complexity. In Prolog, we can approach this by defining rules that handle date reverting and checking for specific events.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for arithmetic operations to subtract a year.\n\n2. **Revert Year Function:**\n   - Implement a function `revert_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts exactly one year from the given date. This function should handle the transition of days, months, and years correctly.\n\n3. **Check Meteor Shower Event:**\n   - Create a predicate `meteor_shower(date(MM, DD, YYYY))` that checks if a given date corresponds to Jane's second meteor shower event. This predicate will be true for specific dates.\n\n4. **Combining Logic:**\n   - Combine the date reversion and event checking by applying the `meteor_shower` predicate to both the original date and the reverted date. If both dates correspond to meteor shower events, we have found the correct date one year ago.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to determine if the year is a leap year, as this affects the number of days in February and thus could impact the calculation.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and search to find the correct date that satisfies the conditions of the second meteor shower event one year ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that verify the correctness of the `revert_year` function across different months and years, including leap years.\n   - Ensure that the `meteor_shower` predicate works correctly by testing it with the known date of today (March 5, 1973) and the reverted date.\n\n8. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Guide the user on how to input the current date and provide a clear indication of the resulting date from one year ago.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will become a helpful tool to calculate a specific past date based on the current date and a given event, showcasing SWI-Prolog's capabilities in handling date arithmetic and logical conditions.",

The key consideration is ensuring that the subtraction crosses over the week boundary correctly. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle this date arithmetic, including week transitions and potential month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for subtracting days.\n\n2. **Subtract One Week:**\n   - Define a rule to subtract seven days from a given date. If the subtraction results in a date prior to the beginning of the week (e.g., Sunday), then adjust it accordingly.\n\n3. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when subtracting days. For example, if today is March 5, subtracting seven days should consider the days in February and adjust the month accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February.

        "question": "Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after today, where today is March 5, 1973, and it's Jane's second time witnessing a meteor shower this year. We need to calculate the date and year 24 hours later, considering the specific reference to Jane's experience.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward date calculation, adding 24 hours to the given date. However, the reference to Jane's experience implies that we need to find the subsequent occurrence of the meteor shower. This suggests a recursive approach, where we start from the given date and repeatedly add 24-hour intervals until we find the second instance of the meteor shower in 1973. After finding this date, we can add another 24 hours to it to obtain the desired result. In Prolog, we can implement this using recursive rules and date manipulation functions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds 24 hours to a given date, considering the different days in months and handling the transition to the next month or year accordingly.\n\n3. **Find Second Meteor Shower:**\n   - Implement a recursive function that starts from the given date and repeatedly adds 24 hours until it finds the second occurrence of the meteor shower in the year 1973.\n   - This function should keep track of the count of meteor shower occurrences and stop when it reaches the second occurrence.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, as it affects the number of days in February and might impact the calculation.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and pattern matching to repeatedly apply the `increment_date` function until the second meteor shower is found.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the `increment_date` function and the recursive function for finding the second meteor shower. Test for normal days, month transitions, and the leap year effect.\n\n7. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Guide the user to input a specific date, and let the program calculate the date 24 hours later, considering Jane's meteor shower experiences in the year 1973.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to solve the problem by finding the second meteor shower event in 1973 and then adding 24 hours to determine the correct date and year.

There are no special cases or transitions across months or years. In Prolog, this can be achieved using date manipulation functions with a basic addition operation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent specific dates.\n   - Ensure this structure allows for basic date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Implement a function that increments the day component by 1.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after January 21, 2011. Since there are no special transitions or intervals involved, we simply need to add 24 hours to the given date. This falls within the same month and year, without crossing any boundaries. The resulting date is January 22, 2011.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis scenario involves a straightforward addition of time (24 hours) to a given date. There are no month or year transitions to consider, making the calculation relatively simple. In Prolog, we can implement a rule that adds a specified number of hours to a date, focusing on the addition of hours within the same month and year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(Date, Time)` to represent both the date and time. The date could be represented as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, and the time as `time(HH, MM, SS)`.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for basic arithmetic operations on the time component.\n\n2. **Add Time Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_time(datetime(D1, T1), Hours, datetime(D2, T2))` that adds a specified number of hours (`Hours`) to a datetime object. This function should handle the addition of hours within the same day.\n\n3. **Normal Day Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule that handles the transition to the next day if the time exceeds 24 hours. This rule should increment the day and reset the time to the start of the day (00:00:00).\n\n4. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine when the time exceeds 24 hours and apply the appropriate rule for transitioning to the next day.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding different time intervals within the same day and crossing the 24-hour boundary to the next day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can add a specified number of hours to a given date and time, handling the transition to the next day if needed.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, where today is confirmed to be June 18, 2019, despite another belief that it is June 19, 2019. To find the date one week from June 18, 2019, we need to calculate seven days ahead from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of seven days to the current date. However, we need to ensure that the correct current date is used, which is confirmed to be June 18, 2019. The logic required is to handle the increment of days and ensure it does not cross any month or year boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for date arithmetic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations that add days to a given date.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function called `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - The function should handle the increment of days, months, and years accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition of days when the month or year boundary is crossed. For example, if the current date is December 31, adding seven days should result in January 7 of the following year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a function to check if a year is a leap year, as this affects the number of days in February and, thus, could impact date calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a recursive mechanism in the `add_days` function to add one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the appropriate transition rules based on the current date and the desired number of days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including transitions within the same month, across months, and into the next year, both in normal years and leap years.\n\n8. **User Input:**\n   - Prompt the user to confirm the current date, and then use the `add_days` function to calculate the date one week from today.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine a future date based on the correct present date, accounting for different scenarios and special cases, such as month and year transitions and leap years.",

Since Jane is correct and today is indeed June 18, 2019, the date 24 hours later would be June 19, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis scenario involves a straightforward day increment within the same month and year. However, we need to establish which date is correct between Jane's and John's beliefs. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing a rule that selects the correct date and then calculates the future date based on that correction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Check and Correct Date:**\n   - Write a rule that checks if the input date is June 18 or June 19, 2019. Based on this condition, select the correct date.\n\n3. **Increment for 24 Hours:**\n   - Implement a function or rule to increment the selected correct date by 24 hours. This should result in June 19 or June 20, depending on the initial date.\n\n4. **Handling Same-Day Transitions:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the scenario where the initial date is already the correct date (e.g., both Jane and John agree on the date). In this case, the date 24 hours later would be the following day.\n\n5. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not required for this specific scenario, implement general rules for handling transitions across months and years. This ensures the program can handle more complex date calculations.\n\n6. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years to correctly manage February dates in general cases.\n\n7. **Recursive Date Calculation:**\n   - Use recursion to compute the date 24 hours later, based on the corrected date.\n\n8. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search capabilities to determine the correct date among the options provided and then apply the appropriate rules.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the code with scenarios covering the correction of the date (June 18 vs. June 19) and a simple day increment.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that arbitrates between conflicting date beliefs and calculates the correct date 24 hours later.

For example, if subtracting 31 days from June 19, the month should revert to May and the day should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years. This is important for accurately handling February when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `subtract_days` function to subtract one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to match the appropriate rules for transitioning months and years when subtracting days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `subtract_days` function, including scenarios where the subtraction crosses month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap year boundaries.\n\n8. **Finding the Date a Month Ago:**\n   - Apply the `subtract_days` function with the parameter set to 30 to find the date one month ago from June 19, 2019.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine a date from the past based on the given date and the number of days to subtract. This will involve implementing date arithmetic operations and leveraging Prolog's strengths in managing complex transitions and pattern matching.",

For example, if the input is `date(6, 19, 2019)`, the output should be `date(6, 20, 2019)`.\n\n3. **Handling Overflows:**\n   - Ensure that the rule handles cases where the day exceeds the number of days in a month, though this is not relevant for the current scenario.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Leap years do not affect this specific calculation, but including a general leap year check could make the code more robust.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although recursion is not necessary for this simple calculation, it can be implemented by repeatedly applying the increment rule until the desired number of hours (24) is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Not needed for this straightforward calculation.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day increments within the same month and across different months. For example, incrementing June 30 by 24 hours should result in July 1.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a simple Prolog program that adds 24 hours to a given date, focusing on correctly incrementing the day while maintaining the month and year. This will provide a basic but practical solution for date calculations in SWI-Prolog.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the current date, understanding that Jane perceives May 6, 1992, as if it were yesterday. We need to calculate the date ten years after May 6, 1992, which represents today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is ten years removed from a known past date. While this doesn't involve a complex interval like weeks or months, it requires a straightforward but consistent approach to adding years to a date. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by defining a rule that increments the year component of a date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for basic arithmetic operations, especially year increments.\n\n2. **Increment Year Function:**\n   - Implement a function `increment_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewYear)` that adds one year to a given date. This function should handle the transition of days and months at the beginning of a new year.\n\n3. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Create a recursive function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that uses `increment_year` repeatedly to add years. This function should accept the starting date and the number of years to add, and return the resulting date.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the day and month values are adjusted correctly when incrementing the year. For instance, if the starting date is May 31, the next year should begin on June 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Adjustment:**\n   - Include logic to handle leap years so that the correct number of days are accounted for in the year increment.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's pattern matching to apply the year incrementation rule correctly, based on the starting date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that verify the functionality of `increment_year` and `add_years` across different scenarios, including transitions into and out of leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - To find today's date, invoke the `add_years` function with the starting date May 6, 1992, and a parameter of 10 years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates today's date based on Jane's perception of time, accounting for year transitions and leap years.

The task is to determine the date for tomorrow, ten years after May 6, 1992.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from the present date, considering that Jane considers yesterday to be May 6, 1992. The goal is to calculate the date 10 days prior to May 6, 1992.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a historical date based on a given reference date (May 6, 1992). We need to subtract 10 days from this reference date, considering the month and year boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for date arithmetic, ensuring that the correct transitions between months and years are handled.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations to subtract days.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition of days, rolling over to the previous month or year when necessary.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to manage transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, if the date is May 6, then 10 days ago would be April 26 of the same year.\n   - Account for cases where the starting date is near the beginning of the month or year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to determine if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and requires special handling.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Use recursion within the `subtract_days` function to subtract one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to match the appropriate rules for date transitions. Pattern matching will help determine if a year is a leap year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `subtract_days` function, including scenarios involving different months, years, and leap years. For instance, testing subtracting 10 days from May 6, 1992, should yield April 26, 1992.\n\n8. **User Input and Communication:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a reference date and receive the date 10 days prior. Ensure the program's output is clear and understandable.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine a date from a historical perspective, accounting for various date transitions and leap years. This will be a practical tool for mental calculations like Jane's, bringing clarity to retrospective date calculations.",

To find this date, we need to calculate ten years minus one month. This involves understanding year and month transitions and ensuring the correct handling of these transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date that is both a certain number of years in the past and a certain number of months prior to that date. This involves multiple date arithmetic operations and handling the boundaries of months and years. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle year and month decrements, considering the number of days in each month and the transition between decades.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, suitable for handling arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Decrement Year Function:**\n   - Write a function `decrement_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from a given date. If the current year is not a leap year and the next year is a leap year, account for the extra day in February.\n\n3. **Subtraction of Months:**\n   - Develop a function `subtract_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Months, NewDate)` that subtracts the specified number of months from a given date. This function should handle the transition between months and adjust the day accordingly when moving to a shorter month.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Implement specific rules to handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month, as well as the transition between years, accounting for different month lengths.\n\n5. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Write a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap year transitions.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Combine the year decrement function and the month subtraction function in a recursive manner to achieve the desired date calculation, subtracting multiple months and years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to find and apply the correct rules for both year and month transitions.

The task is to determine the date one week ago from today, which is May 6, 2002. This involves calculating a date ten years in the past and then subtracting seven days from that date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a two-step approach: first, subtracting ten years, and then subtracting seven days. Each step involves handling date transitions across months and years, ensuring that the correct dates are calculated. In Prolog, we can define rules for subtracting years and days while handling various calendar-related scenarios.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, allowing for easy manipulation.\n\n2. **Subtracting Years:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract years from a given date. This rule should handle the transition of months and days when subtracting years. For example, May 6, 2002, minus ten years should result in May 6, 1992.\n\n3. **Subtracting Days:**\n   - Develop a separate rule or modification to the previous rule to subtract days from a given date, handling month and year transitions as needed. Subtract seven days from the date obtained in step 2 to find the date one week ago.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the subtraction rules to manage transitions between months and years. This includes understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing boundaries.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates accurately during leap years when subtracting days or years.\n\n6. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Use recursion to subtract multiple years or days, ensuring that the correct transitions are made even across multiple boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules for subtracting years and days, especially across different months and years.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure the correct dates are calculated after subtracting years and days.\n   - Verify that the program handles leap years accurately when performing the subtractions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can handle complex date calculations, involving both year and day subtractions, while accounting for various calendar scenarios and leap years.

Therefore, a month before Christmas Eve would be November 24, 1937.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is exactly one month before a given date. We need a logic that can handle month transitions and correctly identify the date based on the given scenario. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and rules to manage these calculations, especially when crossing month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should facilitate operations involving month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the date encounters the end of a month, it should correctly update the month and day accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from December 24, 1937, should result in November 24, 1937.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that when subtracting a month, the day component resets to the last day of the previous month if needed. For instance, February 30 should become February 28 or 29 depending on the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February dates correctly. Leap years have 29 days in February, while non-leap years have 28.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-month subtraction rule until the desired number of months is subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct path when subtracting months and handling different scenarios, including transitions into and out of leap years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the month subtraction functionality across various dates, including cases where months and years change (e.g., January 31 to December 31).\n   - Verify the correctness of the logic for subtracting multiple months, such as two or three months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one month prior to a given date, accounting for different month lengths, leap years, and recursive month subtraction.

When adding 7 days to December 24, the result should be December 31.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the following year, considering that the next week will begin the new year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly needed for this specific date, include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly in general cases.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules within the `add_days` function to handle the addition of multiple days, ensuring that the correct transitions are made between dates.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's pattern matching and rule application will ensure that the correct rules are triggered based on the given date, especially when transitioning from December 31 to January 1.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including dates near month and year transitions, as well as leap years, to ensure the logic holds.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one week from a given date, accounting for month and year transitions and leap years. This will involve implementing rules for date arithmetic and leveraging Prolog's capabilities to handle these transitions seamlessly.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Christmas Eve of 1937. Christmas Eve is celebrated on December 24 every year. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be December 25, 1937, which is commonly known as Christmas Day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of 24 hours from the given date in 1937.

This would cover most regular date transitions.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include separate rules for handling transitions to the next month and year. For instance, December 31 should transition to January 1 of the following year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly needed for this specific date, include a rule to handle leap years to generalize the logic.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that, in the MM/DD/YYYY format, forms a palindrome. This means that the month, day, and year are the same when read forwards and backwards. Such a date occurs only once every year, and in the year 2020, this format is unique to the date August 08, 2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the date that satisfies the palindrome condition in the MM/DD/YYYY format for the year 2020. This requires recognizing the palindromic pattern and mapping it to the corresponding date. In Prolog, we can define rules based on the palindrome pattern to infer the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Palindrome Pattern:**\n   - Analyze the palindrome pattern in the MM/DD/YYYY format and identify the common traits of such dates. For example, the middle two digits represent the month, and they are symmetric around the central slash.\n\n2. **Date Inference:**\n   - Write a rule that infers the date from the palindrome pattern. Given the symmetry, the middle two digits (MM) must be even, and the day (DD) is found in the first half of the pattern.\n   - Apply this logic to conclude that the date is August 08, 2020.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the logic, ensuring that the inferred date is indeed a palindrome and the only such occurrence in the year 2020.\n\n4. **User Interaction:**\n   - Prompt the user to input the year for which they want to find the palindrome date. Read the input and proceed with the inference logic.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Briefly explain that the leap year status of the given year doesn't affect the palindrome pattern recognition.\n\n6. **Output Format:**\n   - Ensure the output presents the date in the MM/DD/YYYY format, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that identifies the palindrome date in the MM/DD/YYYY format for a given year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nToday is a palindrome day in the year 2020 because the date in the MMDDYYYY format reads the same forwards and backwards. This occurs on days like 02/02/2020 or 11/11/2011. The task is to determine the date exactly one month prior to this palindrome day in 2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that was a palindrome day in the recent past, specifically one month ago. This involves understanding the palindrome date pattern and then subtracting one month from that date. Palindrome days occur when the month and day have the same values, such as 02/02 or 11/11. In Prolog, we can use these patterns to identify the palindrome days and then apply rules for subtracting months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Palindrome Days:**\n   - Write a predicate `is_palindrome_day(MMDDYYYY)` that checks if a given date in MMDDYYYY format is a palindrome day. This can be done by comparing `MM` and `DD` values.\n\n2. **Identify Palindrome Date:**\n   - Use the current year (2020) and the above predicate to identify the palindrome day one month ago. For example, check if 02/02/2020 was a palindrome day.\n\n3. **Subtract One Month:**\n   - Develop a rule to subtract one month from a given date. This may involve resetting the month and adjusting the day and year accordingly. If the date is at the beginning of a month, decrement the year and set the month to December.\n\n4. **Handle Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is handled correctly when subtracting a month. For instance, if the date moves from February 29 to January, the day should be adjusted to the last day of January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly. February would have 29 days in 2020, which is a leap year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to subtract one month repeatedly until the desired date is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and the defined palindrome predicate to find the palindrome date one month ago.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the code with various dates, including those that were palindrome days and those that weren't, to ensure the logic works correctly. Verify that the program can identify palindrome days and subtract months accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that identifies palindrome days and calculates the date one month prior to a given palindrome day in 2020.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nToday's date is a palindrome in the MM/DD/YYYY format, which means that the month, day, and year are the same when read forwards and backwards. This occurs only once every year. The task is to determine the date 24 hours after this special palindrome day in the year 2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that the palindrome date in 2020 would have the same digits for month, day, and year. This means that we only need to increment the time component by 24 hours while keeping the date components (month, day, and year) unchanged. In Prolog, this can be achieved using date manipulation functions and simple arithmetic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Palindrome Date:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a given date in the MM/DD/YYYY format is a palindrome date. This can be done by comparing the month, day, and year digits forward and backward.\n\n2. **Increment Time:**\n   - Use date manipulation functions to increment the time component by 24 hours while keeping the date components constant. This may involve separate handling of hours, minutes, and seconds if working with detailed time representation.\n\n3. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Ensure that the code accounts for the potential change in the AM/PM indicator when crossing the midnight boundary.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Check if the palindrome date happens to fall on a leap year, and ensure that the solution handles this case correctly without any issues.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct palindrome date in 2020 and then apply the time increment. The search will help match the palindrome pattern and apply the correct transformation.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the code with the actual palindrome date in 2020 to ensure that the time is correctly incremented while keeping the date components intact.\n   - Verify that the code handles other palindrome dates correctly, both with and without leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that identifies palindrome dates and correctly increments the time by 24 hours, providing an accurate and fun solution to this unique date calculation problem.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date for the first day of the year 1900, given that today is the last day of the year 1899. As December has 31 days, the last day of the year falls on December 31, 1899. Therefore, tomorrow will be the first day of January in the year 1900.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves handling the transition from the last day of one year to the first day of the next year. It requires understanding year transitions and setting the correct month and day values accordingly. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage this specific transition and leverage Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct logic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, allowing for easy manipulation and transitions.\n\n2. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Write a specific rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the following year. This rule should increment the year and set the month to January while resetting the day to 1.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a general rule for incrementing the day by one. This rule would handle all day increments that are not year transitions.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly applicable to this scenario, include a leap year check to handle February dates during leap years. This will ensure the program's correctness in other contexts.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's recursive capabilities to construct a rule that calculates tomorrow's date based on today's date. The search capabilities will help in identifying the year-end transition and applying the special rule for this scenario.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that verify the year-end transition, such as checking the transition from December 31, 1899, to January 1, 1900.\n   - Test the non-transition scenario by verifying the increment from December 30 to December 31 in the same year.\n\n7. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Develop a user-friendly mechanism for users to input the date and receive the output, ensuring clarity in both input and output.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date for tomorrow, especially when transitioning from the last day of one year to the first day of the next.

As December has 31 days, the date of yesterday was December 30, 1899.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the previous date when today is known. It requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the transition from one month to another correctly. In this case, we need to go back one day from the last day of December, which falls in the same month. Prolog can be used to define rules that handle these date transitions and calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle decrements in days and months.\n\n2. **Handling Regular Days:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day from the current date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day value.\n\n3. **Month-End Handling:**\n   - Define a rule to handle the situation when the current day is the last day of the month. In this case, the month and year remain the same, and the day is set to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from the last day of the year 1899. Since December in the year 1899 has 31 days, 10 days ago was likely within the same month. Therefore, we need to subtract 10 days from December 31, 1899, which will involve adjusting the day count and potentially the month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date that is a certain number of days in the past from a given date, which happens to be the last day of the year. This involves understanding how days are counted backward and making adjustments for months and potentially years. In Prolog, we can construct rules to handle these date arithmetic operations, ensuring that the correct transitions are made between months and years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for operations involving day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Function:**\n   - Implement a function to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This function should handle the transitions between days, months, and potentially years when subtracting days.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to handle transitions to the previous month and year when subtracting days. For example, subtracting days from December should lead to November and the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Adjustment:**\n   - Include a leap year check in the day subtraction function. This is crucial for accurately determining the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the day subtraction function until the desired number of days (in this case, 10) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Ensure that the code handles edge cases, such as the last day of the year, and adjusts the year and month accordingly when subtracting days.\n\n7. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find and apply the correct rules for date transitions. Pattern matching will be essential in identifying the appropriate cases for subtraction.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the function with various scenarios, including transitions across months and years, and verify that the correct dates are calculated.\n   - Specifically, test the code with the last day of the year 1899 to confirm that it handles this boundary case correctly.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog code will be able to calculate the date that was 10 days ago from the last day of 1899, accounting for the necessary transitions and special cases.

Therefore, the desired date is 11/30/1899 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one month before the last day of the year 1899. We need a logic that accounts for the number of days in each month and subtracts one month accordingly, adjusting the year if necessary. In Prolog, we can define rules for month subtraction and handle the year transition at the end of the year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date representation like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to handle different months and years.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is December, set the month to November and decrement the year by one. Otherwise, simply decrement the month while keeping the year intact.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - When subtracting a month, ensure that the day component doesn't exceed the days in the resulting month. Adjust the day to the maximum number of days in that month if needed (e.g., from February 30 to February 28).\n\n4. **Special Case for December:**\n   - Handle the unique case of December, where subtracting a month involves decrementing the year and changing the month to November.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although the problem doesn't explicitly mention leap years, it's important to include a rule to handle them.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year prior to the last day of the year 1899. Since December has 31 days and the last day of 1899 falls on December 31, one year ago from this date would be December 31, 1898.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one year before a given date, specifically the last day of the year 1899. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the transition from one year to another. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage these transitions and calculate the desired date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle year transitions and month boundaries.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the transition from December to January across different years. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, and `YYYY` is not 1 (indicating not the first year), then the date should change to January 1 of the previous year.\n\n3. **Normal Case:**\n   - Define a rule for the normal scenario, where we decrement the year by 1 and keep the month and day unchanged, as long as the month is not December.\n\n4. **December Transitions:**\n   - Handle transitions when the current date is in December. If `DD` is not 31, decrement the day by the remaining number of days in December (31 - DD). If `DD` is 31, special handling is required: set `MM` to 11 (November), `DD` to 30, and decrement `YYYY` by 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to handle February correctly. In a leap year, February has 29 days, which affects the year decrement logic.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and search to find the correct path through the rules, applying the appropriate transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that verify the correct behavior of the program when decrementing years across different months and years, including leap years. For example, test the transition from December 31, 1899, to December 31, 1898.\n\n8. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Design a user-friendly way for users to input the date they want to investigate, and provide clear feedback for the date one year ago.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to handle date calculations involving year transitions and provide the correct date one year prior to the last day of 1899.

This involves incrementing the month and year when crossing this boundary.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a recursive function to add a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle the increment of days, months, and years accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's date range accurately. Leap years will have February represented as 02/29/YYYY, whereas non-leap years will have 02/28/YYYY.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Prolog Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's recursive capabilities and search features to match and apply the correct rules for date transitions. The search function will help find the appropriate solution based on the initial date and the number of days to add.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that verify the functionality of the code across different scenarios: adding days across month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap years. For instance, adding 7 days from December 31, 1899, should result in January 7, 1900.\n\n7. **User Input and Interaction:**\n   - Develop a user-friendly input mechanism where users can specify a starting date and the number of days to add. The program should then display the resulting date after the specified time.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to handle date calculations involving transitions between months and years, providing an accurate solution to the problem of finding the date one week from the last day of 1899.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the last day of the year 1899. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the date will change from December 31, 1899, to January 1, 1900.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple date transition from one day to the next, but with a special consideration for the year change from 1899 to 1900. The transition occurs at the end of December, which leads into the next year. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle this specific scenario, ensuring that the year is correctly incremented when crossing over to January 1.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle both day and year transitions.\n\n2. **Handling Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day by one. If the day reaches the last day of the month, set it to 1 and increment the month. For December, a special condition should be set: if DD is 31, increment the year and set MM to January.\n\n3. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Leap years do not affect the transition from December 31 to January 1, so no additional logic is required here.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the day increment rule until the desired number of days (24 hours) has been reached.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's pattern matching can be used to apply the correct rules for the transition into January and the year change.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is produced when incrementing days across the end of the year, both with and without leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately determines the date 24 hours after a given date, with a specific focus on handling the transition from the last day of the year to the first day of the following year.

As the concert was delayed by one day, yesterday's date would have been June 02, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward delay of one day from a known past date. The logic required is to decrement the day by one while keeping the month and year intact. In Prolog, this can be managed by defining a simple rule for day decrement and applying it to the known past date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, suitable for basic arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one day from the given date. The function should decrement the day (`DD`) while keeping the month and year unchanged.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that if the day is already set to 1, decrementing should reset it to the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Leap years need not be considered in this scenario, as we are only decrementing by one day.\n\n5. **Application of Decrement Logic:**\n   - Apply the decrement day function to the known past date, June 1, 1943, to find the date of yesterday.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the functionality of the `decrement_day` function, especially around month boundaries and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that can determine the date of yesterday based on the given concert delay scenario. The focus will be on defining the day decrement function and applying it to the known past date.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to today's concert date, which was delayed by one day from the originally scheduled date of June 1, 1943. As the concert was delayed by one day, today's date is June 2, 1943. To find the date one month ago, we need to calculate the date for May 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding a date that is one month prior to the current date, which falls in the same month and year, without any special transitions.

For example, for June 2, the previous date should be June 1.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from the current date. This rule should handle the standard month subtraction, considering the number of days in each month.\n\n4. **Recursive Month Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly applies the month subtraction rule until the desired number of months is subtracted. In this case, we need to subtract one month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Include a function to determine if the year is a leap year, as this affects the number of days in February and may impact the calculation.\n\n6. **Application of Prolog's Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's pattern matching to apply the appropriate rules based on the current date and the one-day delay.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for regular month subtractions within the same year, as well as cases that cross February to validate the leap year check.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date one month prior to the delayed concert date, focusing on accurate month subtraction and considering the one-day delay.

Today's date is June 2, 1943, and we need to find the date one week from now.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on the current date, which is a simple delay of one day. However, we also need to determine the date one week later. This requires understanding date progression and potentially handling transitions across weeks, months, and years. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date increments and leverage its search capabilities to apply these rules correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like adding days and weeks.\n\n2. **Simple Date Increment:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day by one, considering the transition to the next month or year if necessary. For example, if `DD` is 31, the next day should be January 1 of the following year.\n\n3. **Add Weeks Function:**\n   - Implement a function to add a specified number of weeks to a given date. This function should recursively add seven days for each week.\n\n4. **Handling Week Transitions:**\n   - When adding weeks, handle the transition from one week to the next, ensuring that the correct date is determined even when crossing week boundaries.\n\n5. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include rules to handle transitions between months and years when incrementing days. For instance, if June 30 is delayed by one day, the date should become July 1 of the same year.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to handle February dates accurately when adding days or weeks.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between days, months, and years, as well as leap years, to ensure the correctness of the date calculations.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one week from today, considering the initial delay of one day and handling subsequent date transitions.

For example, July 9, 1972, falls on a Tuesday, i.e., `weekday(date(9, 7, 1972)) = tuesday`.\n\n4. **Calculate One Month Back:**\n   - Develop a rule to calculate the date one month prior. This rule should decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly, considering the number of days in the previous month. If the starting day is at the end of the month, the rule should handle the transition to the previous month, potentially requiring year subtraction.\n\n5. **Handle Week Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the week boundary crossing. As July starts on a Tuesday, going one month back will involve moving to the previous week in June.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's days accurately. This will affect the calculation of days from February to June.\n\n7. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules and Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the correct path and apply the appropriate month and week transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with different starting dates to cover various month and week scenarios, including different starting weekdays and leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles dates like June 25, 1972, which requires moving across week boundaries.\n\n9. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Design a user-friendly input system where users can provide a date in the required format, and the program outputs the date one month prior.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to calculate the date a month ago, accounting for month transitions, week boundaries, and leap years, providing a practical solution to Jane's appointment scheduling scenario.",

The analysis focuses on understanding how to handle year transitions and ensuring the correct date is determined. In Prolog, we can leverage date manipulation functions and rules to manage these transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This rule should handle the transition from July 1972 to July 1971, decrementing the year by one.\n\n3. **Month and Day Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the month and day components remain accurate when subtracting one year. July 9, 1971, should remain unchanged since it's not a month-end or year-end transition.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if the given year is a leap year.

To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate the date that falls exactly seven days after July 9, 1972. This calculation involves understanding weekly transitions and potential month-end boundaries.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires adding seven days to the given date while considering different month lengths. We need to handle the transition from one week to the next and determine how it interacts with the end of July. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules for date arithmetic, taking into account the special case of different weeks and months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations that add a specified number of days to a given date.\n\n2. **Week and Month Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to handle both week and month transitions. If the current date is July 31 (the last day of July), then the week and month should both increment after adding seven days.\n\n3. **Day Overflow Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the day component overflows due to a month having fewer days than the current day. For instance, August only has 31 days, so after July 31, the day should reset to 1 while the month increments.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which will affect the number of days in February and potentially impact the date calculation.\n\n5. **Recursive Date Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that adds one day at a time to the input date, continuing until the desired number of days (in this case, 7) is reached.\n   - This function should handle the transitions mentioned above and adjust the date components accordingly.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to explore different possibilities and apply the correct rules based on the input date and desired number of days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the recursive date addition function, including scenarios like crossing month boundaries and leap years.

        "question": "Jane scheduled 3 apointments with 5 poeple for tomorrow (Tue, 7/9/1972). What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane has scheduled appointments for tomorrow, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to calculate the date and time after a full day has passed from the given tomorrow. This will involve adding 24 hours to the time component of the date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires understanding how to manipulate dates, especially when dealing with time increments of hours. We need to add 24 hours to the provided date, considering potential transitions in the time and day components. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and arithmetic operations to handle this scenario.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent dates and times. This structure should account for different months, days, years, hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n2. **Add Time Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_time(datetime(HH, MM, SS), TimeIncrement, NewTime)` that adds a specified time increment (in hours) to a given datetime. This function should handle the addition of hours, taking into account the transition of minutes and seconds when necessary.\n\n3. **Convert Datetime to Date:**\n   - Write a function `date_from_datetime(datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, _, _, _), date(MM, DD, YYYY))` to extract the date component from the full datetime structure.\n\n4. **Handling Day and Month Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the functions account for transitions at the end of the day (midnight), which may involve changing the date to the next day or month. Handle cases where the time component rolls over (e.g., 23:59:59 to 00:00:00).\n\n5. **Leap Year and Time Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly. Also, handle leap seconds, which are occasional extra seconds added to the time to account for Earth's irregular rotations.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly add hours until the required time increment of 24 hours is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and arithmetic operations to calculate the correct time and date transitions. Search capabilities will help find the appropriate solutions based on the input date and time.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include various test cases to validate the correctness of the time addition, especially around month and day transitions, leap years, and potential leap seconds.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that manipulates datetimes, focusing on adding time increments and handling various transitions. This will result in a system that can determine the accurate date 24 hours after the given appointment dates.",

We need to calculate the date for the next day, considering the time of day and handling any potential changes in the month or year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a full day to the current date and time. However, we need to account for the time of day and ensure that we don't accidentally add a day twice, considering that the current time is already in the afternoon.

To find yesterday's date, we need to subtract one day from May 4, 2004.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one day prior to the given time and date. We need a logic that handles basic date arithmetic, subtracting one day while considering the month and year boundaries. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date manipulation, including day decrements and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent the given time and date.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from the given date. If the date is at the beginning of the month, decrement the month accordingly and update the day. For example, subtracting one day from May 1 should result in April 30.\n   - Handle the year transition when subtracting days from December.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February.\n\n4. **Date Arithmetic Functions:**\n   - Develop functions to perform basic date arithmetic, including subtracting days, in a recursive manner.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and backtracking capabilities to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules for date transitions.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as transitions between months and years, and check if the program correctly handles leap years.\n   - Verify the behavior of the program for dates like May 4, 2004, and confirm that it correctly identifies the date as May 3, 2004.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a time and date and receives the date of the previous day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates yesterday's date based on the given time and date, accounting for various transitions and special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from the current local time of 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004. To find this date, we need to subtract 10 days from May 4, 2004, considering the time of day in our calculations.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a unique scenario where we have the current time of day available. We need to subtract 10 days while considering the time of day and handling transitions across days, months, and potentially years. The key is to manage the time of day accurately during these transitions. In Prolog, we can leverage date and time manipulation functions along with conditional rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Represent Time:**\n   - Represent time as a structure like `time(Hour, Minute, Second)`.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle arithmetic operations accurately.\n\n2. **Convert Time:**\n   - Write a function to convert the given time (3:02 pm) into a numerical value in hours, considering the time conversion from 12-hour to 24-hour format.\n\n3. **Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a combined structure like `datetime(Date, Time)` to represent both the date and time of day.\n   - Define another structure, `dateonly(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent dates without the time of day, which will be useful for comparisons and calculations.\n\n4. **Subtraction of Days with Time Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a certain number of days from a given datetime, taking into account the time of day.\n   - If the time of day is after the 10th hour (i.e., 22 hours or more have passed in the current day), then the date should move to the next day after subtraction.\n   - Handle cases where subtraction results in going back to the previous day due to time. For example, subtracting 10 days from a date with a time of 14:02 should consider going back to the previous day twice.\n\n5. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle month and year transitions during the date subtraction. This requires checking if the date is the last day of the month or the last day of the year and adjusting accordingly.\n\n6. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to handle February dates accurately during leap years.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic and Prolog Search:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the correct path through different date and time transitions.\n   - Ensure that the time of day is accurately maintained or adjusted as needed during the recursive calculations.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases covering various scenarios, including transitions across days, months, and years, and cases where the time of day plays a role in the calculation.\n   - Verify the correctness of the program for different input times and dates.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can travel back in time, considering both date and time of day transitions, and provide an accurate date 10 days ago while accounting for these factors.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one month prior to the current local time, which is 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004. To find this date, we need to calculate the date one month before May 4, 2004, considering the month's specific number of days and potential year transition.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date manipulation and understanding the number of days in each month. We have a specific time mentioned (3:02 pm), but the focus is on calculating the date one month ago. In Prolog, we can utilize date manipulation functions and rules to handle month transitions and determine the correct previous date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent the time and date.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle arithmetic operations for date manipulation.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the date is in January, decrement the year by 1 and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - When subtracting a month, ensure that the day component is adjusted accordingly. For example, if the starting date is March 31, the resulting date should be February 29 (considering it's not a leap year).\n\n4. **Leap Year and Day Adjustment:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle leap years, where February is adjusted to have 29 days. This rule should also handle non-leap years, ensuring that February has 28 days.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find and apply the correct month subtraction based on the current date. The search will help determine the appropriate transition rules for different months.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions through different months and years, and handle both leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly subtracts one month from dates like March 31, February 28, and January 31.\n\n7. **User Input and Time Ignorance:**\n   - Since the problem focuses on finding the date one month ago, the specific time mentioned (3:02 pm) can be ignored in the code.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one year prior to today, considering the current local time of 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current date while accounting for the time of day. Since the time is after 3:00 pm, we can consider the entire day has already passed, making today May 4, 2004. Therefore, one year ago from today was May 4, 2003.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain duration (one year) in the past, considering the current time of day. We need to determine how the time of day affects our calculations, especially when crossing over into different days. In this case, since the time is past 3:00 pm, we can conclude that the entire day has progressed, and thus we subtract one full year. Prolog can assist in this calculation by providing rules for date arithmetic and handling time-based scenarios.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent the current date and time.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle time-based calculations and conversions.\n\n2. **Convert Time to Hours:**\n   - Write a function to convert the minutes and seconds into hours (e.g., 3:02 pm would be converted to 15.0333 hours).\n\n3. **Check Time Threshold:**\n   - Implement a rule that checks the time of day in hours. If it's 12:00 am (0:00 hours), no adjustment is needed. If the time is past 12:00 pm (12:00 hours or more), then the entire day has progressed, and the date should be incremented by one.\n\n4. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This will decrement the year by one while keeping the month and day unchanged.\n\n5. **Handling Time and Date Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the rules for time and date transitions are applied correctly, considering the time threshold. The date should be adjusted appropriately based on whether the time has crossed the midpoint of the day or not.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates accurately during leap years.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the date and time transitions, ensuring that the correct date one year ago is calculated.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules based on the input time and date. The search should consider the time threshold condition.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Run tests for different times of day and verify that the correct dates are calculated, including scenarios just before and just after the midpoint of the day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately determines the date one year ago from a given date and time, accounting for time-based transitions and special cases. This will involve manipulating date and time representations and leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to apply the right logic based on the time of day.",

This involves a simple decrement of the day count within the same month and year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a straightforward application of date arithmetic, subtracting a certain number of days from the given date. There are no month or year transitions to worry about, as the third month (March) always starts from the 1st day and has 31 days. The main focus is on decrementing the day count accurately. In Prolog, this can be managed with a simple rule that subtracts days from the given date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a basic structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates, where DD represents the day of the month, MM the month, and YYYY the four-digit year.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a specified number of days (e.g., 10) from the given date. This rule should handle the decrement of the day count within the same month and year.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Include logic to handle cases where subtracting days would result in a day count of less than 1. In such cases, the day should be set to the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not required for this specific problem, prepare general rules for handling transitions across months and years when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Although leap years do not affect the date calculation in this scenario, include a general rule to check for leap years to handle February during leap years when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule that applies the day subtraction rule repeatedly until the desired number of days is subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day subtraction and handle any potential overflow situations.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the date subtraction rule with various scenarios, including cases that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure the logic is correct.\n   - Verify that the program handles dates within the same month accurately, such as subtracting 10 days from March 2nd, 1966.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date a certain number of days ago from a given date, focusing on accurate day subtraction within the same month and handling any potential edge cases.",

The focus is on accurately adding time without crossing any month or year boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for time addition that consider the number of days in the current month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent both date and time.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle time arithmetic operations accurately.\n\n2. **Increment Time Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the time by 24 hours. This will involve increasing the hours, minutes, and seconds accordingly, while keeping the date components unchanged.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day reaches the end of the current month after adding 24 hours. This rule should check the number of days in the current month and adjust the day and month accordingly.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule for a year transition in case the time increment causes a crossover to the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly needed for this specific problem, include a general rule to check for leap years to handle any potential leap year questions related to time increments.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle time increments, ensuring that the correct date is maintained even after multiple time additions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for time increments and date transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as time increments within the same day, transitions to the next day, and transitions across months and years.\n   - Verify that the program handles time arithmetic accurately, especially around month and year boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date and time 24 hours later from a given date and time, accounting for potential transitions across days, months, and years, and ensuring the integrity of the time components.",

This is important for ensuring the correctness of date transitions, especially in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although a simple increment is required, use recursive rules to handle the 24-hour transition, allowing for potential future expansion.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's rule application and search capabilities will help find the correct path to apply the day increment rule.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different dates, especially those near month boundaries, to ensure the correctness of the day increment operation.\n   - Verify that the program handles leap years correctly when adding one day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date 24 hours later from the current date, accounting for day overflows and leap years. This straightforward task can be achieved with simple date manipulation in Prolog.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one month ago from today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. Considering that December has only 31 days, we cannot simply subtract one month from the current date. Instead, we need to go back one month and adjust the day accordingly, as the number of days in the previous month is different from December.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding the number of days in each month and handling the transition between months appropriately. When moving back one month, we must account for the varying days in different months and potentially adjust the day of the month accordingly. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and leverage pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations for both incrementing and decrementing months and days.\n\n2. **Handling Month Decrement:**\n   - Write a rule that checks the current month and decrements it by one. If the current month is December, the previous month will be November.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the adjustment of the day when moving back one month. For example, if the current date is December 31, the date one month ago would likely have a day component of something other than 31.\n\n4. **Month-End and Year-End Transitions:**\n   - Handle transitions between months and years when adjusting the date. For instance, if the current date is January 1, the date one month ago would be in the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Account for leap years to handle February dates correctly. Leap years have 29 days in February, which changes the adjustment logic for that month.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's recursive capabilities to develop a rule that calculates the date one month ago by repeatedly applying the decrement rules until reaching the target date.\n   - Use Prolog's search features to match the current date and apply the appropriate rules for transition.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between different months and years, and the adjustment of days accordingly. Test cases might include moving from December 31 to November 30 and from February 29 to January 29 in a leap year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date from one month ago.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, given that today is January 1, 1930, following on from yesterday being December 31, 1929. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current year, which will result in the year 1929. Therefore, the date one year ago from today is December 31, 1929, represented as 12/31/1929 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple year subtraction from the current date while handling the transition between years. We need to decrement the year by one and ensure that the month and day remain unchanged. Prolog provides an ideal framework for defining such date arithmetic rules and applying them based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use the structure `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, ensuring it can handle year subtractions while preserving the month and day.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that subtracts one year from the current year. This rule should keep the month and day unchanged.\n\n3. **Application of Year Subtraction:**\n   - Use Prolog's rule application and search capabilities to apply the year subtraction rule when moving one year back from the current date.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Years:**\n   - Although the prompt specifies one year, anticipate and accommodate the potential for subtracting multiple years by making the subtraction rule recursive.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the program can handle leap years correctly. This may involve a check to confirm that the resulting year is a leap year if the current year is one.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the program's ability to subtract one or more years accurately, accounting for different starting dates, months, and days.\n   - Test both normal years and leap years to confirm the correctness of the leap year handling.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in creating a Prolog program that can determine the date one year ago from a given date.

This requires considering the end of the month boundary and adjusting the month and year accordingly. In this case, we will transition from December to the same year's December.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to find the date 24 hours after today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. As December only has 31 days, today is indeed January 1, 1930, due to the month-end transition. The date 24 hours later will still be within the same day, as 24 hours is not enough time to progress into the next day. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is January 1, 1930, which can be represented as 01/01/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a single-day transition within a month, which does not cross into another month or year. It belongs to the simpler end of the spectrum for date calculations. We need to increment the current date by 24 hours, which can be achieved by adding a single day. The main consideration is the month-end transition at December's end. In Prolog, we can define a rule to handle this transition smoothly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use the `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure to represent dates.\n   - Ensure it can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. This rule should be applied when the day is 31 in December.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day by 1 for all other dates.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly apply the day increment rule until the desired number of days (24 hours) has been added.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not relevant for this specific problem, include a leap year check to handle February dates in other contexts.\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a prompt that allows users to input a date and receives the output date, focusing on clear instructions and error handling.\n\nGiven the simplicity of this problem, there is no need for extensive recursive logic or complex pattern matching. The main consideration is the month-end transition, which can be easily handled with a single rule. The SWI-Prolog code prompt will guide the user to create a program for this specific date calculation, providing a straightforward solution.",

To find today's date, we need to add two days to the given date. This involves handling the transition from one day to the next and ensuring the correct date is calculated.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires incrementing the date by two days while accounting for day and potentially month transitions. We need a mechanism to handle the varying days in different months and adjust the month and year accordingly. In Prolog, we can utilize rules and recursion to manage these transitions and find the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function, `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)`, which adds one day to a given date. The function should handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month, as well as the transition from December 31 to January 1.\n\n3. **Recursive Date Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive function, `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)`, that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should call `increment_day` repeatedly until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. This will ensure accurate date calculations involving February.\n\n5. **Using Prolog's Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and recursion to find the solution by applying the appropriate rules based on the current date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, transitioning to the next month, and handling leap years.\n\n7. **Application to Query:**\n   - For the given problem, use the `add_days` function to calculate today's date by adding two days to the known date, which is two days ago.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to determine the correct date today based on the input of the day before yesterday.

To find yesterday's date, we need to subtract one more day from this date.

We need to handle the scenario where the day before yesterday is indeed the day before the month's end. In this case, we should decrement the day and keep the month intact. Prolog's capabilities can be used to define rules and handle this transition effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, allowing for easy arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day from a given date. This rule should consider the end of the month and only decrement the day if it's not the last day. For example, if `DD` is 24, the previous day should be 23, keeping the month as November.\n\n3. **Month and Year Stability:**\n   - Ensure that the month and year remain stable when subtracting a day, except when crossing into the previous month.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a recursive function that can subtract multiple days from a date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that the day before yesterday was November 23, 1933. From this information, we can deduce that yesterday was November 24, 1933, and therefore, today is November 25, 1933. As a result, the date tomorrow will be November 26, 1933.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date, specifically the date two days ago. It requires understanding day increments and handling the transitions between days and months. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and determine tomorrow's date accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, allowing for easy arithmetic operations on days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to a given date. This function should handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month, and also handle the special case when DD is 31, indicating the end of the year.\n\n3. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Develop a function `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one day from a given date. This function should handle the transition from the first day of a month to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule or function to check if a year is a leap year, as this affects the number of days in February and, consequently, other months.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Write a recursive function that starts from the date two days ago and applies the `increment_day` function twice to calculate tomorrow's date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to match the appropriate transition rules based on the current date and calculate the correct next date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between different months and the transition from December to January the following year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that determines the date tomorrow based on the day before yesterday's date, accounting for day and month transitions and leap years. This will involve both incrementing and decrementing dates using recursive logic and Prolog's search capabilities.",

To find this date, we need to subtract one month from November 23, 1933. This calculation involves understanding the boundaries of months and adjusting the date accordingly when crossing into the previous month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date based on a specified time interval (one month) from a given starting date. It involves handling transitions across months and potentially years. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules that manipulate dates, handling month and year transitions gracefully. The key is to understand how to subtract a month while accounting for the varying days in different months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation and Basic Operations:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates and perform basic arithmetic operations on them.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle month, day, and year adjustments when performing calculations.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. This rule should consider the number of days in the current month and adjust the day and month accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from November 23, 1933, should consider that November has 30 days and set the date to October 23, 1933.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between years when subtracting months. This occurs when the month to be subtracted is in the previous year.\n   - Adjust the year and month accordingly if the resulting date falls into the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial when subtracting months that span across February.\n\n5. **Recursive Month Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-month subtraction rule until the desired interval (one month) is achieved.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path when applying rules for month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, including those that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure the correct handling of transitions.\n   - Verify that the code can handle leap years and non-leap years, such as subtracting one month from February 28, 1932, and February 29, 1932.\n\n8. **User Input and Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date one month prior. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date one month ago from a given date, accounting for various month lengths, year transitions, and leap years.

We need a logic that can handle year subtractions, taking into account the transition between years and the corresponding changes in months and days. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for year decrementing and handling the cascading effects on months and days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a flexible date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for easy arithmetic operations, such as year subtractions.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This rule should consider the transition between years and adjust the year, month, and day accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the changes in months and days when subtracting a year. For example, if the given date is in a leap year, February will have 29 days, and the day should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's day count accurately during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog's recursive capabilities to develop a rule that applies the year subtraction logic recursively until one year has been subtracted.\n   - Leverage Prolog's search and pattern matching to ensure the correct rules are applied based on the date structure.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the year subtraction logic with various starting dates, including different months and days, and verify that the correct dates are obtained one year prior.\n   - Specifically, test with November 23, 1933, to confirm the logic handles the transition correctly.\n\n7. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date one year prior. Provide clear feedback on the result.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to calculate the date one year ago from a given date, accounting for year transitions, month changes, and day adjustments. This will deliver a practical solution for real-world date calculations using Prolog's features.",

In Prolog, we can manage this by defining rules for incrementing days, considering the number of days in each month, and handling any necessary year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that this structure can accommodate time increments in hours and handle day, month, and year transitions.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day by 1, considering the number of days in the current month. For example, November has 30 days, so November 23 + 1 day should be November 24.\n\n3. **Month Transition Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions to the next month when incrementing days. For instance, if the date is November 30, incrementing by one day should result in December 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to handle year transitions when incrementing days. This would apply if the current date is December 31; adding one day should change the year to the next.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial for correctly handling date transitions through February.\n\n6. **Time Increment in Hours:**\n   - Define a rule to increment the time in hours. Since 24 hours span over one day, this rule should work in conjunction with the day increment rules.\n\n7. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to find the date 24 hours later. Start from the given date and repeatedly apply the hour increment rule until reaching the desired time span.\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s search features to match and apply the correct rules based on the current date and time.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, including those that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure the correct behavior across different scenarios.\n   - Verify that the date transitions work accurately, especially around month ends and year ends, including leap years.\n\n9. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Design a user-friendly way for users to input a date, and ensure the program provides a clear and understandable output for the resulting date 24 hours later.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to calculate the correct date 24 hours after the input date, accounting for day, month, and year transitions, as well as time increments in hours. The recursive and search capabilities of Prolog will be instrumental in finding the correct date based on the complex transitions involved.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task involves determining the date 10 days ago from the US Thanksgiving in the year 2001. As Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, we can deduce that today's date is November 22, 2001. The objective is to calculate the date that was 10 days prior to November 22, 2001.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date that is a specific number of days before a given holiday date. We need to subtract 10 days from the current date while considering potential transitions across months and years. In this case, subtracting 10 days from November 22, 2001, will involve crossing into the previous month of November. Prolog can be used to define rules and handle these date calculations, including special cases.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a flexible date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations and handle different date transitions.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a certain number of days (e.g., 10 days) from a given date.\n   - Subtracting days should consider month boundaries, adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to manage transitions between months when subtracting days. For example, going from November 1st to October 31st.\n\n4. **Leap Year and February Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, as this affects the number of days in February.\n   - Handle February's special case, adjusting the end date accordingly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the day subtraction rule until the desired number of days is subtracted.\n\n6. **Special Case for First Days of the Month:**\n   - Handle transitions when the starting date is the first day of the month. For instance, November 01 should transition to October 31.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search and Recursion:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and recursive rules to find and apply the correct transitions based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, including those that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure accurate results.\n   - Verify that the code handles both leap and non-leap years correctly.\n\n9. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Create a user-friendly mechanism for inputting the desired date and providing the result to the user.\n\nFollowing this plan, the SWI-Prolog code will be able to calculate dates a specified number of days prior to a given date, accounting for different months, years, and even leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nUS Thanksgiving in 2001 fell on the fourth Thursday of November, and today happens to be that special Thursday. The task is to determine the date one week from today, which would land on the following Thursday of November 2001.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date based on a special condition\u2014US Thanksgiving\u2014and then adding one week to that date. We need to identify the fourth Thursday of November 2001 and then extend it by seven days. This requires understanding the number of days in a week and potentially handling transitions across different weeks and months. In Prolog, we can approach this by defining rules for identifying the fourth Thursday and then adding the appropriate number of days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. Ensure that this structure can handle weekly operations and month transitions.\n\n2. **Identify the Fourth Thursday:**\n   - Write a predicate `is_fourth_thursday(date(MM, DD, YYYY))` that checks if a given date is the fourth Thursday of November. This might involve checking the day of the week and ensuring that the date falls in November.\n\n3. **Add Weeks Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_weeks(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Weeks, NewDate)` that adds multiple weeks (7 days each) to a given date. This function should be recursive, allowing it to handle multiple week additions across month boundaries.\n\n4. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions to the next month when adding weeks. For instance, if the date is near the end of November, it should transition to December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in a year and thus the identification of the fourth Thursday of November.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and backtracking capabilities to find the fourth Thursday of November 2001. The program should explore different dates in November until it finds the one matching the condition.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `is_fourth_thursday` predicate with different dates in November, including both leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify the `add_weeks` function by adding various numbers of weeks across different months and years.\n\n8. **Putting It All Together:**\n   - Use the predicate to identify the fourth Thursday of November 2001 and then apply the week addition function to find the date one week from that day.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that identifies US Thanksgiving in a given year and calculates the date one week later.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after US Thanksgiving in the year 2001. As today is the fourth Thursday of November, which is the US Thanksgiving tradition, we can deduce that today is the Thursday falling in the fourth week of November 2001. We need to calculate the date 24 hours from now, considering potential transitions into December.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the date that is 24 hours after US Thanksgiving. This requires us to first determine the correct date of Thanksgiving in the given year and then add 24 hours to that date. The logic will need to handle week and month transitions and apply time increments correctly. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling the special case of Thanksgiving.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. This structure should allow us to perform arithmetic operations and handle different cases of date transitions.\n\n2. **Determine Thanksgiving Date:**\n   - Write a function `thanksgiving(Year, Date)` that calculates the date of Thanksgiving based on the given year. This function should consider the fourth Thursday of November.\n\n3. **Increment Time:**\n   - Develop a function `increment_time(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Hours, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of hours to a given date. This function should handle the transition of days, months, and potentially years when adding hours.\n\n4. **Handling Week and Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `increment_time` to handle the transition from one week to another, especially when crossing the month boundary. For example, if Thanksgiving is on November 28, adding 24 hours should lead to November 29.\n\n5. **Leap Year and Day Count:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, as this can affect the number of days in a year and thus the correct date of Thanksgiving.\n   - Handle potential special cases, such as November having 5 Thursdays in some situations.\n\n6. **Recursive Hour Addition:**\n   - Use recursion in the `increment_time` function to add hours one by one until reaching the specified number of hours (24 hours in this case).\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and backtracking mechanisms to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules based on the input date and desired hour increment.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `thanksgiving` function for different years to ensure it calculates the correct Thanksgiving dates.\n   - Verify the functionality of the `increment_time` function by adding various numbers of hours across different dates, including transitions between days and months.\n\n9. **Application to US Thanksgiving:**\n   - Given the date of US Thanksgiving in 2001, use the `increment_time` function to calculate the date 24 hours later.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that determines the correct date after adding 24 hours to US Thanksgiving in 2001.

This involves understanding and handling the transitions between dates, including the potential crossing of month and year boundaries.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of how days are subtracted from a given date while accounting for different months' lengths and year transitions. We need to define rules that handle these scenarios and recursively apply them to find the date 10 days ago. Prolog's strength lies in managing complex rules and recursive logic, making it suitable for implementing such date calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the program. This structure enables easy manipulation and recursive operations.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Start by defining a rule that subtracts one day from a given date. This rule should handle cases where the day being subtracted is the first day of the month, causing a month rollback. Also, handle the scenario where the first day of the month causes a year rollback.\n\n3. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive predicate that accepts a date and a number of days to subtract.

This is crucial for accurately handling February when subtracting months across years.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that subtracts one month repeatedly until it reaches the specified number of months (in this case, one month).\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month and year transitions based on the given date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create comprehensive test cases that cover various scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and across leap years. For instance, verify that subtracting one month from August 31, 1924, yields July 31, 1924.\n\n8. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Guide the user on how to input a date and provide a clear indication of the expected format. Offer feedback if the input is incorrect or incomplete.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that excels at computing dates from a past interval, considering all the intricacies of month and year transitions, and the impact of leap years. This real-world scenario will result in a practical and insightful date manipulation tool.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the rescheduled meeting time of 11 AM tomorrow. Since the meeting is rescheduled for tomorrow, which is October 16, 1924, the date 24 hours later will be October 17, 1924.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the given future date. We need to ensure that the time aspect (11 AM) is ignored, focusing solely on the date part of the rescheduling. The analysis indicates a simple increment of one day with no special conditions or transitions. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by adding a day to the given date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, considering only the date aspect.\n\n2. **Increment Date by One Day:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the current date by one day. If the day reaches 31 and is not the last day of the month, then it should reset to the first day of the next month.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement a general rule to handle transitions to the next month and year when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. This is not necessary for the given date but should be considered for general applicability.\n\n5. **Adding 24 Hours:**\n   - Write a function or predicate that adds 24 hours to a given date, using the increment date rule recursively.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to match the appropriate rules for incrementing the date and handling transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the code with various dates, including end-of-month scenarios, to ensure the correct operation of the increment rule.\n   - Verify that the addition of 24 hours works as expected, especially when crossing into the next day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that focuses on manipulating dates by ignoring time components.

We need to determine this date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves identifying the date that corresponds to the last day of a specific month and year. It requires understanding the number of days in each month to determine the correct day and ensuring the correct year, month, and day components are assembled in the output. In Prolog, we can construct rules based on the number of days in each month to deduce the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure this structure can be used to determine the last day of a month.\n\n2. **Days in Each Month:**\n   - Define a list of days in each month, such as `days_in_month([1, 31, 28, 31, ...])`, where each element corresponds to the days in January, February, March, and so on.\n\n3. **Determine Last Day:**\n   - Write a rule that uses the above list to determine the last day of a specific month and year.

Therefore, the date tomorrow will be February 1, 2012.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward transition from one day to the next within the same month and year. However, it's important to handle the change from the last day of the month to the first day of the following month. In this case, we need to transition from January 31 to February 1. Prolog can assist in this calculation by providing rules for date transitions, especially across month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that this structure can handle transitions between days within a month.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 when it is not the last day of the month. For instance, if `MM` is 1 (January) and `DD` is 30, the next date should be January 31, 2012.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Define a special rule to handle the last day of the month. This rule should set the day to 1 while keeping the same month and year. For example, January 31, 2012, becomes February 1, 2012.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific date transition, include a rule to check for leap years to handle February's day count during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to cover the transition from one day to the next, accounting for the month-end transition scenario described above.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to match the appropriate transition rule based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with scenarios that cover normal day increments and month-end transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, which means that today's date is January 31, 2012. To find the date for yesterday, we need to go back one day from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward decrement of the day within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the decrement does not go below the first day of the month, which is not an issue for January since it starts with 1. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that decrements the day and checks for the beginning of the month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be able to handle day decrements within the same month.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, decrementing January 31, 2012, should result in January 30, 2012.\n\n3. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Include rules to handle special cases, such as when the day is the first of the month or the first day of the year, to ensure the correct date is returned.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. However, this is not relevant for January dates.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to decrement the day repeatedly until reaching the first day of the month.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the decrement rule repeatedly until the desired date is reached.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the decrement rule for various days within the same month, ensuring it works correctly for the first and last days of the month.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that determines the date of yesterday based on the given last day of January 2012, showcasing the basic principles of date manipulation in Prolog.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, which means the current date is January 31, 2012. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to calculate the date for January 21, 2012.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining a date that is a certain number of days prior to the current date. We must subtract 10 days from the given date, accounting for the month and year boundaries. In this case, we are subtracting days from the last day of January, so we need to handle the transition back to the same month. Prolog can assist in this calculation by providing rules for date arithmetic and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Represent Dates:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent calendar dates. This structure should allow for arithmetic operations to subtract days.\n\n2. **Subtract Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a certain number of days from a given date. If the resulting date falls within the same month, keep the same month value.\n   - For example, subtracting 10 days from January 31, 2012, should result in January 21, 2012.\n\n3. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle transitions when the starting date is the last day of the month. In this case, we need to reset the day to the first of the same month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Awareness:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, as this can affect the number of days in February and thus potentially impact the calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly subtract days until the target number of days is reached. This approach will handle various cases, including transitions across months and potential leap years.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Matching:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply the appropriate rules based on the current date and the desired number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Test the program with various starting dates, including the last days of months, to ensure it handles month transitions correctly. Also, test it with different numbers of days to subtract, including scenarios where the past date spans across months or into different years.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate dates that are a certain number of days in the past, accounting for month boundaries and leap years, making it a versatile tool for date-related computations.",

For January, set the year to the previous year regardless of the day.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if the current year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and thus the validity check in the previous step.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Apply the year subtraction rule in a recursive manner until the year becomes valid.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to find and apply the correct rules for year subtraction and date validation.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the year subtraction rule with various starting dates, including those in January, February (leap year and non-leap year), and other months, to ensure the logic handles all cases correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one year ago from a given date, accounting for different months and leap years. This will involve implementing rules for year subtraction and handling special cases where the resulting date would be invalid.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, which means today's date is January 31, 2012. To find the date one week ago, we need to calculate the date seven days prior to January 31, 2012.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward backward calculation of seven days from the given date. However, we must ensure that the calculation handles the transition across different weeks, including the possibility of crossing over into the previous month. In this case, January only has 31 days, so the week before would be within the same month. In Prolog, we can implement a rule to subtract a certain number of days from a given date, handling month boundaries when necessary.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations to subtract days.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that decrements the given date by `Days` days. If the day reaches 0 or a negative value, it should reset to the last day of the month and decrement the month accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Week Transition:**\n   - Write a specific rule to handle the transition to the previous week, which involves subtracting 7 days. This rule should ensure that the correct date one week ago is calculated.\n\n4. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions across month and year boundaries. For example, if the starting date is January 7, 2012, the date one week ago would be December 31, 2011.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which affects the days in February and thus could impact the date calculation.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find and apply the correct rules for date transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_days` function and the week transition rule with various scenarios, including transitions within the same month, between months, and between years.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to determine the date after a simple day increment within the same month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a basic increment of the day and does not require any special handling for month or year transitions. The focus is on ensuring a correct day increment within the confines of the same month.

This function should handle the day increment within the same month.\n\n3. **Basic Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. For instance, if the input date is `date(1, 31, 2012)`, the output should be `date(1, 1, 2012)`.\n\n4. **Month-End Handling:**\n   - Although not required for this specific scenario, include a general rule to handle cases where the day reaches the end of the month. This rule would reset the day to the first of the following month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Even though it's not relevant here, include a brief explanation of how leap years would be handled to accommodate February having 29 days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's pattern matching will help match the appropriate rules based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `increment_day` function with various dates, including the last day of each month and different years, to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a simple Prolog program to find the date 24 hours later from a given date, focusing on accurate day increments within the same month. This basic functionality can be the foundation for more complex date calculations in various applications.",

There are no special transitions like month or year changes. The focus is on accurately adding a specific number of days to a given date. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining a rule that increments the days and applying it recursively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Implement a function `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of `Days` to a given date. This function should handle the basic increment of days, resetting the day if it goes beyond the month's length.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was one month ago from the current date, given that a week ago it was September 1, 2021. To find this date, we need to calculate the date one month prior to September 1, 2021. This involves understanding and handling the transition between months and potentially adjusting the day accordingly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a specific date relative to the current date, focusing on month transitions. The key consideration is determining the date of the first day of the previous month and ensuring the correct day is selected for that month. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle these month transitions and leverage pattern matching to apply the correct logic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy manipulation of months and days.\n\n2. **Base Case for Month Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the transition from September 1 to August 1. This rule should set the month to August (`MM` becomes 8) and adjust the day accordingly based on the number of days in August.\n\n3. **Handling Other Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions to other months, ensuring that the correct day is selected for each month. For example, if the input date is June 30, the previous month's date should be May 31.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. Adjust the day and month accordingly when transitioning from February to January.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although the prompt specifies a month ago, implementing recursive rules for multiple month transitions could be useful for future extensions. These rules would repeatedly apply the single-month transition rule.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the current month and apply the appropriate transition rule.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various month transitions, such as June to May, February to January in both leap and non-leap years, and September to August in the provided scenario.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles different starting days within a month, such as September 5 transitioning to August 5.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in creating a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one month ago from a given date.

In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules that manage year decrements while considering the current month and day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use the `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure to represent dates, which allows for easy arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that a week ago it was September 1, 2021. Today's date is September 8, 2021, and we need to find the date seven days from now.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on the current date by adding seven days. We need to handle the transition between days and potentially weeks, ensuring that the correct date is determined even when crossing week boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for date increments and using recursive logic to handle multiple day additions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle day increments and roll over to the next week if necessary.\n\n3. **Week Boundary Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one week to the next. For example, if the current date is Friday, adding seven days should result in the following Friday.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and potentially affects subsequent months.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Week Addition:**\n   - Use recursion to implement the `increment_date` function. For instance, adding seven days should recursively call the function with seven days subtracted from the input date until reaching a base case (e.g., DD == 1).\n\n6. **Base Case and Week Handling:**\n   - Define a base case when the target date has been reached. If the day is Thursday (DD == 4), the week has been completed, and the function should return the following Thursday.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to manage the recursive addition of days and weeks.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different starting dates and verify the correct outcome one week later, especially around month and week boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week from a given date. This will involve implementing rules for date increments, considering week boundaries, and leveraging Prolog's recursive capabilities and search functions.",

Given that it was September 1st, 2021 a week ago, we need to calculate the date and time 24 hours after that.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their marriage on January 2, 1958, and today marks their 5-year anniversary. The task is to determine the correct date for this special occasion. Since it has been five years since their wedding, we need to add five years to the original wedding date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple addition of a known number of years to a given date. However, we must account for the fact that different months have different numbers of days and potentially handle transitions across years. In this case, adding five years to January 2, 1958, will result in January of the following year, 1963. We also need to determine the exact day of the month for the anniversary date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for basic arithmetic operations to add years to a date.\n\n2. **Add Years to a Date:**\n   - Write a rule that adds a specified number of years (e.g., 5) to a given date. This rule should handle the transition from one year to another, setting the month and day accordingly for the new year.\n\n3. **Handling Month Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the correct alignment of days within the months. For example, if the original date is January 2 and we add 5 years, the anniversary date should be also on the 2nd day of the month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their marriage on January 2, 1958, and today marks their 5-year anniversary. The task is to determine the date for tomorrow. As today is the fifth anniversary of the wedding date, adding one more year would make it the sixth anniversary. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be January 2, 1964, which can be represented as 01/02/1964 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a memorable past date. We need to add five years to the wedding date and then increment by one more day to find the date for tomorrow. This requires understanding basic arithmetic operations on dates and handling the transition between years. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these calculations and transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Addition of Years:**\n   - Write a rule that adds a certain number of years (in this case, 5) to a given date. This rule should increment the year accordingly.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day by one, handling the transition from one day to the next within the same month.\n\n4. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Ensure that the rules correctly handle the scenario where the incremented date falls on the next year (e.g., adding one day to December 31).\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, as this can affect the number of days in a year and, consequently, the date calculations.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although a straightforward calculation is involved, use recursive rules to add years and increment days, making the code more generic.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Let Prolog\u2019s rule application and pattern matching determine whether to increment the day or transition to the next year based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the addition of years for various starting dates, including dates that span across leap years, to verify the correctness of the leap year handling.\n   - Ensure that the program handles dates around December 31st correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can calculate tomorrow's date from Jane and John's wedding date, accounting for the passage of five years and the subsequent day increment.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their marriage on January 2, 1958, and today marks their 5-year anniversary. The task is to determine the date 10 days ago from this special day. To find this date, we need to subtract 10 days from the current anniversary date, considering the year, month, and day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date based on a given number of days before a known date. The key considerations are handling transitions across months and years while subtracting days. In this scenario, subtracting 10 days from the anniversary date would likely span across January's end and potentially the beginning of a new year. Prolog's capabilities can be leveraged to define rules for date arithmetic, including decrements and transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Represent Date:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for day, month, and year manipulations.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. This rule should account for the end of the month by resetting the day to the last day of the previous month when necessary.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from January 1 would return December 31 of the same year.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their marriage on January 2, 1958, and today marks their 5-year anniversary. The task is to determine the date one month ago from this special day. To find this date, we need to calculate the date that was one month prior to today's anniversary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding how to subtract a certain duration (one month) from a given date. We must handle the transition between months and potentially between years if the date goes back into a previous year. In this scenario, subtracting one month from the anniversary date of January 2, 1958, would likely fall into the previous year, 1957. Prolog's capabilities can be leveraged to define rules for month subtraction and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for easy manipulation and transitions between dates.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. This rule should account for the varying days in different months and adjust the month and day accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from January 2 should result in December 2, 1957.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between years when subtracting months. This will require decrementing the year when the end of December is reached.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial for accurate month subtraction spanning February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-month subtraction rule until the desired month subtraction is achieved.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the correct path when applying rules for month and year transitions.\n   - Pattern matching can help identify the appropriate rules to apply based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, including scenarios that cross month and year boundaries, and verify that the correct dates are calculated.\n   - Ensure that the program handles both leap and non-leap years accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month ago from a given date, accounting for both month and year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their marriage on January 2, 1958, and today is their 5-year anniversary. Therefore, the current date is January 2, 1963. The task is to determine the date 24 hours later, which would be January 3, 1963.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the current date, which falls within the same month and year. The key is to recognize that a normal day incrementation should be applied, accounting for the standard number of hours in a day. In Prolog, we can implement a rule to handle this regular date transition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, enabling operations like day addition.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to the input date. This function should account for the regular day-to-day transition, increasing the day number by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Standard Day Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule that covers the vast majority of day increments: If the current day is not the last day of the month, simply increment the day number.\n\n4. **Month and Year End Transitions:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific scenario, include general rules for handling transitions to the next month or year when the current month or year ends.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Account for leap years to handle the special case of February having 29 days instead of the usual 28.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop recursive rules to handle the addition of a single day repeatedly, until the desired number of days (24 hours) is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and rule application to ensure the correct and most appropriate date transition is selected, given the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functionality of the `increment_day` function for various dates, including end-of-month and end-of-year transitions, as well as leap year cases.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that adds 24 hours to a given date, demonstrating a basic but practical application of date manipulation in Prolog, especially focusing on day increments.",

To find the date of yesterday, we need to calculate 39 days from May 9, 2017, considering the weekly transition from Sunday to Monday.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting a certain number of days (39 days) from a known date (May 9, 2017). We need to handle the weekly transition during the calculation, as the days of the week affect Jane's egg consumption. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle the day and month transitions and use recursive logic for day subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day decrements and account for weekly transitions.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write rules to subtract one day from a given date, considering the weekly transition. For instance, if `DD` is 6 (Sunday), then the next day should be 7 (Monday), and the week number should reset if the month remains the same.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days.

In Prolog, we can achieve this by implementing rules for date arithmetic and handling the month transitions accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow us to perform month arithmetic and transitions.\n\n2. **Subtract One Month Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_one_month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the date one month prior to the given date. This function should handle the transition of days within the same month and roll over to the previous month or year if needed.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting one month. For example, if the given date is in February, the previous month would be January of the same or next year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, as this affects the number of days in February and thus the calculation of the previous month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop recursive rules to subtract one month repeatedly until the target date is reached.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane ran out of eggs today after buying 40 eggs on May 9, 2017 and eating one per day. If she started with 40 eggs on May 9, 2017 and ate one egg every day, then today would be May 8, 2018, one year later.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date exactly one year prior to the present date, considering a daily egg consumption of one egg. The key is to determine today's date by understanding the pattern of egg consumption and then subtracting one year from that date. This requires handling the transition between years and ensuring the accuracy of the calculation. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date arithmetic and leverage Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct today's date before subtracting a year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Determine Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule that calculates today's date based on the egg consumption pattern. Start from May 9, 2017, and increment the days until the eggs run out, which will be May 8, 2018.\n\n3. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This will likely involve changing the year by decrementing it by one while keeping the month and day intact.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the month and day remain within their respective ranges when subtracting years. For example, if the current month is January, subtracting one year should result in January of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Account for leap years to handle the day count accurately. Leap years have 366 days, so the egg consumption pattern would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules in conjunction with Prolog's search capabilities to find today's date based on the egg consumption pattern. Apply rules for date arithmetic to subtract one year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the calculation of today's date using the egg consumption pattern and verify that subtracting one year produces the correct date across different years, including leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that determines the date one year ago from today, considering a unique egg consumption pattern and various calendar considerations such as leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane ran out of eggs today, after eating one egg per day since May 9, 2017. We need to determine the date 24 hours after today, considering this egg-eating scenario. Since Jane ate one egg a day, today's date would be May 18, 2017, and the date 24 hours later would be May 19, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date based on a daily activity (eating eggs) that spans multiple days. We need to determine the number of days between two given dates and then add 24 hours to the latter date. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date calculations and arithmetic operations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Calculate Days Between Dates:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the number of days between two dates. This can be done by subtracting the second date from the first date.\n   - Subtracting dates should consider the difference in days between the end and start dates, accounting for months and years.\n\n3. **Increment Date by Days:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment a given date by a certain number of days. This rule should handle the transitions between months and years if needed.\n\n4. **Add 24 Hours:**\n   - After determining the date today (May 18, 2017), add 24 hours to it to find the date and time 24 hours later.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to ensure accurate date calculations, especially when dealing with February.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and search to find the intermediate dates between May 9 and the current date, and then add 24 hours to the final date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the date calculation with different starting and ending dates, including scenarios that span multiple months and years.\n   - Verify that the code handles the addition of hours correctly, especially at the end of days, months, and years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that simulates the scenario of Jane and her eggs.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of yesterday, knowing that today is the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter ends on March 31, which means that yesterday was March 30, 2008. The date can be represented as 03/30/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves identifying the date that precedes the last day of the first quarter of a given year. It requires understanding that the first quarter ends on March 31. The solution will need to decrement the day by one while keeping the month and year intact. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules that handle this specific date transition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n\n2. **Identify Last Day of First Quarter:**\n   - Write a rule that identifies the last day of the first quarter of a given year. This rule should fix the month to 3 (March) and set the day to 31.\n\n3. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to decrement the day by one. For example, going from March 31, 2008, to March 30, 2008.\n\n4. **Handling Non-Boundary Cases:**\n   - Write rules to handle the decrementing of days within the same month, ensuring the day doesn't go below 1.\n\n5. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Include rules to handle transitions across months and years when decrementing days. For instance, if the date is January 1, decrement to December 31 of the previous year.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to handle February dates correctly.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to apply the decrementing rule repeatedly until reaching the desired previous date.\n\n8. **Prolog Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to find the appropriate rules and transition to the previous date correctly.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with dates spanning different quarters and years, including leap years, to ensure the correct behavior across various scenarios.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that determines the date of yesterday, given today is the last day of the first quarter.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter ends on March 31, 2008. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from March 31, 2008.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date that is a specific number of days before the given date, which happens to be the end of a quarter. This involves decrementing days while handling month and potentially year transitions. In this case, subtracting 10 days from March 31, 2008, would take us back to the previous month, March. We need to carefully manage this transition and determine the correct date. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle such scenarios, including checking for the number of days in each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for flexible changes in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. The rule should account for the first day of the month, adjusting the date accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from March 31, 2008, should result in March 30, 2008.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to manage the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This rule should consider the number of days in each month and update the month and day values correctly.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule. This will enable us to subtract any desired number of days.\n   - Apply this recursion to find the date 10 days ago from the input date.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February's varying number of days. This is crucial for accurate date calculations.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules for date transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including scenarios that involve crossing month boundaries and leap years.\n   - Verify that the program can handle different numbers of days to be subtracted, such as 1 day, 5 days, and 10 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that calculates a date a certain number of days prior to a given date, accounting for month and year transitions and leap years.

Therefore, the date one year prior would be March 31, 2007.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one year prior to a given date, which requires understanding year transitions and potentially crossing over to the previous year. In this case, we need to go back one year from the last day of March 2008. This can be achieved by decrementing the year by 1 while maintaining the month and day.

These rules should handle the general case of moving back by one year, considering potential month and day adjustments.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the current date and apply the correct rules to determine the date one year ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the code with various dates, including those around the transitions between quarters and across different years, to ensure the accuracy of the year decrement.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles both leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date one year ago from a given date, accounting for year transitions and potential special cases.

The key considerations are understanding the weekdays for both the first day of the year and today, and then inferring the weekday for tomorrow. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that relate to the number of days since the beginning of the year and the corresponding weekdays.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Weekday Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates, and another structure like `weekday(DayOfWeek)` to represent the day of the week (e.g., Tuesday, Monday).\n   - Ensure that the date structure can handle basic day increments.\n\n2. **Initialize Weekday Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to initialize the weekday calculation, considering the first day of 2019 as a reference Tuesday.\n\n3. **Increment Weekdays:**\n   - Define a rule to increment the weekday structure based on the days passed since the beginning of the year. For example, if today is the first Monday (5 days after Tuesday), then tomorrow will be a Tuesday.\n\n4. **Update Date Structure:**\n   - Write a rule to update the date structure based on the incremented weekday. As we are only moving one day forward, this will likely involve incrementing the day (DD) by 1.\n\n5. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle any potential month and year transitions that might occur when incrementing the date. This is unlikely in this specific scenario but should be considered generally.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to handle any adjustments needed for February's dates. However, this is not a concern in this case as we are dealing with the early days of January.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct weekday and date transitions based on the input conditions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct calculation of weekdays and dates, especially around month and year transitions.\n   - Test the code with different starting weekdays for the first day of the year to ensure the logic is robust.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that determines tomorrow's date based on the unique conditions provided, requiring logical reasoning about weekdays and date transitions.",

We need to calculate the previous day from today, which is the first Sunday of 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding the days of the week and calculating the previous day within the same month and year. The key is to recognize that the first Monday of the year implies the preceding day was a Sunday. We also know that the year has started, so we don't need to handle year transitions. In Prolog, we can implement rules based on the days of the week to find the previous day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates, focusing on the day and year components for this problem.\n\n2. **Define Days of the Week:**\n   - Establish a mapping or enumeration of the days of the week, where Tuesday is the first day.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from today, considering that today is the first Monday of 2019. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date while accounting for the day of the week transition from Monday to Tuesday, as the first day of 2019 was a Tuesday.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves both day subtraction and understanding the days of the week. We need to subtract the days while considering the potential transition across different days of the week, especially from Monday to Tuesday, which was the case on the first day of 2019. In Prolog, we can leverage rules and pattern matching to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Day Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates and another structure like `day_of_week(Day)` to represent the day of the week, where `Day` could be a atom representing the days of the week (e.g., `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.).\n   - Ensure these structures can handle arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a certain number of days (in this case, 10 days) from the current date. This rule should handle the transition between days of the week, especially from Monday to Tuesday, which aligns with the first day of 2019 being a Tuesday.\n\n3. **Weekday Transition Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the specific transition from Tuesday to Monday, as mentioned in the problem statement. This might involve checking the day of the week of the input date and adjusting the date accordingly.\n\n4. **Month and Year Considerations:**\n   - Include rules to handle potential transitions across months and years when subtracting days. This requires adjusting the month and year values when crossing these boundaries.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Write a rule to check for leap years, as this can affect the number of days in February and potentially impact the date calculation.\n\n6. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Use recursion to subtract the required number of days from the input date, applying the day subtraction and weekday transition rules as needed.\n\n7. **Prolog Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to match the appropriate rules based on the input date and the desired day subtraction.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including transitions between days of the week, months, and years. For example, test the transition from the first Monday of 2019 to the Tuesday of the last week of 2018.\n\n9. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that guides users to input the current date and receive the desired output, handling invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date 10 days ago, accounting for day-of-the-week transitions and other date boundaries, providing a practical solution to the problem using SWI-Prolog.",

For example, if the current date is December 30, the subsequent Monday will be in January of the same year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, as this can affect the number of days in February and, consequently, the week transitions.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find the subsequent Monday of the current week and then add seven days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, such as the transition between weeks within the same month and the transition from the last week of one month to the first week of the next month.\n   - Ensure that the program handles different starting days of the week gracefully.\n\n8. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Create a user-friendly input system where users can specify a date and the day of the week, receiving the date of the following Monday as output. Provide clear feedback for valid and invalid inputs.\n\nBy following this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date one week from today, accounting for week transitions, month boundaries, and even leap years. This will provide a practical solution for real-world date calculations using SWI-Prolog's capabilities.",

        "question": "The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the first Monday of the year 2019. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the date for the Tuesday that follows the first Monday of 2019. This involves understanding the number of days between these two days and handling the transition from Monday to Tuesday.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a straightforward calculation of the date 24 hours in the future, with the added context of it being the first Monday of the year. We need to handle the transition from Monday to Tuesday and ensure that the year and month remain unchanged. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining a rule that increments the day by one, considering the week boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates, focusing on the day of the week and the ability to increment days.\n\n2. **Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day by 1 while considering the start of the week (Monday). For example, if the input date is Monday, January 1, 2019, the output date should be Tuesday, January 2, 2019.\n\n3. **Week Boundary Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the rule resets the day to Monday when crossing the week boundary. This is crucial to handle the transition from the first Monday to the following Tuesday correctly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly needed for this specific problem, include a general rule to handle leap years, as it may be required for future date calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle consecutive day increments and utilize Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct solution based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct operation of the day increment rule, especially around week boundaries. Test cases should confirm that the date transitions are handled accurately.\n\n7. **User Input and Feedback:**\n   - Create a clear and user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receives the output date 24 hours later. Provide feedback to ensure users understand the program's functionality and requirements.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date 24 hours after the first Monday of 2019 while handling week transitions and ensuring the correctness of the output date.",
