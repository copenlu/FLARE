                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago, given that a concert originally scheduled for June 1, 1943, was delayed by one day, making today June 2, 1943. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

Given that today is March 12, 2002, the date 24 hours later would be March 13, 2002. This can be represented as 03/13/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day. This involves understanding the month-day boundaries and handling the transition from one day to the next. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 12, then the next date should be March 13, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 31, the next date should be April 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., March 12 to March 13), month-end transitions (e.g., March 31 to April 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to the US Thanksgiving in 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001. Therefore, one month before this date would be October 22, 2001, which can be represented as 10/22/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one month prior to a given date. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating dates based on the US Thanksgiving holiday and then performing a simple month subtraction, taking care to adjust the year if necessary (e.g., if the month is January). In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November. Use date manipulation functions to find the first day of November of the given year, then calculate the first Thursday, and finally add three weeks to get the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day (e.g., moving from March 31 to February), adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Thanksgiving and the month subtraction. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in matching the correct rules based on the input year and handling exceptions like leap years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months or calculating dates.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years to ensure the Thanksgiving date is calculated correctly and the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including end-of-year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before Thanksgiving for any given year, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively."

If it was September 1, 2021, a week ago, then today is September 8, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that the year 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future, which means it will be January 1, 2015, in 12 hours. Therefore, today is December 30, 2014. One week from today would be January 6, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the new year transition from December to January. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to December 30, 2014, should result in January 6, 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that today is December 31, 2020. Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date. Since December 31 is the last day of the year, subtracting seven days means we need to go back into the previous month, December, and find the date that corresponds to seven days before December 31.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting days. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering the transition between months. For example, if `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve recursive logic and careful consideration of month and year boundaries."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today, given that today is April 19, 1969. Since there are no special conditions like a month or year transition, the date 24 hours later would simply be April 20, 1969. This can be represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this specific case since April has 30 days. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions."

Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

This function should increment the day value (`DD`) by 1 while keeping the month and year values unchanged.\n\n3. **Handling Normal Days:**\n   - Implement the logic for normal days, where the day is not the last of the month, by simply incrementing the day.\n\n4. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific scenario, define a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the current day is the last day of the month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nBuilding on the information from the previous prompt, yesterday was April 30, 2021, which makes today May 1, 2021. The task now is to determine the date one week from today. This involves calculating seven days ahead from the current date, May 1, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo find the date one week from today, we need to perform a straightforward increment of seven days on the current date. Since this falls within the same month and year, the primary task is to add a fixed number of days while ensuring the day number remains within the boundaries of the month. In Prolog, this can be achieved using date manipulation functions and simple arithmetic operations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use the `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure to represent dates. This structure allows for easy manipulation of individual date components.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. The function should increment the day component by the specified `Days` value, handling the transition to the next month or year if necessary.\n\n3. **Handle Month Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to reset the day to the first day of the next month if it exceeds the maximum days in the current month. For example, adding seven days to May 1 would result in May 8, but since May has only 31 days, the function should return June 1, 2021.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the following year if the day exceeds December 31.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will help determine the number of days in February during the addition of days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `add_days` function to add days repeatedly until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Let Prolog's search and pattern matching determine the appropriate rules for month and year transitions during the addition of days.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, transitioning to the next month, and transitioning to the next year.

        "question": "Yesterday was April 30, 2021. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to determine the date that will be 24 hours after yesterday's date of April 30, 2021. To find this, we first need to establish today's date, which follows directly from yesterday being April 30, 2021: today is May 1, 2021. From here, we can conclude that 24 hours later will fall on May 2, 2021, beginning at midnight and running through the following day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the current date, which falls within the same month and year. The main focus is on ensuring the accuracy of the time transition without crossing any month or year boundaries. In Prolog, this can be managed by employing rules that account for such boundaries.\n\n**Plan for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation:**\n   - Implement a date structure, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, which represents dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Design the structure to accommodate additions of hours within the same month and year.\n\n2. **Add Hours Function:**\n   - Create a function, `add_hours(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Hours, NewDate)`, which is responsible for adding the specified hours to a given date.\n   - Ensure that the function handles the transition across days while staying within the same month and year.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Write a rule to address the scenario where adding hours causes the day to exceed the number of days in the current month. This rule should reset the day to the first of the following month when necessary.\n\n4. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Implement rules to handle situations where adding hours pushes the date into the next month or year. For instance, if the date is December 31, adding hours should transition the date to January 1 of the following year.\n\n5. **Leap Years:**\n   - Integrate a leap year check to accurately handle February, adjusting the end date accordingly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Addition:**\n   - Employ recursion within the `add_hours` function to iteratively add the desired number of hours, adjusting the date until the specified number of hours is reached.\n\n7. **Prolog Search and Matching:**\n   - Rely on Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply the appropriate rules based on the current date and the desired hour addition.\n\n8. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Craft test cases that validate the functionality of the `add_hours` function across diverse situations, including transitions at month ends, year ends, and leap years. For instance, confirm that adding 24 hours to May 1, 2021, yields May 2, 2021.\n\nThe code prompt, following this outline, will guide users in crafting a Prolog program to determine a future date based on a given date and hour addition. This will involve managing various date transitions and leveraging Prolog's strengths in handling such scenarios.\n\n### Final Answer: \n\n05/01/2021",

To find today's date, we need to subtract two days from June 1, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the current date by subtracting a small number of days from a known future date. We need to handle the transitions between days, potentially across month boundaries. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules for subtracting days and managing month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.

If the resulting day is less than 1, decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when subtracting days. For example, if the starting date is June 1, subtracting two days should consider the days in May.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's days accurately when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly until reaching the desired number of days subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the appropriate transitions and apply the correct rules for day and month adjustments.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correctness of the date subtraction across different months and years, including leap years.\n   - Ensure the program handles scenarios where the starting date is near month or year boundaries.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly query that allows users to input a future date and receive the current date in return.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was yesterday, given that the deadline of June 1, 2021, is two days away. To find yesterday's date, we need to subtract one day from the current date, which is two days ahead of June 1.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward decrement of two days from the known deadline date. There are no special considerations such as month or year transitions, but a general approach should account for such scenarios. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle the decrement of days and apply them accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations to subtract days.\n\n2. **Decrement Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `decrement_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date. This function should handle the general decrement of days and reset the day and month if necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions when decrementing days. For instance, if the date is June 1, decrementing one day should set the month to May and reset the day to the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February appropriately when decrementing days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Decrement:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day decrement rule repeatedly until reaching the desired number of days (in this case, two days) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct decrement rules based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as decrementing days within the same month, across month boundaries, and into the previous year.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the decrement of two days from June 1, 2021, resulting in the correct date of May 30, 2021.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date of two days ago from a given date, accounting for general date transitions and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was one month ago from the upcoming deadline of June 1, 2021. To find this date, we need to subtract one month from June 1, considering that it's a two-day difference from the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting one month from a given deadline. We must account for the two-day difference from the current date, which means we should subtract five days instead of the usual seven to go back one week. The main challenge is handling the month-end transitions and potentially adjusting the year when crossing into the previous year. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date arithmetic, considering these transitions and special cases.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, enabling arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Subtract One Month:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. This rule should handle the transition between months and adjust the day accordingly. If the month has fewer days than the starting day, the day should be set to the last day of that month.\n\n3. **Adjust for Week Difference:**\n   - Subtract five days instead of seven from the current date to account for the two-day difference from the actual deadline.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition into the previous year when subtracting one month. This would require decrementing the year when the starting month is January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's date range correctly when subtracting months.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find the date one month ago, considering the week difference and applying the correct rules based on the initial date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the program can handle different scenarios, such as transitions between months and years, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was one year ago from the deadline mentioned, which is June 1, 2021. To find this date, we need to subtract one year from the upcoming deadline. This results in the date June 1, 2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward subtraction of one year from a given date. However, we must ensure that the year is correctly adjusted, especially when dealing with different months and their varying numbers of days. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle this year subtraction, being cautious of the transitions between months and years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations, including year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that reduces the year by one.\n   - Handle cases where subtracting a year goes across month and year boundaries, adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n\n3. **Month and Day Adjustment:**\n   - When subtracting a year, if the starting month is January, then the month and day should remain the same. If not, the month should decrement and the day should be adjusted based on the number of days in the previous month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years. In a leap year, February has 29 days, which affects the previous month's day count.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion to develop a rule that subtracts one year repeatedly until reaching the target date.\n   - Use Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date and subtract the year accordingly.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as subtracting a year from various months and handling the transition from a leap year to a non-leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that performs accurate year subtraction from a given date, accounting for various month lengths and leap years.

To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from today's date. As a result, the date one week ago was May 23, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting seven days from the current date. We need to handle this transition within the same month and potentially adjust for the year if the date reaches the beginning of the month. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date arithmetic, handling boundaries and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtraction Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days (in this case, seven days) from a given date.\n\n3. **Handling Month Boundaries:**\n   - Include logic within the subtraction function to handle the transition across month boundaries. When subtracting days, if the resulting day is prior to the first day of the month, the month should be adjusted accordingly, and the year might need adjustment if the date reaches January 1.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a leap year check to the subtraction function to correctly handle February dates.

In Prolog, this can be achieved by employing date and time manipulation functions and handling the transitions between days and hours correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use structures like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` for dates and `time(HH, MM, SS)` for time representations.\n   - Ensure these structures can handle arithmetic operations for both date and time increments.\n\n2. **Calculate the Deadline:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the deadline date, June 1, 2021, based on the current date. Increment the current month and set the day and year accordingly.\n\n3. **Add Time and Day Function:**\n   - Develop a function that adds a specified number of hours to a given date. This function should handle the transition to the next day if the time exceeds 24 hours.\n\n4. **Handling Day and Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between days and months when adding hours. For example, if the time exceeds 24 hours and spills over to the next day, the day should be incremented, and the hours should reset to 0.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly when calculating the deadline date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to add the specified 24 hours to the deadline date, applying the hour addition function repeatedly until the desired time is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to manage the various date and time transitions, ensuring the correct rules are applied.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the functionality of the hour addition across different scenarios, including transitions between days and months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can handle complex date and time calculations, such as determining the date 24 hours after a deadline two days in the future.

This results in November 11, 2019, which can be represented as 11/11/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward decrement of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the decrement does not go beyond the first day of the month. In this case, we subtract one day from November 12, which falls within the same month. In Prolog, this can be handled with a simple rule that decrements the day while checking for the beginning of the month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for day decrements within a month.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 1. If the day becomes 0, set it to the last day of the month (e.g., November 30).\n\n3. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Implement rules to handle boundaries, such as the first day of the month and the transition to the previous year when subtracting days.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February. This is not needed for the current scenario but is crucial for general date manipulation.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that decrements the day repeatedly until it reaches 1, handling the transition to the previous month or year if necessary.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the input date and the desired decrement.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover simple day decrements within the same month and test cases that cross month boundaries, both forward and backward.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine yesterday's date based on the given information about tomorrow's date. This involves basic date manipulation and understanding of day, month, and year transitions.",

This will involve handling the transition between days and potentially between weeks, while staying within the same month and year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires subtracting a specific number of days (10) from the given date. We need to handle the day transitions and ensure the correct date is selected when crossing over into the previous week. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these date arithmetic operations, leveraging the language's pattern matching and search capabilities to apply the correct rules.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between weeks, adjusting the date accordingly.\n\n3. **Week Transition Handling:**\n   - Implement logic within the function to handle the transition across weeks.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from tomorrow, given that tomorrow is November 12, 2019. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from November 12, 2019. This will result in the date November 5, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a specific number of days prior to a given future date. We need to handle transitions between days and potentially across month boundaries. In this case, subtracting seven days from November 12 does not cross into the previous month, so the month and year remain unchanged. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle the day subtraction and verify the correctness of the resulting date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure supports arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a certain number of days (in this case, seven days) from a given date. If the resulting day is less than 1, decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement a condition in the day subtraction rule to handle cases where the subtraction crosses into the previous month. This might involve resetting the month and potentially the year if the month is January.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly. Subtracting days during a leap year should consider February's 29 days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that can handle subtracting any number of days from a given date. This rule should repeatedly subtract a single day until reaching zero days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day subtraction and month transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various scenarios, including dates that require crossing month boundaries and leap year scenarios, to ensure the program correctly handles different situations.\n   - Verify that the code can subtract various numbers of days accurately, such as 3 days or 10 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date one week ago from a specified future date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the given date, which is currently 08/03/1997. We need to find the date and time 24 hours in the future from the specified date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of time by 24 hours, which translates to one full day. The date will remain the same, and only the day component will change. In Prolog, this can be achieved by adding a specific number of days to the given date. The main consideration is ensuring that the correct date structure is used and that the addition of days handles the transition from one day to the next.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Increment by One Day:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day component (`DD`) by 1 while keeping the month and year components unchanged. For example, August 3, 1997, should be incremented to August 4, 1997.\n\n3. **Handling Day Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the rule resets the day to 1 when the month transitions (e.g., January 31 to February 1).\n\n4. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should utilize the one-day increment rule recursively to handle any number of days.\n\n5. **Leap Years:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific date, include a consideration for leap years to handle February dates correctly in general.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's pattern matching can be used to apply the correct rules for day transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the function with various dates to ensure that the day increments correctly, including dates at the end of months and during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately increment a date by a specified number of days, focusing on a simple and direct implementation to add one full day to the given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from the current date, which is September 9, 1909. To find this date, we need to subtract approximately 30 days from the current date, accounting for the varying lengths of the months.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a past date based on the current date by subtracting a certain duration, in this case, one month. The key consideration is the varying length of months, which means that the subtraction of days will involve different transitions depending on the current month. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle these varying transitions and adjust the month and day values accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations to subtract days.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the given date. This rule should consider the length of the current month and decrement the day accordingly.\n   - For example, if the current date is September 9, subtracting a day should lead to September 8.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rules:**\n   - Implement specific rules for each month's end dates, such as August 31 or September 30. Subtracting a day beyond these dates should transition to the previous month, adjusting the month and day values.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's end date correctly. In a leap year, February would end on the 29th day, while in a non-leap year, it would be the 28th day.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly subtracts one day from the given date until the desired number of days (approximately 30 for one month) is reached.\n   - This function should handle the transitions between different months and adjust the date accordingly.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to find and apply the correct rules for transitioning between months.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different starting dates, such as the last day of a month or a date within each month, and verify that the correct date one month ago is calculated.\n   - Test the logic for both leap years and non-leap years to ensure February is handled accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one month ago from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is September 9, 1909. To find this future date, we need to add seven days to the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of seven days to the current date. However, we must ensure that the addition does not cause an overflow into the next month or year. In this case, adding seven days to September 9 will keep us within the same month and year. In Prolog, we can implement a rule to handle this simple date arithmetic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that adds a specified number of days to a given date. For example, adding 7 days to September 9, 1909, should result in September 16, 1909.\n\n3. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Implement a condition in the rule to check if the addition would go beyond the last day of the month or year.\n   - If the addition causes a transition into the next month or year, handle it appropriately by updating the month or year values.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Although not required for this specific date, include a general rule to handle leap years, as they affect the number of days in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Addition:**\n   - Optionally, implement a recursive function that adds one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached. This can handle additions spanning multiple months or years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s rule application and pattern matching to ensure the correct application of the addition rule based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding days within the same month and across month boundaries, both in normal and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that can compute a date one week from today.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nToday's date is April 19, 1969, and the task is to determine the date 24 hours in the future. This simply involves adding 24 hours to the current time, which does not cross any month or year boundaries.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the current date, which falls within the same month and year. The main focus is on accurately handling the time increment without any month or year transitions. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for time addition, ensuring that the day component does not exceed the number of days in the current month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `time(HH, MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates and times.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy arithmetic operations on the time components (hours, minutes, etc.).\n\n2. **Add Time Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_time(time(HH, MM, DD, YYYY), Hours, NewTime)` that adds a specified number of hours to a given time. This function should handle the addition of hours and adjust the day if needed.\n\n3. **Day Boundary Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle cases where the added hours cause the day to exceed the number of days in the month. For example, if the current date is April 30 and we add 24 hours, the day should remain April 30, but the time will change.\n\n4. **Month and Year Non-Transition:**\n   - Include a rule stating that if the day does not exceed the month's days, both the month and year remain unchanged.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific case, include a general rule to handle leap years, which can affect day calculations in February.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find and apply the correct date transition logic based on the current date and time.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as adding hours that span across midnight, transitioning from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month, and leap year cases.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date and time 24 hours in the future from a given time, focusing on handling time increments and simple date transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday is today, and she was born on the last day of February in the year 2000. This means that today is February 29, 2016, as it is a leap year, and February has 29 days.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining the current date based on a specific event that occurred in the past. The key is to understand that the event is linked to a leap year, which not all years possess. We need to calculate 16 years from the date of Jane's birth, accounting for the leap year status of the current year. In Prolog, this can be approached by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle calculations involving years and leap years.\n\n2. **Leap Year Detection:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This is crucial for determining the number of days in February and making accurate date calculations.\n\n3. **Date Arithmetic:**\n   - Implement functions to add years to a given date, accounting for the leap year status of the years involved.\n   - For instance, adding 16 years to February 28, 2000, should result in February 28, 2016, while adding 16 years to February 29, 2000, should consider the leap year of 2016 and result in February 29, 2016.\n\n4. **Month and Day Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the day and month remain consistent when adding years. If the month's end date is exceeded, e.g., February 29 to March 1, the month and day should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to add years iteratively until the desired number of years (16) is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and the leap year detection rule to determine whether the current year is a leap year and apply the correct date arithmetic.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for non-leap and leap years, verifying that the date calculations are accurate, especially around month and day boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the current date based on Jane's birthday, considering leap years and date arithmetic.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday falls on the last day of February, which means today is indeed her special day. The task is to determine the date 10 days ago. To find this date, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date, which happens to be Jane's birthday.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is 10 days prior to a known current date. The current date happens to be on the last day of February, which adds a slight complication due to the varying lengths of months. In this case, we need to go back 10 days from February's last day, considering the month's end and potentially adjusting the year if necessary. Prolog's capabilities can be leveraged to define rules for handling such date arithmetic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, where MM represents the month, DD the day, and YYYY the four-digit year.\n   - Ensure that this structure can handle calculations involving day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a certain number of days from a given date. This rule should consider the end of the month and adjust the day and month accordingly when subtracting days from the last day of the month.\n   - For example, subtracting 10 days from February 29, 2000 (leap year), should result in February 19, 2000.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly identify the last day of February and adjust the date accordingly when subtracting days.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that allows for the subtraction of a variable number of days. This rule should repeatedly subtract one day until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n5. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. This is especially important when dealing with the end of February and the potential change in years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path when recursively subtracting days. This ensures that the correct date is determined based on the given conditions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal days within the month, the last day of the month, and days that span into the previous month or year.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles leap years and non-leap years for February transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate dates a certain number of days prior to a given date, especially when dealing with month boundaries and leap years.

The task is to determine the date exactly one month prior to today. This involves understanding the unique nature of February in leap years and handling the transition from one month to another.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate a date that is one month before the current date, accounting for the fact that today is a leap year and February has 29 days. This requires precise handling of month boundaries, especially the end of February, and the ability to identify leap years. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these date transitions and leverage Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date and year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. Ensure that this structure can handle different month lengths, especially February in leap years.\n\n2. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Write a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month and increments the month accordingly.\n   - For February, this rule should consider whether the year is a leap year or not. If it is a leap year and the day is February 29, the previous date should be February 28 of the same year.\n\n3. **Leap Year Detection:**\n   - Implement a rule to detect if the current year is a leap year. This rule will be crucial in determining the correct previous date for February.\n\n4. **Subtracting One Month:**\n   - Develop a function or predicate that subtracts one month from a given date. This function should handle the transition from February to January and decrement the month accordingly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the general case of subtracting one month.

The task is to determine the date one year ago from today's special occasion. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, and today is her 16th birthday, one year ago it was also the last day of February.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining the date exactly one year prior to today's date, with a specific focus on the end of February. We need to navigate the leap year scenario, as the last day of February can be either February 28 or February 29. In Prolog, we can manage this by implementing rules that account for both situations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.

This will help determine if the last day of February is February 29.\n\n3. **Calculate Last Day of February:**\n   - Implement a rule that calculates the last day of February for a given year. This rule should consider the leap year scenario and return either February 28 or February 29 accordingly.\n\n4. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a function or predicate that subtracts one year from a given date. This will likely involve changing the year component by -1 while keeping the month and day unchanged.\n\n5. **Leap Year Adjustment:**\n   - If the current date is in a leap year and the last day of February is February 29, subtracting one year should change it to February 28 in the previous year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct path when navigating through different dates and leap year considerations.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for both normal years and leap years to verify that the code correctly calculates the date one year ago, especially at the end of February.\n   - Test the scenario where today is indeed the last day of February, both in a leap year and a common year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately determines the date one year ago from today, with a focus on handling the last day of February and accounting for leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday falls on the last day of February, which means today is indeed her special day. The task is to determine the date one week ago from today. To find this date, we need to subtract seven days from today's date, which happens to be the last day of February.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one week prior to the current date, with a specific focus on the last day of February. This calculation requires understanding the unique characteristics of this month, especially regarding its variable length, including 28 days in most years and 29 days during leap years. In Prolog, we can manage these variations by implementing rules that handle different scenarios.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, where MM represents the month, DD the day, and YYYY the four-digit year.\n   - Ensure that this structure can handle calculations involving day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling the Last Day of February:**\n   - Write a rule that identifies the last day of February in a given year. This rule should be applicable to both leap years (February 29) and non-leap years (February 28).\n\n3. **Subtracting Days:**\n   - Implement a function or rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This function should handle the transition between days within the same month and adjust the day count if the starting day is the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Create a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly identifying the last day of February in the year 2000.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that allows for the subtraction of multiple days. This rule should repeatedly subtract a single day until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path when subtracting days, especially during the last days of February.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover both leap years and non-leap years. For instance, verify that subtracting 7 days from February 28, 2000, results in February 21, 2000, and subtracting 7 days from February 29, 2004 (a leap year), yields February 22, 2004.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Guide the user to input the current date, and then present the date one week ago, highlighting the importance of handling the last day of February correctly.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will accurately compute the date one week prior to the current date, with a special consideration for the last day of February.

        "question": "Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday falls on the last day of February, which means today is her special day. Being 16 years old implies that 16 years have passed since her birth in 2000. As a result, today's date is February 29, 2016, being the last day of February in the 16th year of the millennium. The task is now to determine the date one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nCalculating the date one week ahead requires understanding how days accumulate over time, especially when crossing month boundaries, in this case, the end of February. In Prolog, we can manage this by defining rules for date arithmetic, ensuring that the correct number of days is added while considering the varying lengths of months. Leap years also need consideration, as they affect the number of days in February.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Representing Dates:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format. This structure should allow for easy arithmetic operations on the day component.\n\n2. **Handling Normal Days:**\n   - Write a rule that adds one day to a given date. If the day is not the last of its month, this rule simply increments the day by 1. For instance, February 29 could be incremented to March 1.\n\n3. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year. This is crucial for handling February, as it has 29 days in leap years.\n\n4. **Adding Days Recursively:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should repeatedly add one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n5. **Special Handling for End of February:**\n   - Include a condition in the adding days function to handle the transition from February to March, especially when February has fewer days (non-leap years).\n\n6. **Using Prolog's Search and Recursion:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities and recursion to find and apply the correct rules for adding days, considering both normal and exceptional cases.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Create test cases that verify the functionality of the code across different situations: adding days within the same month, transitioning from February to March in both leap and non-leap years, and handling other month transitions.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date one week from today, accounting for the unique characteristics of February in both regular and leap years. This demonstrates the practical use of SWI-Prolog for real-world date manipulation scenarios.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday falls on the last day of February in the year 2016, and the task is to determine the date 24 hours after this special day. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, today's date is February 29, 2016, and 24 hours later will be February 29, 2016, but one day has passed.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding the specific date of Jane's birth (last day of February) and calculating a 24-hour increment from her 16th birthday. The key consideration is that February 29 is a special date due to it being a leap year. In Prolog, we can manage this by defining rules that account for this unique date and handling the regular day increment.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. Ensure that this structure can handle both regular days and the unique case of February 29.\n\n2. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Start by identifying the year 2016 as a leap year and defining a rule for February to account for its unique length of 29 days.\n\n3. **Regular Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day by 1 for all regular days, except February 29, which increments to March 1.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions to the next month and year. This is especially important for February, which transitions to March.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering the unique case of February 29.\n   - Ensure that the recursion stops at the correct date by managing the day increment logic appropriately.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date and the desired increment.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for regular days within a month and the transition from February 29 to March 1 in a leap year.\n   - Verify that the program handles February 28 in a non-leap year correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 24 hours after Jane's 16th birthday.

This means that today's date is February 28, 2017, as it is the last day of February in the 16th year of Jane's life. To find the date for tomorrow, we need to determine the date following February 28, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward transition from one day to the next, but it occurs at the end of a month. We need to handle the change from February to March while considering the year and day components. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by defining rules that manage month-end transitions and day increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule that handles the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month. For example, February 28 should transition to March 1 in the same year.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for incrementing the day by one when it's not the last day of the month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday falls on February 28, the last day of February, and today she celebrates her 16th birthday. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date. This means we are interested in the date corresponding to February 18, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a specific date that is a certain number of days prior to the current date. The challenge lies in handling date arithmetic, including the transition through different days within the same month and potentially across months or years. In this case, we need to go back 10 days from Jane's 16th birthday. Prolog can assist in solving this problem by providing rules for date manipulation and handling various transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates, focusing on the day, month, and year components.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write rules to subtract a certain number of days from a given date. Distinguish between normal days and the last day of the month.\n   - For example, subtracting 10 days from February 28 should result in February 18.\n\n3. **Month and Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition between different months, accounting for the varying days in each month.\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February's day count during leap years.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly subtracts one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n   - This function should handle the transitions and return the resulting date.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path through the recursive subtraction process.\n   - Ensure that the rules for day, month, and year transitions are applied accurately based on the current date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the subtraction function with various scenarios, including transitions between different days within a month, across months, and during leap years.\n   - Verify the correctness of the 10-day subtraction from today's date, considering the specific circumstances of Jane's birthday.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date 10 days ago from Jane's 16th birthday. This involves recursive date arithmetic and handling various calendar-related transitions. The program will provide a practical solution for real-world date manipulation scenarios.",

        "question": "Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday falls on February 28 (or February 29 during leap years) every year. Today, Jane is celebrating her 16th birthday, which means that today's date is her actual birthday. The task is to determine the date exactly one month prior to this special day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract one month from the current date, which happens to be Jane's birthday. This involves understanding the unique position of February as the shortest month and handling the transition from one month to another, especially considering the varying days in February due to leap years. In Prolog, we can manage these transitions by defining rules that account for the length of February and the change in months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. Ensure that this structure can handle changes in months and adjust for February's uniqueness.\n\n2. **Handling February Transitions:**\n   - Write a rule that checks if the current month is February and adjusts the day accordingly when subtracting a month. For instance, if the current date is February 28, the previous month should be January with the last day of the month. If it's February 29 (a leap year), then it should become January 31.\n\n3. **Normal Month Subtraction:**\n   - Define a rule for subtracting a month when the current date does not involve a February transition. This rule would simply decrement the month while keeping the day and year intact.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to handle February's day count correctly. This will ensure that February 29 in a leap year is treated differently from February 28 in a common year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the month subtraction, especially when crossing multiple month boundaries. Prolog's recursive capabilities will ensure that the correct transitions are made.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify when a February transition is needed and apply the special rule for that month.\n   - Let Prolog's search capabilities guide the recursive rules to find the correct date one month prior.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for both leap years and common years to verify that the program can handle February transitions correctly.\n   - Test the logic with different starting dates within February to ensure accurate month subtractions.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month prior to Jane's birthday, accounting for February's uniqueness and leap years.

As such, today's date is March 1, 2017, being 16 years old and February having 28 days in the non-leap year of 2001. One week from today would be the date of March 8, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on today's date, which happens to be the day after the last day of February. The key consideration is in handling the transition from February to March, ensuring the correct number of days in each month.

This rule should account for the varying lengths of February (28 or 29 days) and increment the month and year accordingly.\n\n3. **Normal Month Transition:**\n   - Implement a general rule for transitioning between any two months, accounting for the days in each month. This rule would handle the increment from March 1 to March 8.\n\n4. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Include a function to check if the current year is a leap year, which will affect the number of days in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that adds days to the current date, allowing us to navigate to the date one week ahead.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date and the desired transition. Pattern matching will help identify if the transition involves a change of months or not.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the function with various scenarios, including transitions within the same month and between different months, both in leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine future dates, especially those involving month transitions, by handling different month lengths and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John's golden wedding anniversary celebrates their 50 years of marriage. If they were married on January 2, 1958, then today's date must be January 2, 2008, exactly 50 years later.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves determining a specific date that is a fixed number of years in the future from a known past date. The logic required is to increment the year component of the date by a certain value while keeping the month and day intact. In this case, we need to add 50 years to January 2, 1958. Prolog can assist in this calculation by providing rules for year increments while maintaining the other date components.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent specific dates.\n   - Ensure that this structure permits operations that increment the year while preserving the month and day.\n\n2. **Increment Year Function:**\n   - Implement a function `increment_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewYear, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date. This function should accept and handle both positive and negative values for `NewYear`.\n\n3. **Preserving Month and Day:**\n   - Ensure that the function increments the year without altering the month and day values, except when a new century is entered, in which case the day might need resetting to the first day of the month (e.g., January 1st).\n\n4. **Century Transition:**\n   - Handle the transition between centuries correctly. For instance, 50 years after 1958 would enter the new century, and January 2, 2008, should be the result.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include leap year checks to ensure that the correct number of days is attributed to February when incrementing years. This is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the date calculation.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the year increment function with a provided increment value. This will handle any positive or negative number of years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to manage the century transition and ensure the correct date is produced.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the function with various inputs, including dates that cross century boundaries and leap years, to ensure the correct results.\n   - Verify that incrementing and decrementing years yields the expected outcomes.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can compute a specific future date based on a given past date and a provided number of years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their golden wedding anniversary today, which means they were married 50 years ago on January 2, 1958. Today's date is January 2, 2008. To find the date tomorrow, we simply need to add one day to this special anniversary date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of one day to the current date. There are no month or year transitions to consider, making this a relatively simple date calculation. However, we still need to ensure that the code handles such transitions in a general solution. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle day increments and manage different scenarios.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a suitable structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. For instance, if `DD` is 2, then the next date should be January 3.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not required for this specific date, implement rules to handle transitions between months and years in case the day exceeds the maximum days in a month or December.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a consideration for leap years to correctly manage February dates.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, accounting for potential month and year transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct increment rule based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - In addition to testing the specific date mentioned in the problem (January 2, 2008), include test cases that cross month and year boundaries to ensure the code functions correctly in all scenarios.\n   - Verify that the program handles leap years accurately for February dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can determine tomorrow's date from a given date, even when transitions between months or years are involved.

If their wedding date was January 2, 1958, then a month ago from this special day was December 2, 1957.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is exactly one month prior to a given significant date. The key consideration is understanding how dates revert one month while accounting for different month lengths. In this scenario, we need to navigate the transition from January to December, which has one day less. In Prolog, we can manage this by establishing rules for month decrementing and handling the transition between months with varying day counts.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Represent Date Structure:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to encapsulate dates. This structure should support operations that subtract months.\n\n2. **Decrement Month Function:**\n   - Implement a function `decrement_month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that reduces the month while adjusting the day and year accordingly. If `MM` is 1 (January) and `DD` is 2nd, the new date should be December 2, 1957.\n\n3. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to handle transitions between months with different day counts.

This process should continue until reaching the desired month decrement.\n\n6. **Pattern Matching and Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's pattern matching to identify the appropriate transition rules based on the current date. Its search capabilities will help in finding the correct solution.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, including those that span month boundaries, leap years, and non-leap years, to ensure the correct handling of month decrementing.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in creating a Prolog program that can compute a date one month prior for any given input date.

In Prolog, we can implement this by defining rules for year subtraction and ensuring that the correct month and day are maintained during this process.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent specific dates.\n   - This structure should be able to handle year decrements while preserving the month and day.\n\n2. **Decrement Year Function:**\n   - Implement a function `decrement_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that reduces the year by 1 while maintaining the month and day. This function should handle the transition from the end of one year to the beginning of the next.\n\n3. **Handling Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to manage the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the previous year. This ensures that the day and month remain unchanged during the year decrement.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Account for leap years to ensure that the correct date is calculated, especially when dealing with February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the year decrement function repeatedly until the year is decremented by one.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct transition rules based on the input date.\n   - Ensure that the recursive application of the decrement year function is applied correctly.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the function with various dates, including those spanning across different years, months, and leap years, to ensure the logic handles all scenarios correctly.\n   - Verify that the program can correctly subtract one year from a given date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine a date one year prior to a given date, considering year transitions and maintaining the month and day components correctly.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane and John celebrated their golden wedding anniversary today, which means they were married 50 years ago. Considering the date of their marriage was January 2, 1958, today's date is January 2, 2008. One week ago from this special day would be December 26, 2007.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one week prior to the current date, which happens to be a special anniversary. The key is to perform this calculation while accounting for the number of days in each month to ensure accurate transitions. In this case, we need to navigate from January 2nd back in time by seven days. Prolog can assist in this calculation by providing rules for month and day transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date representation format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to describe dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that this structure allows for arithmetic operations, such as subtracting days.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function that subtracts a certain number of days from a given date. This function should handle day and month transitions correctly.\n   - For example, subtracting 7 days from January 2, 2008, should result in December 26, 2007.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition between months with different numbers of days. When subtracting days, ensure that the day and month are adjusted accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Develop a rule to check for leap years. This is crucial for accurately handling February dates during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a recursive mechanism within the subtraction function to subtract multiple days by repeatedly calling the single-day subtraction function.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path through the recursive subtraction, especially when crossing month boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the subtraction function across various scenarios, including transitions between months and leap years, to ensure its accuracy.\n   - Verify that the program can correctly subtract 7 days from January 2, 2008, resulting in the desired date.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date one week ago from a given date, accounting for various month lengths and year transitions.

She remembers that her second day at work was December 2, which means today's date must be December 2, three years later, in 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the current date based on a memorable past date and the passage of three years. The key is to identify the correct date three years after December 2, 2016. This requires understanding time progression and handling year transitions. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage date arithmetic, including year increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy arithmetic operations on dates.\n\n2. **Date Arithmetic:**\n   - Write a rule to add a specified number of years to a given date. This rule should handle the increment of the year component while keeping the month and day intact.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions across years. For instance, if the original date is in December, the following December should be selected in the incremented year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly manage the days in February. This is crucial when adding years to ensure the correct date is calculated.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a function that adds three years to a given date, considering the year transition.\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date and the desired operation.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correctness of the three-year addition, especially around month and year transitions and leap years.\n   - Validate that the function handles dates like December 31 correctly, which would transition to January 1 of the following year.\n\n7. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a memorable past date and receive the calculated date three years later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can determine the current date based on a past date and a specified time passage (in this case, three years).

We have to calculate the date three years after December 2, 2016, and then increment by one day to find the date for tomorrow. This requires basic date arithmetic and understanding year transitions.

        "question": "Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's work anniversary falls on the date she started working, which was in 2016. Today marks her 3-year work anniversary, meaning that today's date is exactly three years after her first day at work. Jane also remembers that her second day at work was December 2, which helps us narrow down the potential dates for today. Our task is to determine the date 10 days ago from this special work anniversary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the date that is a certain number of days (10) prior to today's date, which happens to be Jane's 3-year work anniversary. To solve this, we need to calculate the date three years ago and then subtract 10 days from that. This requires understanding date arithmetic, including handling transitions between days, months, and years. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations on dates.\n\n2. **Calculate Start Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the starting date, which is Jane's first day at work. Since it's three years ago from today, we need to subtract three years from the current year. If today is indeed December 2, then the starting date is December 2, three years prior.\n\n3. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Implement a function to subtract a certain number of days (in this case, 10) from a given date. This function should handle transitions between days, months, and years correctly.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For instance, if we subtract 10 days from December 2, we end up in November of the same year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and should be considered during date calculations.\n\n6. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly until it reaches zero days. This function will handle the subtraction of any given number of days.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and pattern matching to determine the correct transitions and apply the appropriate rules based on the date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the date subtraction across different scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and verify the correctness of the 10-day subtraction.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that calculates the date 10 days ago from Jane's 3-year work anniversary.

This function should handle the transitions across months and years accurately.\n\n3. **Subtract Years Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that does the opposite of `add_years`, moving the date backward in time by subtracting years.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the functions for adding and subtracting years correctly handle the transitions between months and years, considering the number of days in each month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to accurately handle February dates when adding or subtracting years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the year addition and subtraction functions to handle multiple years. For instance, adding three years should be done by adding one year three times.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to find the correct dates based on the input date and the number of years to add or subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the functionality of the year addition and subtraction functions across different months and years, including leap years.\n   - Test the scenario of adding three years to December 2, 2016, to confirm it produces December 2, 2019, and then subtract one year from this result.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one year ago from Jane's three-year work anniversary. This involves both adding and subtracting years from dates while handling various date transitions and special cases, such as leap years.",

        "question": "Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's work anniversary is today, which marks three years since she started her job in 2016. As Jane remembers her second day at work, which was December 2, we need to calculate the date one week prior to today's work anniversary. This will help us find the date of December 2, one week before Jane spilled coffee on her laptop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date based on a known present date and a specific anniversary event. We need to determine the date that was three years ago from today and then subtract one more week from that date. This requires careful consideration of date arithmetic, including month and year transitions, to accurately calculate the desired date. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date manipulation to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for date calculations.\n\n2. **Three-Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract three years from the current date. This involves decrementing the year component by three and handling any necessary adjustments to the month and day.\n\n3. **Week Subtraction:**\n   - After determining the date three years ago, write another rule to subtract one week from that date. This may involve multiple days' subtraction and handling transitions across months or even years.\n\n4. **Handling Day and Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between days, months, and years when subtracting weeks. For instance, if the starting date is December 2, one week prior would land in November, requiring a month decrement.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to accurately handle February dates when subtracting weeks.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules along with Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to determine the correct date three years and one week ago. The search capabilities will help find the appropriate transitions and apply the correct rules.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various starting dates, including dates in December, to verify the correct handling of month and year transitions.\n   - Ensure that the program can handle different anniversary periods, not just three years.\n\n8. **User Input and Explanation:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a description of the anniversary event (e.g., \"second day at work\") and the corresponding date.\n   - Provide a clear explanation of the logic used to solve the problem, including the date calculations and transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that calculates a past date based on a present anniversary date and the user's description of the event.

        "question": "Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's work anniversary falls on the day she completed three years at her job, which is today. She recalls that her second day at work was December 2, 2016. The task is to determine the date 24 hours after this memorable event.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date and time that is 24 hours after a specific event that occurred in the past. The key is to identify the starting date, which is December 2, 2016, and then perform time arithmetic to find the date 24 hours later. This requires understanding date and time manipulation, including handling the transition between days. In Prolog, this can be accomplished using date manipulation functions and arithmetic operations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent both dates and times.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle time arithmetic operations, such as adding hours.\n\n2. **Base Date Identification:**\n   - Define a rule that identifies the base date as December 2, 2016, given Jane's recollection.\n\n3. **Time Arithmetic:**\n   - Implement a function to add a specified number of hours to a given datetime. This function should handle the transition from one day to the next, adjusting the date accordingly when crossing the 24-hour boundary.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and ensures correct date calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Addition of Hours:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly adds one hour to a given datetime until the desired number of hours (24) is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules based on the current datetime.\n   - Pattern matching will help identify when a new day begins, triggering the necessary date and time adjustments.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the time addition function with various scenarios, including cases where the specified time crosses midnight into the next day, and verify the correct date and time are returned.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a prompt that allows users to input a memorable date and time event like Jane's coffee incident. The program should then calculate and display the date and time 24 hours later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can calculate dates and times based on past events, considering time transitions and leap years. This will provide a practical tool for handling time arithmetic and solving real-world problems involving date manipulation.",

        "question": "Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the current date, knowing that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and that 176 days have passed since then. To find today's date, we need to add 176 days to March 20, 2020. This calculation may involve crossing month and year boundaries, requiring a thoughtful approach.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date by adding a certain number of days to a given baseline date. We need to handle transitions between months and years, ensuring the correct date is determined even when spanning multiple months or years. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations for adding days to a date.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function that adds a specified number of days to a given date. If the resulting date exceeds the days in the current month, it should transition to the next month accordingly. For example, adding 10 days to March 20 should result in April 1.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. For instance, if we start in March (which has 31 days), and add 59 days, we should end up in May of the same year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial when adding days across February's boundary.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that adds a single day at a time until the desired number of days is reached. This function should handle the transitions mentioned above.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive capabilities to apply the correct rules and find the appropriate date based on the given starting date and the number of days to add.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, crossing month boundaries, and handling leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly calculates dates even when adding a large number of days, like 176 days in this case.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can determine the current date based on a historical event date and the passage of a specified number of days.

To find this date, we need to subtract 176 days from the current date, which is a known reference point in our problem.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a specific date by subtracting a certain number of days from a known starting date. The challenge lies in handling date transitions across months and years as we move backward in time. In this case, subtracting 176 days may span over multiple months and possibly years. In Prolog, we can develop rules to handle these transitions and use recursive logic to perform the day subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date representation structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to handle various dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for flexible day, month, and year manipulations.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write rules to subtract a certain number of days from a given date. When subtracting days, consider transitions between months and handle the corresponding day and month adjustments.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between years when subtracting days. This would involve decrementing the year when the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to accurately handle the days in February during the subtraction process.\n\n5. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (176) has been subtracted.\n   - This recursive approach will handle different scenarios, including transitions across multiple months and years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules during the recursive subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include diverse test cases to validate the program's accuracy, especially those that involve crossing month and year boundaries, as well as leap years.\n   - Verify that the program can handle various day counts, not just limited to 176 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that calculates a specific date based on a given starting date and the number of days to subtract. This program will require managing date transitions and will showcase the practical application of Prolog for date calculations.",

In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and leverage the recursive capabilities of the language.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations like day addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function to add a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions gracefully by incrementing the month or year when necessary.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial when adding or subtracting days spanning February.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day addition rule until the desired number of days (176 days) is reached.\n\n5. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - After determining today's date, write a rule to subtract one year from it. This will likely involve changing the year, but also check if any adjustments to the day or month are needed.\n\n6. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Handle the special case of January 1 by adjusting the year correctly when subtracting one year.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules for date transitions and calculations.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that involve adding days across different months and years and subtracting one year, covering leap years, normal years, and scenarios where days span across key boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that first calculates today's date by adding 176 days to a known date and then determines the date one year ago from today. This involves both date addition and subtraction, handling various scenarios and special cases effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today. Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and since then, 176 days have passed. We need to calculate the date 176 days ago from today and then subtract an additional seven days. This involves understanding the day count within months and years and handling transitions accordingly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we will need to perform two sequential calculations: first, subtracting 176 days from today's date, and then subtracting another 7 days from that resulting date. This requires a clear understanding of date arithmetic, including month and year transitions, and handling the cumulative effect of the days subtracted. In Prolog, we can achieve this by implementing rules for day subtraction and applying them recursively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that this structure supports operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Initial Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days (176 days, in this case) from the current date. This rule should handle transitions between months and years when necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting days. For instance, if the starting day is January 31 and we subtract 176 days, the resulting day should be adjusted to the last day of July.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to determine leap years, as this affects the number of days in February and potentially other months.\n\n6. **Additional Day Subtraction:**\n   - After finding the date 176 days ago, write another rule to subtract an additional 7 days from that date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after a specific event in the past. Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. We need to calculate the date and time 24 hours after this event.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date and time in the future based on a past event. We know the starting date, which is March 20, 2020, and the number of days that have passed since then. The key is to add the specified number of days to the starting date and then further increment by 24 hours. This may involve handling transitions between days, months, and potentially years. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these temporal calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent both date and time.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for both date and time increments.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function to add a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle day, month, and year transitions gracefully. For example, adding 176 days to March 20, 2020, should result in September 5, 2020.\n\n3. **Increment Time:**\n   - After adding the days, we need to increment the time by 24 hours. This may involve adjusting the hours, minutes, and seconds accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in a year and thus the date calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of days and the time increment. This ensures that complex date transitions are correctly managed.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules for date and time transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between days, months, and years, and also verify the time increment.\n   - Test the addition of various numbers of days to ensure the logic handles different cases correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date and time 24 hours after a past event.

This suggests that we are currently in the early hours of January 1, 2015, and the date today is January 1, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward determination of the current date. However, the reference to the approaching year 2015 implies that the current time is close to the beginning of the new year. The key is to understand that the current date is January 1, 2015, which needs to be represented in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a simple structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent the current date.\n   - Ensure that the structure covers the current scenario of being close to the new year transition.\n\n2. **New Year Transition:**\n   - Write a rule that identifies when the year transitions to the next one. For instance, if the month is December and the day is 31, the current date is the transition to the new year.\n\n3. **Normal Date Identification:**\n   - Develop a rule to identify the current date when it's not the new year transition. This would simply be a matter of pattern matching on the date structure.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, as it's crucial to handle February's date range correctly.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date for tomorrow, considering that the year 2015 will begin in 36 hours.

Therefore, tomorrow will be the first day of the year 2015, represented as 01/01/2015 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward transition from one day to the next, but it occurs at the year-end boundary. The key is to recognize that today is December 31, 2014, and tomorrow will be January 1, 2015. This change spans a new year, which requires a special handling logic in the code. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage this year-end transition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle both regular day transitions and year-end transitions.\n\n2. **Normal Day Transition:**\n   - Write a rule for regular day transitions, where the day is incremented by 1 within the same month.\n\n3. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a special rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the following year. This rule should increment the year and reset the month and day to the beginning of the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Although not applicable for this specific transition, include a rule to check for leap years to handle February dates in other scenarios.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to determine tomorrow's date based on today's date.

Therefore, yesterday was the last day of 2014, which falls on December 31, 2014.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the date that was exactly one day before the current date. We need a logic that handles the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month and year boundaries.

In this case, we only need to subtract one day, but the logic should handle any number of days.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Employ Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date.

As time moves forward, we need to calculate a date that is one year before today. This involves subtracting one year from the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we simply need to decrement the year by one while considering the current month and day. The key is to recognize that the month and day remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the passage of a year. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining a straightforward rule for year subtraction while preserving the month and day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy manipulation of years, months, and days.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one year from the given date. The month and day should remain the same during this operation. For example, if the current date is 01/01/2015, subtracting one year should result in 01/01/2014.\n\n3. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Include a check to handle potential overflows or underflows of the day or month components, though this is not common within a one-year range.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Determine if the current year is a leap year, which might affect the number of days in February. However, this consideration is not necessary for the given scenario, as we are focused on the current year and the previous year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Although simple subtraction is involved, leverage Prolog\u2019s recursive rules and search capabilities to apply the year subtraction logic correctly.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the functionality of the year subtraction across different months and days. For instance, subtracting one year from 12/31/2015 should yield 12/31/2014.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a straightforward Prolog program that subtracts one year from a given date, accounting for any special cases that might arise.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to find the date that was one week ago from today, knowing that the year 2015 will begin in 36 hours. As there are 24 hours in a day, we can deduce that 36 hours from now will be in the early hours of January 1, 2015. Therefore, today is December 28, 2014.

This structure should support arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Create a rule that subtracts a single day from the given date. The rule should also handle cases where the day reaches the end of the month, causing a transition to the previous month. For example, subtracting one day from December 31 would result in December 30.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Write logic to manage transitions between months and years when subtracting days. This involves understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly.\n   - A special case arises when subtracting days from January; we must decrement the year and set the month to December.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that iteratively applies the single-day subtraction rule. This will enable us to subtract any desired number of days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Integrate a leap year check to accurately handle the days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search Features:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to automatically apply the appropriate rules based on the current date's structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Test the developed rules with various cases, including transitions between months and years, as well as leap years, to ensure the accuracy of the day subtraction.\n\nThe code prompt will assist the user in constructing a Prolog program that can determine the date one week ago from any given date, accounting for intricate transitions and scenarios such as different months and leap years. This will be accomplished by defining rules for day subtraction and leveraging Prolog's capabilities for recursive execution and search.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe objective is to find the date 24 hours after the beginning of the year 2015, which is approaching in 36 hours. Since 24 hours is equivalent to one full day, we need to determine the date that follows January 1, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding 24 hours (or equivalently, one day) to the initial date. We must account for the transition from one day to the next, ensuring that the correct date is determined, especially at the boundary between days. In Prolog, we can establish rules that manage day increments and identify when a day rolls over to the next.\n\n**Plan for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt Creation:**\n\n1. **Date Representation Definition:**\n   - Implement a date representation using a structure such as `date(DD, MM, YYYY)`.\n   - Ensure that the structure supports operations for incrementing days.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increases the day number (`DD`) by 1. For instance, if the date is January 1, 2015, then the subsequent date should be January 2, 2015.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - When the day reaches the last day of the month, implement a mechanism to roll over to the first day of the subsequent month. For example, when incrementing from December 31, the year should be incremented, and the month should reset to January.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Integrate a check for leap years to manage the number of days in February accurately.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Day Increment:**\n   - Employ recursive rules to handle the progression from one day to the next, incorporating month and year transitions when necessary.\n\n6. **Capitalizing on Prolog's Search Functions:**\n   - Take advantage of Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to ensure that the appropriate rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Include test cases that cover regular day transitions, month boundaries, and year transitions to validate the correctness of the day increment function.\n\nThe code prompt will assist users in developing a Prolog program to determine the date 24 hours after a specified date, accounting for daily transitions and various cases.

This rule should decrement the year component (`YYYY`) by 1 while keeping the month (`MM`) and day (`DD`) intact.\n   - For example, subtracting one year from `date(02, 01, 1987)` should result in `date(02, 01, 1986)`.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check if the current year is a leap year.

        "question": "In the UK, people usually put the day before the month when formatting the date. Therefore, today is 02/01/1987 to them. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, following the UK date format where the day comes before the month. Today's date is represented as 02/01/1987, meaning it is January 2, 1987. To find the date one week ago, we need to calculate seven days prior to January 2, 1987.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves basic date arithmetic, subtracting seven days from a given date. However, we must account for the UK date format, where the day comes first. This requires a clear understanding of how to handle transitions between days, months, and potentially years when subtracting days. In Prolog, we can implement rules and leverage pattern matching to handle these transitions and format the date correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a custom structure, such as `date_uk(DD, MM, YYYY)`, to represent dates in the UK format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a date. If the day is the first of the month, it should wrap around to the last day of the previous month. For example, subtracting one day from 01/01/1987 should result in 31/12/1986.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions to the previous month and year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the month and potentially the year when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial for accurate date calculations involving February.\n\n5. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly subtracts one day from the date until the desired number of days (in this case, 7) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the appropriate transitions when subtracting days. This ensures that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between months and years, and check if the program correctly handles leap years when subtracting days from dates in February.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date one week ago from a given date in the UK format. This involves understanding date arithmetic, handling transitions, and applying these concepts using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane has booked a flight for tomorrow, which is currently scheduled for July 29, 2002. The task is to determine the date that corresponds to tomorrow's scheduled flight. This involves calculating the date for the day after today, given the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the transition from today's date to the following day. This is a straightforward calculation that does not involve any month or year boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining a simple rule that increments the day while keeping the month and year intact.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy arithmetic operations on the day component.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 while keeping the month (`MM`) and year (`YYYY`) the same. For example, July 28, 2002, should transition to July 29, 2002.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement a condition to reset the day to the first of the month if it exceeds the number of days in that month. This is not necessary for the current scenario but will handle general cases.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. However, this is not required for the given scenario.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the day increment rule and find the correct transition.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the day increment function, such as transitioning from July 30 to July 31.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that calculates the date for tomorrow, focusing on incrementing the day while keeping the month and year unchanged.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's behavior of visiting the bookstore on the 16th of every month implies that today is the 5th such occurrence, starting from October 2009. We need to determine the current date based on this information. This can be achieved by calculating the number of months between Jane's first visit and the current visit and then adding the target date (16th) to the starting date (October 16, 2009).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date calculations based on a recurring event. We need to find the date corresponding to the 5th occurrence of Jane's bookstore visit. This requires us to handle month arithmetic, ensuring that we add the correct number of months to the base date while considering the days within those months. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these calculations, including handling the varying days in different months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should allow for month and day arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Month and Day Arithmetic:**\n   - Write rules to perform addition and subtraction of months and days. These rules should handle the varying days in different months and manage the transitions between them.\n\n3. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the target day crosses into a new year. For example, if the target day is January 16 and the starting month is December, we should increment the year accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Adjustment:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly when adding or subtracting months.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to find the nth occurrence of Jane's visit. This rule should add the appropriate number of months to the base date, adjusting the day as needed, until the target occurrence (5th) is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive capabilities to find the correct date based on the provided information.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different occurrences of Jane's visits (e.g., 3rd, 6th) and verify that the program correctly handles the date calculations.\n   - Test the program for the first and last occurrences, as well as those that span multiple years.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a clear and user-friendly prompt that allows users to input the occurrence number and the starting date to find the corresponding date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in constructing a Prolog program that determines the current date based on Jane's bookstore visits.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's habit of visiting the bookstore on the 16th of every month creates a recurring monthly pattern. If today is her fifth visit, then we need to determine the date of the previous visit, which was the fourth trip to the bookstore. This visit would have occurred on the 16th of the previous month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date corresponding to the 16th of the previous month. This involves understanding monthly transitions and ensuring that the correct month and day values are maintained. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle these monthly transitions and determine the date based on Jane's visit pattern.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like determining the date of the 16th of each month.\n\n2. **Monthly Transition Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that adjusts the date to the 16th day of the same month if the day is greater than 16. For example, if the date is 25/02/2010, the rule would change it to 16/02/2010.\n\n3. **Previous Month Calculation:**\n   - Implement a rule to calculate the date of the 16th in the previous month. This involves decrementing the month while keeping the day and year intact.\n\n4. **Handling Year Transition:**\n   - If the previous month is January, we need to decrement the year as well. Write a rule to handle this year transition when going back to the previous month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to ensure the correct number of days in February is maintained when calculating dates.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog's search capabilities to determine the date of the fourth visit based on Jane's pattern. Start from the known date and recursively apply the monthly transition rule until the fourth visit is reached.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different months and years to validate the correctness of the monthly transition and year transitions.\n   - Verify that the program handles leap years accurately for February dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date of Jane's previous bookstore visit based on her monthly pattern.

The task is to determine the date 10 days ago during this fifth month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date based on a recurring event that happens on the 16th of each month. The key is to determine the current month and day number relative to Jane's first visit, and then subtract 10 days accordingly.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's visits to the bookstore occur on the 16th of every month. If it's her fifth visit today, then she started going to the bookstore in October, which means today is the 16th day of the fifth month since her first visit. One year ago from today would be the 16th day of the fourth month after her first visit, which was October 2009.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date based on a recurring event that happens on the 16th of each month. We need to determine the date one year ago from this recurring event's current occurrence. This requires understanding the monthly cycle and the ability to subtract one year while considering month and day boundaries. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle monthly arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Monthly Event:**\n   - Define a rule for the monthly event, setting the date to the 16th of a given month.\n\n3. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This rule should handle the transition between years, adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n\n4. **Month and Day Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the correct alignment of the day and month when subtracting a year. For example, if the starting date is January 31, the date one year ago should be December 31.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to ensure the correct number of days in February during the year subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the date of the fifth monthly event from the initial visit (October 2009).\n   - Apply the one-year subtraction rule to this date to calculate the date one year ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different starting months and verify that the correct date is calculated after subtracting one year.\n   - Test the logic for cases where the starting date is near the end of the year to ensure the transition to the previous year is handled correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that simulates Jane's bookstore visits and accurately calculates the date one year ago from her current visit.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to determine the current month and year, then increment the day by one, considering any necessary month transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding Jane's unique visiting pattern and calculating the date 24 hours in the future based on this pattern. We need to determine the current date by calculating the fifth occurrence of the 16th day from October 2009. This can be achieved by identifying the number of months between October and the current month and then adding the appropriate number of 16th days. In Prolog, this can be implemented using recursive rules and date manipulation functions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Base Case and Fifth Visit Calculation:**\n   - Define a base case for the current date.

The logic required is to add a single day while considering potential month boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved using date manipulation functions and rules that handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that this structure supports basic arithmetic operations to add days.\n\n2. **Day Increment Function:**\n   - Implement a function called `increment_day` that adds one day to a given date. This function should handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month.\n\n3. **Recursive Logic for Increment:**\n   - Use recursion to handle consecutive day increments. A function like `add_days(Date, Days)` can be used to add a specified number of days to a date recursively by calling `increment_day` repeatedly.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to handle transitions between months and years when incrementing days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was one day prior to the actual date, which Jane believed to be March 11, 2002, but which is in fact March 12, 2002. Therefore, we need to calculate the date one day before March 12, 2002.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward decrement of the current date by one day. The logic required is to understand that days can be decremented within the same month, and potentially handle the transition to the previous month if necessary. In Prolog, we can implement this by defining a rule that subtracts a day from the date and checks if the date has crossed over to the previous month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for day decrements within the same month.\n\n2. **Normal Day Decrement:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the first day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 12, then the previous date should be March 11, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-Beginning Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when decrementing the day and reaching the first day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 1, the previous date should be February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year) of the same year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February when decrementing days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the input date and identify when a month transition occurs.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day decrements (e.g., March 12 to March 11) and cases that involve month transitions (e.g., March 1 to February 28).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one day prior to a given date, accounting for potential month transitions and leap years.

Therefore, the correct date is represented as 01/02/2007 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of time by 24 hours, which translates to one day.

For example, changing January 1 (01/01/2007) to January 2 (01/02/2007).\n\n3. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific case, define rules to handle transitions at the ends of months and years.

Today is April 10, 1985, and Jane's appointment is on April 13, 1985. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract another 10 days from Jane's appointment date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves performing date arithmetic, specifically subtracting a certain number of days from a given date, while also handling the transitions between days, months, and years. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by defining rules for date manipulation, ensuring that the correct transitions are made when days are subtracted.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent specific dates.\n   - This structure should allow for arithmetic operations, making it possible to add or subtract days.\n\n2. **Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transitions between days, months, and years when subtracting days. For example, if subtracting 10 days from April 13, it should result in April 3, 1985.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules within the subtraction function to handle transitions between months and years when days are subtracted. Account for different month lengths and the rolling over of days.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to ensure accurate handling of February dates during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion within the subtraction function to iteratively subtract each day from the provided date until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules for transitions based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and check if the program correctly handles dates 10 days ago.\n   - For example, testing the program with April 13, 1985, should return April 3, 1985, as the result.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that performs date arithmetic, focusing on subtracting a specified number of days from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, which is currently April 10, 1985. To find this date, we need to calculate three days before the specified date and then subtract an additional seven days. This involves understanding day and week transitions and handling them appropriately.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a combination of day subtraction and understanding the concept of a week. We need to subtract three days first and then follow up with a week subtraction, adjusting for any overflows into the previous week. In Prolog, we can manage these transitions using recursive rules and date manipulation functions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations such as day and week subtractions.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should handle transitions between months and years if needed.\n   - For example, subtracting three days from April 10, 1985, should result in April 7, 1985.\n\n3. **Week Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one week from a given date. This rule should decrement the week number and adjust the day accordingly to account for the beginning of the previous week.\n\n4. **Handling Week Transitions:**\n   - When subtracting weeks, ensure that the resulting date is correctly adjusted to the last day of the previous week. This may involve finding the last day of the week for the given date.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop recursive rules for both day and week subtractions. These rules should repeatedly apply the respective subtraction rules until reaching the desired number of days or weeks.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly, especially when subtracting weeks, as the number of days in a week can cross into February.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules for both day and week transitions.\n   - Ensure that the rules for multiple day and week subtractions are correctly applied.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with scenarios that involve multiple day and week subtractions, including cases where the initial date is near month or year boundaries.\n   - Verify that the program can handle consecutive day and week subtractions correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one week ago from a given date, accounting for both day and week transitions, and leveraging Prolog's capabilities to handle these transitions effectively.",

Ensure that the function handles the transition to the next day if the added time exceeds 24 hours.\n\n4. **Compose and Decompose Datetime:**\n   - Create functions to compose a complete datetime structure from separate date and time components and to decompose a datetime structure back into its individual components.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly add days until the desired number of days is reached.\n   - Similarly, use recursion to add time incrementally until the full 24 hours are added.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct operations are performed based on the input date and time.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days and time across month boundaries and handling leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles time additions, especially when crossing the midnight boundary.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date and time 24 hours after Jane's appointment, accounting for day and time transitions and ensuring accurate date and time representations.",

This involves understanding and handling the transition between months and ensuring the correct year is maintained.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem requires calculating a specific date that is one month before the given date, March 5, 1973.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane has witnessed a meteor shower twice in the year 1973, and today is the second occurrence, currently on March 5, 1973. The task is to determine the date one week from today. This involves calculating seven days ahead from the given date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic by adding seven days to the current date. This may require handling transitions between days, months, and potentially years. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and use recursive logic to handle the addition of multiple days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Day Addition Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that adds one day to the input date. This rule should consider month boundaries, incrementing the month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month (e.g., adding one day to March 31 should result in April 1).\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions to the next month and year when adding days. For instance, adding days to December should transition to January of the following year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly manage February dates during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that adds a specified number of days (in this case, seven days) to a given date. This function should repeatedly apply the one-day addition rule until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules for date transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and into the next year, including leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date one week from the given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of yesterday, given that Jane ate pizza and wings yesterday, which was January 21, 2011. We need to calculate the date one day prior to January 21, 2011. This involves a straightforward decrement of the day while keeping the month and year intact.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a simple decrement of the day value without any complex transitions. However, we need to ensure that the date calculation handles the day rollback correctly. In Prolog, we can implement a straightforward rule to manage this day decrement and verify the logic with different test cases.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy arithmetic operations, especially decrementing the day.\n\n2. **Decrement Day:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day from the given date. For example, January 21, 2011, should become January 20, 2011.\n\n3. **Basic Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the day decrement logic, such as subtracting one day from various dates within the same month and year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific problem, include a basic check for leap years to handle February dates in general date arithmetic.\n\n5. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a simple user interface where users can input a date in MM/DD/YYYY format and receive the previous day's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to implement a straightforward Prolog program that calculates the date of yesterday based on a given date.

In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining a rule that subtracts one year from a given date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one year from a given date. This rule should decrement the `YYYY` value by 1 while keeping the month and day intact.\n\n3. **User Input and Output:**\n   - Create a user-friendly function that allows users to input a date in the MM/DD/YYYY format and receives the output of the date one year ago.\n\n4. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correctness of the one-year subtraction, especially around month boundaries and leap years. For example, subtracting one year from December 31, 2011, should result in December 31, 2010.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to implement a simple Prolog program that calculates the date one year ago from a given date. This involves understanding the date representation and applying a straightforward year subtraction rule. The program will be particularly useful for basic date arithmetic without complex transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that yesterday was January 21, 2011. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from the current date, which is January 22, 2011.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, where today is correctly believed to be June 18, 2019, according to Jane. To find this date, we need to subtract one year from the current date, which is June 18, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward subtraction of one year from the given date. However, we must ensure that the day and month remain consistent after performing this subtraction, as the number of days in a year doesn't evenly divide into the days and months of a calendar year. In Prolog, we can implement a rule to handle this year subtraction while maintaining the correct month and day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations, including year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one year from a given date. When subtracting a year, check if the resulting year has the same month and day of the month. If not, adjust the day to match the original day of the week. For example, if June 18 becomes May 17 after subtracting a year, it should be adjusted back to June 17.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the day goes below 1 or the month goes below January. In such cases, decrement the year and adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the year is a leap year. This is important to handle the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Although year subtraction is a simple arithmetic operation, use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and search functions to apply the year subtraction rule and handle any potential overflows or adjustments to the date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different starting dates, spanning different months and years, to ensure the year subtraction rule is working correctly.\n   - Verify that the program handles both leap years and non-leap years accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one year ago from a given date, considering all necessary adjustments to keep the day and month intact after subtracting a year. This involves a straightforward application of rules for year subtraction while being mindful of calendar anomalies.",

This involves recognizing when the year changes or when a month with fewer days is encountered.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and requires special handling during subtractions spanning February.\n\n6. **Application of Prolog's Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and recursion to find and apply the correct rules for date transitions as days are subtracted. Ensure that the appropriate rule is selected based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the subtraction function with various scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and verify the correct date is obtained.\n   - Specifically, test the function with June 19, 2019, to confirm the date 10 days ago is accurately calculated.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine historical dates by subtracting days from a given present date. This will involve recursive logic, date arithmetic, and consideration of different month lengths and year transitions.",

In Prolog, we can utilize rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions and find the corresponding date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for operations that subtract months from dates.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. Check if the current month is January, in which case the year should also be decremented by 1.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from June 19, 2019, should result in May 19, 2019.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - When subtracting months, the day might change due to different month lengths. Implement a rule to handle this overflow, resetting the day to the maximum day of the resulting month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly during leap years. February should be adjusted to have 29 days when subtracting months.\n\n5. **Recursive Month Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-month subtraction rule repeatedly, until the desired number of months has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct application of rules for month and day adjustments during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure the program correctly handles month subtractions.\n   - Verify that the date a month ago is accurately calculated, such as subtracting one month from May 31, 2019, which should result in April 30, 2019.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in constructing a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date one month prior to a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, considering that today's date is correctly identified as June 19, 2019, which contradicts Jane's belief that it's June 18, 2019. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate June 26, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date one week ahead from the current date, which is known to be June 19, 2019. The main consideration is understanding how days progress into the future, including handling the end of the month and ensuring the correct date is reached. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage this date calculation, accounting for the number of days in each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for operations that add days to the current date.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the date one day ahead. The function should consider the number of days in each month and adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses the `increment_date` function to add multiple days. This function should recursively call `increment_date` the specified number of times and return the final date.\n\n4. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle the transition between different months, considering the varying days in each month. For instance, the transition from June (30 days) to July (31 days) should be considered.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's 29 days during leap years, ensuring accurate date calculations.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Recursion:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the correct path when incrementing dates and applying the appropriate month transition rules.\n   - Employ recursion to repeatedly increment the date by one day until the desired number of days (in this case, 7 days) is reached.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including transitions within the same month and across different months, both in leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the function correctly handles adding 7 days to June 19, 2019, resulting in June 26, 2019.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate dates in the future, accounting for different month lengths and leap years.

We need to calculate the date and time 24 hours after June 19, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the current date and time. However, we need to ensure that the correct current date, June 19, 2019, is used as the starting point. The logic required is to handle the addition of time, in this case, 24 hours, and ensure it does not overflow into the next day. In Prolog, we can implement this by defining rules for handling time and applying them recursively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent both date and time.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic addition and subtraction operations for time arithmetic.\n\n2. **Add Time Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_time(datetime(T), NewTime)` that adds 1 hour to the provided datetime structure. This function should handle the transition to the next day if the time exceeds 24 hours.\n\n3. **Recursive Time Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the `add_time` function to add a total of 24 hours to the initial datetime.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_time` function to reset the time components (hours, minutes, seconds) to the start of the next day if the day overflows due to time addition.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the functionality of the `add_time` function, especially around the transition to the next day. For example, adding 24 hours to June 19, 2019, at various times should result in June 20, 2019.\n\n6. **User Input and Handling:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and time, ensuring that the correct date (June 19, 2019) is used as the starting point.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can add a specified amount of time (in this case, 24 hours) to a given date and time, handling potential day overflows correctly.

For example, incrementing the date May 6, 2002, by one day should result in May 7, 2002.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane feels like May 6, 1992, was just yesterday, but in reality, it was ten years ago. The task is to determine the date one month prior to this ten-year-old date. To find this date, we need to subtract one month from May 6, 1992, which will involve transitioning from one month to another and adjusting the year accordingly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires subtracting a month from a given date, which involves handling transitions between months and potentially years. We need a logic that understands the number of days in each month and adjusts the date components (month, day, and year) appropriately. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and use recursive functions along with pattern matching to apply them correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. This structure should support arithmetic operations for date manipulation.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function that subtracts one month from a given date. This function should handle the transition between months and adjust the day accordingly if the month has fewer days than the original day.\n\n3. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition from one year to another when subtracting months. For example, going from January 31, 1992, to December 31, 1991.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's variable length when subtracting months. This will ensure the correct adjustment during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly applies the single-month subtraction function until the desired number of months is subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path through different rules and transitions when subtracting months.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between months within the same year and across year boundaries, including leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date one month prior to a given date, accounting for different month lengths, year transitions, and leap years.

The task is to determine the date one year prior to today. This involves a straightforward decrement of the year by one while keeping the month and day unchanged.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a simple decrement of the year component of the date while maintaining the month and day. There are no complex transitions across months or days to consider. However, we should ensure that the year decrement handles negative values correctly. In Prolog, this can be achieved using basic arithmetic operations on the year component.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. Note that this structure does not require any special handling of days or months for this specific problem.\n\n2. **Decrement Year Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that decrements the year (`YYYY`) by 1. For example, if today's date is `date(05, 06, 2002)`, then one year ago would be `date(05, 06, 2001)`.\n\n3. **Handling Negative Years:**\n   - Ensure that the year component is handled correctly when it goes below 0. This may involve checking if the year is already at the beginning of the negative or adding a constant to adjust the year and then performing the decrement.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly required for this task, include a leap year check in the code for potential future applications of the date manipulation rules.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the year is correctly decremented while keeping the month and day unchanged. Test with both positive and negative starting years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to implement a simple Prolog program that can determine the date one year prior to a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane considers May 6, 1992, to be like yesterday, but in reality, it was ten years ago. Today's date is May 6, 2002, and the task is to determine the date one week from today. This involves a simple increment of seven days from the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a straightforward addition of seven days to the current date, which falls within the same month and year. There are no special transitions to consider, but a general approach should account for such scenarios. In Prolog, this can be handled using date manipulation functions and rules that cover basic date arithmetic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle normal day increments and account for month and year transitions if needed.\n\n3. **Handling Regular Day Increment:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by the specified number of days. If the day reaches the end of the month, it should reset to the first day of the next month.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include rules to handle transitions to the next month or year when adding days. For instance, if the month is December and the day reaches 31, the year should be incremented, and the month should reset to January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and should be considered in date calculations.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rules for date transitions when adding days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover normal day increments within a month, month transitions, year transitions, and leap year scenarios.\n   - Verify that the `increment_date` function correctly handles different situations.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can handle basic date arithmetic, including adding a specified number of days to a given date.

In Prolog, this can be achieved using date manipulation functions and a simple rule for day subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For instance, decreasing December 24, 1937, should result in December 23, 1937.\n\n3. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Ensure that the day decrement does not go below 1. If it does, reset the day to the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific date, include a general rule to handle leap years, which affect the day count in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - While a simple decrement suffices for this problem, implement recursive rules for more complex scenarios where multiple days need to be subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for decrementing the day based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for day decrements within the same month and verify that the program handles dates near month boundaries correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that determines the date of the previous day, accounting for boundaries between days within a month and handling leap years. This straightforward logic can be extended to handle more complex date manipulations if needed.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from today, given that today is Christmas Eve of 1937. Christmas Eve falls on December 24, 1937. To find the date 10 days prior, we need to subtract 10 days from this date, considering transitions between days and months.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a historical date by subtracting a certain number of days from a given date. It requires handling transitions between days, months, and potentially years when subtracting days. In this case, subtracting 10 days from December might lead us back to November. Prolog can be used to define rules that manage these transitions and perform accurate date calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support date arithmetic operations, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date. This function should handle the transition between days within a month and roll over to the previous month if needed.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions to previous months and years when subtracting days. For example, if we subtract days from December, the month should change to November, and if needed, the year should decrement accordingly.\n\n4. **Handling November's Days:**\n   - Ensure the correct handling of days in November, as this month has 30 days. Subtracting days beyond November 30 should transition to October with the appropriate year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's days accurately during leap years when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that applies the single-day subtraction function repeatedly until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules based on the date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting days across month boundaries, year boundaries, and during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date 10 days ago from a given date, accounting for different month lengths, year transitions, and leap years.

For example, if the date is December 31, subtract one day to reach December 30.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February dates correctly.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive mechanism within `subtract_days` to subtract multiple days by repeatedly subtracting one day until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the appropriate transition rules based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting days within the same month, crossing month boundaries, and handling leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly subtracts seven days from December 24, 1937, resulting in December 17, 1937.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date one week prior to a given date. This involves implementing date arithmetic, handling transitions, and leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the input date.",

A palindrome number is one that reads the same forwards and backwards.

The challenge lies in identifying the dates that have numerical symmetry in their MM/DD/YYYY representation.

The next such date will be in 2040. The task is to determine the date for tomorrow based on today's palindrome date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment today's date by one day while keeping the same month and year. This is a straightforward date calculation that does not involve any month or year transitions. The key is to understand that the day component is incremented by 1. In Prolog, this can be achieved using a simple rule for incrementing the day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for basic arithmetic operations to increment the day.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 while keeping the month (`MM`) and year (`YYYY`) the same. For example, if today is 05/05/2020, then tomorrow should be 05/06/2020.\n\n3. **Month and Year Preservation:**\n   - Ensure that the rules focus on incrementing the day while preserving the month and year values.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Leap years do not affect the logic for this specific problem, but including a leap year check could be beneficial for future adaptations of the program.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's search capabilities are not extensively needed for this simple date calculation. The straightforward nature of the problem allows for a direct application of the increment rule.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various dates, especially around month boundaries and leap years, to ensure that the day is correctly incremented while the month and year remain unchanged.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that increments the date by one day while maintaining the same month and year.

In Prolog, we can use number manipulation and search capabilities to identify the previous palindrome date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a numerical representation for dates, such as `DDMMYYYY` to match the palindrome format.\n   - This representation allows for easy comparisons and calculations involving date digits.\n\n2. **Palindrome Date Detection:**\n   - Write a predicate `is_palindrome_date(DDMMYYYY)` that checks if a given number is a palindrome date in the current year (2020).\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in predicates for comparing and manipulating numbers.\n\n3. **Search for Previous Palindrome:**\n   - Use Prolog's search capabilities to find the previous palindrome date by iterating backwards from the current palindrome date.\n   - Start with the current date and repeatedly subtract one day until a palindrome date is found.\n\n4. **Date Format Conversion:**\n   - Convert the numerical palindrome date into the desired MM/DD/YYYY format using a conversion function.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Account for leap year by ensuring that February is treated as having 29 days during the search for the previous palindrome.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search and backtracking capabilities to explore different dates and identify the previous palindrome date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the palindrome date detection and conversion functions with various dates, including those in the first half of the year and the second half.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that identifies palindrome dates and calculates the date a month prior to a given palindrome date in 2020.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nToday is a palindrome day in the year 2020, meaning that the date in the MM/DD/YYYY format reads the same forwards and backwards. Considering today's date is 08/08/2020, one week from today would fall on 08/15/2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the date exactly one week from today. Today's special characteristic, being a palindrome date, does not change the fundamental logic of the calculation. We still need to increment today's date by 7 days while handling transitions across months and potentially years. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date arithmetic, ensuring that we cover all scenarios, including month boundaries and leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a clear and concise structure, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that this structure allows for arithmetic operations to facilitate date calculations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function, `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)`, which adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle transitions between days, months, and years, ensuring that the correct date is returned even when crossing boundaries.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement specific rules within the `increment_date` function to manage transitions to the next month and year when the days exceed the days in the current month.\n   - Account for different month lengths and the special case of December, which leads to a new year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Write a predicate to determine leap years, as this affects the number of days in February and thus can impact date calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Date Calculation:**\n   - Use recursion within the `increment_date` function to add days iteratively. This allows for flexibility in adding any number of days, not just one week.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules and navigate through different date transitions.\n   - Ensure that the search efficiently finds the correct path, especially when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include diverse test cases to validate the `increment_date` function, such as normal day increments, month transitions, year transitions, and leap year scenarios.\n   - Verify that the function handles dates like 08/08/2020 correctly, ensuring that one week from this palindrome date is indeed 08/15/2020.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate dates in the future, accounting for various date transitions and special cases, such as leap years. This functionality can be valuable for creating applications involving date-based calculations and checks.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that today is the last day of the year 1899. As the provided information suggests, this is a transition from the last day of December 1899 to the first day of January 1900. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be January 1, 1900.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a special case where the current date is the last day of a year, and the next day will be the first day of the following year. We need to handle this year-end transition effectively. In Prolog, we can accomplish this by implementing rules that account for such scenarios and using date manipulation functions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle year transitions, especially from December to January.\n\n2. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a specific rule to handle the transition from December 31st of a year to January 1st of the following year. This rule should increment the year when the day transitions from December 31st.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule for normal day increments, where the day is incremented by 1 within the same month.\n\n4. **Month and Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to handle different months and the number of days in each month. Also, handle leap years to account for the special case of February having 29 days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle consecutive day increments, where the rule for normal day increments is applied repeatedly until reaching the target date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the year-end transition and apply the special rule accordingly.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the year-end transition rule extensively, including cases before and after the transition. Also, include tests for normal day increments and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can handle year-end transitions and determine the date for tomorrow, considering both regular day increments and the unique scenario of transitioning from the last day of a year to the first day of the next year.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of yesterday, given that today is the last day of the year 1899. As December has 31 days, yesterday was December 30, 1899. The desired date format is MM/DD/YYYY, which represents the month, day, and four-digit year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward decrement of one day from the current date. The key consideration is understanding the number of days in each month to accurately determine the date of the previous day. In this case, we need to go back one day from the last day of December, which is straightforward without any month or year transitions. In Prolog, this can be achieved using date manipulation functions and a basic understanding of the number of days in each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function called `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that decreases the day component by one. If the day is the first of the month, set it to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Month and Day Adjustment:**\n   - Write rules to handle the adjustment of the day and month when decrementing. For example, decrementing December 31 should result in December 30.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if the year is a leap year, which would affect the number of days in February. However, this is not relevant for the current date.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use a recursive function to handle the decrement of multiple days. In this case, a single day decrement function would suffice, but the recursive approach makes the code more versatile.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's pattern matching can be used to apply the correct rules based on the current date and decrement direction.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `decrement_day` function for various dates, including the last day of months and the last day of the year.\n   - Verify that the function correctly handles the decrement and adjusts the day and month accordingly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of yesterday based on the last day of a given year, accounting for different days in each month and potential leap years.

Subtracting one year should decrement the year and adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, as leap years have an extra day in February that needs to be accounted for when subtracting years.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules and Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to handle the year subtraction and find the correct resulting date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the year subtraction with various starting dates, including the last day of the year, middle of the year, and beginning of the year.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles both leap years and common years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date one year prior to a given date, especially handling the transition from the last day of one year to the first day of the previous year. This will involve understanding year boundaries and applying the correct rules for date manipulation.",

Since there are 31 days in December 1899, the date one week ago would be December 24, 1899. This can be represented as 12/24/1899 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one week prior to the last day of 1899.

We need to handle the transition between months and ensure that the correct date is determined, especially when the month has fewer than 30 days. In this scenario, subtracting around 30 days from June would take us back to May. Prolog can assist in solving this problem by providing rules for decrementing days and handling month transitions, accounting for different month lengths.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations for decrementing days and months.\n\n2. **Decrement Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the date's day is not the first of the month, subtracting one day should decrement the day value.\n\n3. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This rule should consider the number of days in each month and adjust the month and day values accordingly.\n   - For example, going one month back from June 2, 1943, should lead to May 2, 1943.\n\n4. **Special Cases:**\n   - Handle the special case of February, which has fewer days, by checking if the year is a leap year and adjusting the end date of February accordingly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Month Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day decrement rule until reaching the desired date.\n   - The rule should decrement the month and adjust the day and year values as necessary.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's date range correctly.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules for month transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those that require crossing month boundaries, like going one month back from March 31st.\n   - Verify the program's behavior for February dates, both in leap and non-leap years.\n\n9. **Date Calculation for One Month Ago:**\n   - Apply the recursive logic to find the date one month ago from the given date of June 2, 1943.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one month ago from a given date, accounting for different month lengths and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, assuming the concert was originally scheduled for June 1, 1943, but was delayed by one day. To find this date, we need to calculate seven days prior to the current date, which is June 2, 1943 (one day after the scheduled date).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting a specific number of days (7 days) from a given date. It requires handling date arithmetic, including potential transitions between months and years. In this scenario, subtracting seven days from June 2, 1943, would involve crossing over into the previous month of May. We'll need to account for these transitions accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structured format, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY form.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations to facilitate date calculations.\n\n2. **Decrementing Days:**\n   - Write a rule to decrement a single day from a given date. If the date is not the first of the month, the rule should adjust the day and month accordingly.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 2, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when decrementing days. This involves knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day appropriately.\n   - Account for February's varying length in leap and non-leap years.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day decrement rule repeatedly, incrementing the count until it reaches seven.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of a week's worth of days, even across multiple months or years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, impacting the number of days in February and requiring adjustment.\n\n6. **Using Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions during the decrementing process.\n   - Ensure the recursive logic follows the correct path to accurately compute the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates spanning month and year boundaries, such as subtracting a week from June 1st and from February 28th in both leap and non-leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate the Date One Week Ago:**\n   - Apply the recursive logic to find the date seven days prior to June 2, 1943, which represents today's delayed concert date.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date one week ago from the given concert date, accounting for day, month, and year transitions, as well as leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the originally scheduled concert date of June 1, 1943, which was delayed by one day. To find this date, we need to add 24 hours to the current date, accounting for the one-day delay.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date by adding 24 hours to the given date while considering a one-day delay. This requires understanding time increments and handling the transition between days accurately. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by implementing rules for time arithmetic and considering the impact of the delay.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)` to represent both dates and times.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle time arithmetic operations accurately.\n\n2. **Handle One-Day Delay:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the one-day delay by incrementing the day by 1 if the current day is June 1, 1943.\n\n3. **Time Addition Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_time(datetime(T1), Hours, datetime(T2))` that adds the specified hours to a given datetime, considering the one-day delay rule.\n\n4. **Leap Year and Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle leap years and month transitions when adding time. For instance, if the time crosses over into July, the year should be incremented.\n\n5. **Recursive Time Addition:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly add hours until the target time is reached (24 hours in this case).\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and backtracking to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules, considering the one-day delay.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as time additions that cross day boundaries, month boundaries, and leap year boundaries.\n   - Verify that the one-day delay is correctly applied when needed.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date and time 24 hours after the original concert date, accounting for the one-day delay.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to calculate the date and time 24 hours after Tuesday, July 9, 1972.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the given date. We need to determine how this addition affects the day, month, and year components of the date.

In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining a rule that subtracts a day and considering boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `time(HH, MM, date(MM, DD, YYYY))` to represent the time of day and the current date.\n   - The `date` part of the structure should be able to handle day decrements.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that subtracts one day from the current date. For example, if the current date is May 4, then yesterday was May 3.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component doesn't go below 1 when decrementing. If it does, reset the day to the last day of the month and keep the month and year unchanged.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February's day count accurately during leap years.\n\n5. **Simple Time Representation:**\n   - As the time of day is not changing, a simple representation like `time(HH, MM)` should suffice for this problem.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s rule application and pattern matching to apply the day decrement rule correctly.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the decrement rule with various dates, including dates near month and year boundaries, and during leap years, to ensure the correctness of the logic.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that determines yesterday's date based on the given current date and time. This will involve a simple decrement operation and ensuring that the date remains accurate after the subtraction.",

The challenge lies in determining the exact number of days to subtract while considering partial days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, considering the current time as 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004. To find the date of one week ago, we need to calculate seven days back from today's date. This involves understanding how time and day boundaries should be handled when performing this calculation.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a careful consideration of time and date transitions. Since we are dealing with a specific time of the day (3:02 pm), we need to ensure that the date calculation takes this time into account. In Prolog, we can manage this by defining rules that handle time and date arithmetic, adjusting for day and month boundaries as needed.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Time and Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `time(HH, MM)` to represent the time of the day and another structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - These structures should work in tandem to handle time and date calculations.\n\n2. **Handling Time Subtraction:**\n   - Write rules to handle the subtraction of hours and minutes from the current time. This will involve adjusting the time and considering the transition to the previous day if the time goes below zero.\n\n3. **Date Subtraction:**\n   - Develop rules to subtract days from the current date, considering month and year transitions. This is similar to the date calculation in previous examples but now takes into account the time of day.\n\n4. **Coordinating Time and Date Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the time and date calculations work together seamlessly. If the time subtraction goes below zero, it should trigger the date subtraction, and vice versa.\n\n5. **Leap Year and Month Lengths:**\n   - Implement logic to handle leap years and different month lengths, which will be crucial when subtracting days across these boundaries.\n\n6. **Recursive Time and Date Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to subtract the required time and days to find the date one week ago. This will involve repeated applications of the time and date subtraction rules.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to manage the complex transitions involved in time and date arithmetic.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios, such as transitions across month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap years, ensuring that both time and date are considered.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create an intricate Prolog program that accounts for both time and date transitions when calculating the date one week ago from a given time and date.

To find the date one week ahead, we need to calculate the date and time seven days from the current time. Since a week has seven days, this will involve incrementing the day component by seven, while also considering the month and year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires handling both day and time increments, which involves understanding the transitions between days, months, and years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the current local time, which is 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004. Since we are only adding 24 hours, the month and year will remain the same, and we need to calculate the date for the same time (3:02 pm) on the next day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple addition of 24 hours to the current time and determining the corresponding date. Since the month and year do not change, the main focus is on calculating the correct time 24 hours later and then determining the date based on that time. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for time arithmetic and associating specific times with their corresponding dates.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Time and Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `time(HH, MM)` to represent the time of day in hours and minutes.\n   - Use another structure, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent dates.\n\n2. **Convert Time to Hours:**\n   - Write a function to convert the minutes and hours of a time into the total hours since midnight (e.g., 3:02 pm would be 15:02 converted to 15.0333 hours).\n\n3. **Add Hours Function:**\n   - Implement a function that adds a specified number of hours to a given time. This function should handle the conversion back from hours to the time format (HH:MM).\n\n4. **Associate Time with Date:**\n   - Define a mapping or rules that associate specific times (HH:MM) with their corresponding dates. For example, 15:02 on May 4, 2004, should be associated with the date 05/04/2004.\n\n5. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Consider any special cases, such as the transition from 23:59 to 00:00 and the associated date change.\n\n6. **Leap Year and Daylight Saving Time:**\n   - Discuss the assumptions and limitations regarding leap years and daylight saving time. Determine whether any adjustments are necessary for the given scenario.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to add 24 hours to the current time and find the corresponding date using the time-to-date mapping.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to manage the time addition and date association.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different times of the day and verify the correct date is produced after adding 24 hours.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date 24 hours later based on the current time. This will involve time arithmetic and associating times with their respective dates, while also considering any necessary adjustments for time transitions.",

Therefore, the date tomorrow will be March 3, 1966.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple increment of the day within the same month and year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to today, given that today is the second day of the third month of 1966. To find this date, we need to understand the number of days in each month and subtract the appropriate number of days to go back exactly one month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting a month from the current date. We need to handle the transition from one month to another without crossing into the previous year. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules that manage month decrements and applying them correctly based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations that decrement months.\n\n2. **Handling Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one month from the current date. This rule should consider the number of days in the current month and decrement the month accordingly. If the current day exceeds the days in the previous month, it should also adjust the day and potentially the year.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement specific logic to handle transitions between months, ensuring that the year remains accurate when crossing from March (third month) back to February.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, as this affects the number of days in February. Subtracting one month from a leap year February may require special handling.\n\n5. **Recursive Month Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that subtracts one month repeatedly until reaching the desired date. This will handle cases where the current date is further in the future.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rules based on the current date and month configuration.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different month transitions, both within the same year and across years, including leap years. For example, test the transition from March 2 to February 28 in a non-leap year and to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a clear and user-friendly prompt that guides users to input a date and receive the date from one month ago.\n\nThe code prompt will assist the user in crafting a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one month prior to a given date.

Given that today is the second day of the third month of 1966, the date one year ago would have been the second day of the third month of 1965.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward decrement of the year by one while keeping the month and day unchanged. The logic required is similar to incrementing or decrementing days within a month that we've seen in previous examples. The main difference here is that we need to adjust the year instead of the month or day. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining a rule that specifically targets year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy manipulation of years, months, and days.\n\n2. **Decrement Year Function:**\n   - Implement a function called `decrement_year` that decreases the year by one while keeping the month and day unchanged. For example, if the input date is `date(3, 2, 1966)`, the output should be `date(3, 2, 1965)`.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Although not required for this specific case, include rules that handle transitions for the month and day in case of special scenarios. These rules would handle situations where the chosen date is not within the valid range of the month (e.g., setting the day to the last valid day of the month).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, as this can affect the number of days in February and thus potentially impact the date one year ago.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and pattern matching to create a rule that finds the date one year ago. The rule should repeatedly call `decrement_year` until the desired year is reached.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `decrement_year` function and the one-year-ago calculation for different starting dates, including boundaries like February in leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one year ago from a given date.

This means that today's date is March 2, 1966.

In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle these transitions and subtract the required number of days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between days, months, and years when subtracting days.\n\n3. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Define a rule within the function to subtract one day at a time, considering the end of the month. If the current day is not the first day of the month, subtracting a day should decrement the day count. If it reaches the beginning of the month, it should decrement the month and reset the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement specific rules to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, if `DD` is 1, subtracting a day should increment the previous month and set `DD` to the last day of that month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is the second day of the third month of the year 1966. This means that today's date is March 2, 1966. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate March 9, 1966.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward calculation of adding seven days to the current date. Since this addition does not cross any month or year boundaries, the focus is on incrementing the days within the same month and year. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for date arithmetic, ensuring that the day component does not exceed the days in the current month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for basic arithmetic operations to add days.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the normal day increment within the same month.\n\n3. **Month Days Limit:**\n   - Implement a check to ensure the day does not exceed the number of days in the current month. If the day exceeds this limit, carry over the extra days to the next month.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month reaches December and the days are incremented further.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific date calculation, include a rule to check for leap years to handle February dates in general cases.\n\n6. **Recursive Date Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that calls `increment_date` repeatedly to add multiple days. This function should be able to calculate the date one week (7 days) from the given date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date transitions when adding days.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that verify the functionality of the date addition across different months and years, including cases where the days spill over into the next month.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week from today, accounting for days, months, and years.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to determine the date that follows today's date by one day in the year 1966.

The main challenge lies in handling the transition between days, especially when moving from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month. Prolog's capabilities can be used to define rules and handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent specific dates.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations to facilitate day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 for any day that is not the last day of its respective month. For instance, the second day of the third month would become the third day of the third month when incremented by one day.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Define a rule to handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month.

        "question": "Today is 9/7. Jane is watching NFL 2003. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date for tomorrow, knowing that today is September 7 of an unspecified year, while Jane is watching NFL 2003. Since the context mentions NFL 2003, we can deduce that today's date is September 7, 2003. Therefore, the date for tomorrow will be September 8, 2003.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the next day's date, which requires understanding day transitions and handling the end of the month. The year 2003 is confirmed from the context, so the primary task is to increment the day from September 7 to September 8. This is a straightforward date calculation that doesn't involve complex transitions. In Prolog, this can be achieved using date manipulation rules.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure supports basic day increment operations.\n\n2. **Day Increment Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that increments the day by one, e.g., from September 7 to September 8.\n   - This function should handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month, especially in September, which has 30 days.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, as this affects the number of days in February and thus could impact following months.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although a simple increment is required in this case, implement recursive rules that can handle any number of day increments. This will cover scenarios where larger increments are needed.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for incrementing the day and handling month transitions.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions, such as from September 7 to September 8, and for month-end transitions, like August 31 to September 1.\n   - Test the leap year handling by verifying the correct date transitions in February of a leap year.\n\n7. **User Input and Context:**\n   - Consider how the user's input of a partial date (only month and day) can be handled gracefully. The program should infer the current year based on context, as done with NFL 2003 in this case.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine tomorrow's date based on a given partial date, handling day increments and month transitions, and being aware of leap years. This will provide a practical solution for real-world date calculations.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one year prior to today, considering today's date as September 7th. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from today's date. This involves understanding year transitions and ensuring the correct year is subtracted while maintaining the month and day intact.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires performing date arithmetic, specifically subtracting one year, while accounting for the rolling over of the year boundary. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle this year transition and ensure the correct date is calculated. The key is to isolate the year component and decrement it while preserving the month and day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy manipulation of individual date components (month, day, and year).\n\n2. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one year from a given date. This rule should focus on decrementing the `YYYY` component while keeping the `MM` and `DD` components unchanged.\n\n3. **Handling Special Cases:**\n   - Implement specific logic to handle cases where the resulting date falls in the previous year. For example, if the current date is September 7, 2003, subtracting one year should result in September 7, 2002.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, as they affect the number of days in a year and may impact the calculation.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Although year subtraction is a simple arithmetic operation, use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and pattern matching to handle the year transition and any special cases.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different years, including leap years, to ensure the year subtraction rule is working correctly. For example, verify that subtracting one year from September 7, 2003, yields September 7, 2002.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a prompt that allows users to input a date in the MM/DD format and receives the date from one year ago, handling any necessary validations or edge cases.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in constructing a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date one year prior to a given date, considering year transitions and potential special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the current date, which is stated as 9/7, likely referring to September 7. We need to calculate the date and time 24 hours in the future from this current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves basic date arithmetic, adding 24 hours to the given date. The main consideration is understanding the boundaries of days and ensuring the correct transition to the next day, especially when crossing midnight. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for day increments and handling the transition between days, months, and years if needed.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for straightforward arithmetic operations on the day component.\n\n2. **Day Increment Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to a given date. This function should handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February and should be considered when adding days.\n\n4. **Adding 24 Hours:**\n   - Calculate the date 24 hours later by calling the `increment_day` function four times, as 24 hours is equivalent to four days.\n\n5. **Handling Midnight Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the code accounts for transitions across midnight, such as from September 7 to September 8.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly apply the day increment function until the desired number of hours (24) has been reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Let Prolog's pattern matching determine whether a transition to the next month or year is needed when incrementing the date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correctness of the `increment_day` function, especially around month-end and year-end transitions.\n   - Test the function with both normal days and days leading up to midnight transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates the date 24 hours in the future from a given date.

Therefore, the date for tomorrow will be January 2, 1930.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves handling a specific month-end transition from December 31 to January 1. The key is to identify this scenario and increment the date accordingly. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage this transition and other general day increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle both regular day increments and special transitions like the one from December 31 to January 1.\n\n2. **Base Case for Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that specifically handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. When `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should change the month to January (`MM` becomes 1) and increment the day to 1.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 for any other scenario, handling the regular day-to-day transition.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between different months and the transition from December to January, which involves changing both the month and year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly relevant for this specific scenario, include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, as this affects February dates.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle consecutive day increments, ensuring that the correct transition rules are applied.\n\n7. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the correct rule based on the current date. Pattern matching will help identify the scenario where a transition to January 1 needs to occur.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the base case for the December 31 to January 1 transition, as well as normal day increments across different months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can determine the date for tomorrow, accounting for the month-end transition from December to January.

We need to account for this transition when calculating the date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a specific number of days in the past from a given date, especially when the target date falls in the previous month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. As December only has 31 days, the date couldn't have been 12/32/1929. Today, therefore, is January 1, 1930. One week prior to this would be the 4th of January, represented as 01/04/1930.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one week prior to the current date, which happens to be January 1, 1930. We need a logic that can handle the transition from December to January and subtract seven days accurately. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date arithmetic, accounting for different month lengths and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Date Representation:**\n   - Use a `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure to represent dates, enabling arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Handling Day Decrease:**\n   - Craft a rule to decrement the day component, considering month boundaries. If the day is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the preceding month, and the month should decrement accordingly.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to manage the transition from December to January when subtracting days. This involves recognizing when the year should be decremented.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly subtracts one day until reaching zero days. This will handle the week subtraction accurately.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Integrate a mechanism to identify leap years, which is vital for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Prolog Search Application:**\n   - Employ Prolog's pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date's structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Include tests that validate the subtraction across month boundaries, year transitions, and during leap years to ensure the accuracy of the calculated dates.\n\nThe code prompt will assist the user in crafting a Prolog program that determines the date one week ago from a specified date, accounting for intricate transitions between days, months, and years, as well as leap years.

This requires understanding the number of days in each month and ensuring a smooth transition between them. In Prolog, we can implement rules to handle this monthly transition and perform date arithmetic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for basic arithmetic operations on days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 for any day that is not the last day of the month. For instance, if `MM` is 1 (January) and `DD` is 1, the next date should be January 2, 1930.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition when the day reaches the last day of the month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. As December only has 31 days, today is necessarily January 1, 1930. We must therefore determine the date 24 hours after the start of January 1, 1930.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward transition of 24 hours from a given date. The key consideration is handling the transition from one day to the next, which does not cross any month or year boundaries in this case. In Prolog, we can implement a simple rule to increment the day while keeping the month and year intact.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure allows for easy manipulation of individual date components.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to a given date. The function should increment the day (`DD`) while keeping the month (`MM`) and year (`YYYY`) the same.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Include a condition in the `increment_day` function to reset the day to the first of the month if it exceeds the number of days in that month (e.g., reset to January 1 if the day becomes January 32).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Leap years do not affect the current scenario, but including a general leap year check could be beneficial for future calculations. Implement a rule to identify leap years.\n\n5. **Simple Date Transition:**\n   - Unlike previous examples, this scenario does not involve month or year transitions. The focus is on a straightforward day increment.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Prolog's search capabilities are not extensively needed for this simple transition. The `increment_day` function can be applied deterministically.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the `increment_day` function, ensuring it handles normal day increments and day overflows into the next month.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that increments a given date by 24 hours while accounting for day overflows into the next month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date for today, given that the day before yesterday (two days ago) was November 23, 1933. To find today's date, we need to add two days to November 23, 1933. This addition should consider month and year boundaries to ensure the correct date is calculated.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple addition of two days to a given date, but it requires handling transitions across months and years. In Prolog, we can define rules and use recursive logic to manage these transitions effectively. We need to determine how the addition of days spills over into subsequent months and years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for basic arithmetic operations like adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - Handle day overflows into subsequent months or years by adjusting the month and year accordingly.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement specific rules to handle transitions when adding days. For example, if adding days reaches January 1, the year should be incremented.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly during leap years when adding days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `add_days` function to add one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month and year transitions when adding days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that involve adding days across different months and years, including leap years, to ensure the correctness of the function.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates today's date based on the given information about the day before yesterday. This will involve implementing date addition with awareness of month and year boundaries, making it a practical tool for handling date-related problems.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from the day before yesterday, which was November 23, 1933. To find this date, we need to subtract another two days from the starting date and then subtract 10 days from the resulting date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a series of date calculations: first, subtracting two days and then subtracting ten days.

In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage these transitions and use recursive functions along with Prolog's search capabilities to find the correct dates.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for day subtraction and addition.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction and Addition Functions:**\n   - Write functions to subtract and add a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - These functions should handle transitions between days, months, and years, ensuring that the correct date is calculated even when crossing these boundaries.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting or adding days. For instance, if the date is December 31 and we subtract one day, the result should be January 1 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly manage February dates during leap years when subtracting or adding days.\n\n5. **Recursive Date Calculation:**\n   - Develop recursive functions that apply the day subtraction and addition functions repeatedly to calculate dates a specified number of days in the past or future.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to determine the appropriate transitions and boundaries based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include various test cases to validate the functions, especially around month and year boundaries and during leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of multiple days, such as 10 days from November 23, 1933.\n\nThe code prompt will challenge the user to create a Prolog program that can compute dates a specified number of days ago or ahead, accounting for various date transitions and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that the day before yesterday was November 23, 1933. Based on this information, we can deduce that yesterday was November 24, 1933, and therefore, today is November 25, 1933. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward subtraction of seven days from a given date. However, we must ensure that the subtraction does not go beyond the beginning of the week or cross any month boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved by implementing rules for subtracting days and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day from a given date. If the day is 1, subtracting one day should result in the last day of the previous month, and the month should be incremented.\n\n3. **Subtract Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that subtracts seven days from a date. This rule will repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until reaching the desired date.\n\n4. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when subtracting days. For example, if November 1 is reached, the month should be set to October, and the day should remain at 31.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February during leap years when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Recursive Subtraction and Prolog Search:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and pattern matching to apply the correct rules during the subtraction process. The search functionality will help find the appropriate transitions and apply them accordingly.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting days across month boundaries and during leap years, to ensure the program's correctness.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date one week ago from a given date.

Determining the date for tomorrow requires an understanding of how days transition into one another, including the potential month transition from November to December.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date one day after US Thanksgiving in 2001. We need a solution that handles the transition from one day to the next, considering the end of November and the potential start of December. In Prolog, this can be approached by establishing rules for day increments and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Represent Dates:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format. This structure should be adaptable to arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Basic Day Increment:**\n   - Start by defining a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. If the day reaches the last day of the month, it should reset to 1 and increment the month (`MM`).\n\n3. **Special Cases for Months:**\n   - Handle December, the last month of the year, by resetting the year to the next one when transitioning from November to December.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which affects the number of days in February and could potentially impact the date calculation.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to another, accounting for month and year transitions.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Matching:**\n   - Leverage Prolog's search capabilities and pattern matching to automatically apply the appropriate rules based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different month transitions, including the transition from November to December, and handle leap years to ensure the program's correctness.\n\nThe code prompt, following this plan, will guide users in creating a Prolog program to determine tomorrow's date accurately, considering various date transitions and the special case of US Thanksgiving in 2001.

        "question": "In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from US Thanksgiving in the year 2001. As US Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday of November, we can deduce that today is November 22, 2001. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date based on a given date, which requires subtracting a certain number of days while considering month boundaries. In this case, we need to go back 10 days from November 22, 2001. Prolog can assist in solving this problem by providing rules for date arithmetic, including handling the transitions between days and months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for flexible date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - Handle the transition between days within the same month, ensuring that the day count doesn't go below 1.\n   - If the resulting date falls on the last day of a month, handle the transition to the previous month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, subtracting days from November should lead to October of the same year.\n   - Special care should be taken for December, where subtracting days might lead to November of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February when subtracting days. Leap years have 29 days in February, which will impact the date calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Use recursion in the `subtract_days` function to subtract the desired number of days. Subtract one day at a time until reaching the target number of days.\n\n6. **Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to match the appropriate rules for date transitions based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include comprehensive test cases that cover various scenarios, such as transitions between months and years, and leap years. For instance, subtracting 10 days from November 22, 2001, should give the correct date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates dates from a given date after subtracting a specified number of days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from US Thanksgiving in 2001. As US Thanksgiving falls on the fourth Thursday of November, and assuming today is that Thanksgiving day, the goal is to find the date one week later. This involves understanding the specific timing of Thanksgiving and then adding seven days to the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a two-step approach. First, we need to calculate the date of US Thanksgiving in the year 2001, and then we can add seven days to that date to find the one-week delay. In Prolog, we can implement rules to determine the Thanksgiving date based on the fourth Thursday of November, and then use date arithmetic to calculate the future date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. This structure should support date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Calculate Thanksgiving Date:**\n   - Write a rule to determine the date of Thanksgiving in a given year. This rule should find the fourth Thursday of November.\n   - Start by finding the first Thursday in November and then add three weeks to arrive at Thanksgiving.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date, handling transitions across months and years.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. For example, if the date is November 30, adding one day should change the date to December 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February dates correctly. Determine if the year is a leap year and adjust accordingly when adding days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `add_days` function to iteratively add days until the desired count is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to find the correct Thanksgiving date in 2001 and then apply the correct rules for adding days.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the Thanksgiving date calculation for different years.\n   - Verify the functionality of the `add_days` function across various scenarios, including month and year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that first calculates US Thanksgiving in 2001 and then finds the date one week later.

As mentioned in the previous prompts, US Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. Therefore, Thanksgiving in the year 2001 fell on November 22, 2001. We need to find the date 24 hours after this specific Thanksgiving date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a specific date in the past and then adding 24 hours to it. The challenge lies in determining the US Thanksgiving date for the year 2001 and ensuring the correct time increment is applied. In Prolog, we can define rules to calculate Thanksgiving and then use date manipulation functions to handle the time addition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use the `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure to represent dates, which allows for easy manipulation of months, days, and years.\n\n2. **Calculate US Thanksgiving:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the US Thanksgiving date for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date for today, knowing that the meeting has been rescheduled for 11 AM tomorrow, on October 16, 1924. To find today's date, we need to determine the previous day, considering the month and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date that is exactly one day prior to the given date, which happens to be in the past. We must handle transitions between days, months, and years to determine the correct date today. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date arithmetic and leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations to subtract days and handle various date transitions.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the previous day. If `DD` is not the first day of the month, decrement the day. If `DD` is 1, check for the previous month and decrement the month accordingly.\n\n3. **Handle Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the previous year. Subtracting one day from January 1 should correctly go to December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to handle February dates correctly. Determine whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that calls `decrement_day` repeatedly until the number of days reaches zero, indicating the correct previous date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the appropriate transitions and apply the correct rules for different scenarios, such as transitioning between months or years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various date transitions, such as moving from October 15 to October 14, from December 31 to January 1, and during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date for today, given a rescheduled meeting date for tomorrow.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date exactly one month prior to tomorrow's rescheduled meeting, which is set for October 16, 1924, at 11 AM. To find this date, we need to calculate the date that was a month ago from October 16, accounting for any transitions in months or years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date based on a known future date. We must subtract one month while handling transitions between months and potentially years. In this case, subtracting one month from October 16, 1924, would result in September 16, 1924. Prolog can assist in solving this by providing tools to manipulate dates and handle various transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a date structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should support operations for subtracting months.\n\n2. **Subtract One Month:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one month from a given date. If the date falls on the first day of the month, the rule should adjust the month and year accordingly.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months, ensuring that the correct month and year are reflected when subtracting a month.\n   - Account for cases where the starting date is in the first half of the month and subtracting a month goes back to the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle September and February dates during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-month subtraction rule repeatedly, until the desired number of months is subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct transition rules based on the given date.\n   - Ensure that the recursive subtraction process follows the correct path.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as transitions between months and years, and check if the program correctly handles leap years.\n   - Verify that the code can subtract multiple months accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate a date one month prior to a given date, considering all relevant transitions and special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from tomorrow's rescheduled meeting, which is set for 11 AM on October 16, 1924. To find this date, we need to calculate two days from now (accounting for the transition to the next day) and then add one week. This involves understanding day and week transitions and handling them accordingly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a two-step approach: first, calculate the date for tomorrow (October 17, 1924}, and then add seven days to arrive at the date one week from tomorrow. The key considerations are the transitions between days and weeks, ensuring that the correct dates are computed across these intervals. In Prolog, we can define rules for both day and week increments, handling any necessary adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates. This structure should support operations for both day and week increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the date for the following day. This function should handle regular day transitions and account for month boundaries, such as transitioning from December 31 to January 1.\n\n3. **Add Weeks Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_weeks(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Weeks, NewDate)` that increments the date by a specified number of weeks. This function should use the `increment_day` function to add seven days repeatedly until the desired number of weeks is reached.\n\n4. **Handling Week Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_weeks` function to handle the transition between days and weeks, ensuring that the correct date is computed.\n\n5. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include rules to handle transitions between months and years when adding weeks. Recognize that adding weeks across year boundaries might be required (e.g., from December to January).\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Write a function to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and requires special handling.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive functions for both day and week increments, ensuring that the correct transitions are made across multiple days and weeks.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules and transitions based on the current date and the desired time interval.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include various test cases to verify the correctness of the week calculation, especially around month and year boundaries and during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week from tomorrow, accounting for all necessary date and time transitions and special cases.

This rule should decrement the month while keeping the day and year intact, unless the date falls in January, in which case it should decrement the year as well.\n\n3. **Handling January Transition:**\n   - Implement a specific rule to handle the transition from January 31 to December 1, taking into account the change in the year.\n\n4. **Adjusting Days:**\n   - When subtracting a month, the day might exceed the number of days in the new month. Account for this by adjusting the day to the last day of the month if necessary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates correctly. This is crucial for accurately adjusting dates in the previous year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop recursive rules to facilitate the subtraction of approximately one month. This will involve repeated applications of the single-month subtraction rule.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities and backtracking to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules for the date transition.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, including those that require crossing month and year boundaries, to ensure the logic handles different scenarios, such as transitions between December and January.\n\nThe code prompt will assist the user in crafting a Prolog program that can determine the date approximately one month prior to a given date, accounting for transitions between months and years, and adjusting for days accordingly.",

When subtracting years and reaching a new decade, decrement the year by 10 and update the decade accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year and Day Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to ensure the correct handling of days in February.\n   - Adjust the day appropriately if it falls on a date that doesn't exist in the previous year (e.g., February 29 subtracting into a non-leap year).\n\n5. **Recursive Year Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly subtracts one year from the date until the desired number of years (five years, in this case) is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive capabilities to apply the year subtraction rule iteratively and find the correct solution.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the year subtraction across different years, including transitions into previous decades and leap years, to ensure the logic is correct.\n\nThe code prompt will assist the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date of yesterday's celebration of Jane and John's anniversary. This involves recursive year subtraction and handling various calendar-related transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nToday is the fifth anniversary of Jane and John's marriage, which occurred on January 2, 1958. As such, today's date is January 2, 1963. The task is to determine the date 10 days ago, which would provide the date of December 23, 1962.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a specific number of years (in this case, 5) and then adding a certain number of days (10) to that date. This requires understanding how years and days are added to a base date while handling month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date arithmetic, including year and day additions, to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for operations like year addition and day addition.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date. This function should consider the transition between decades and centuries, adjusting the year, month, and day accordingly.\n\n3. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to the given date, handling the transition between months and years if needed.\n\n4. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to add a specified number of days to a given date, using the `increment_day` function recursively.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the functions for adding years and days can handle transitions between months and years, accounting for different month lengths and the change from December to January.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February. This is crucial for accurately adding days to dates spanning February.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to apply the correct rules for adding years and days, especially across month and year boundaries.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the addition of years and days across different scenarios, such as adding 5 years and 10 days from January 1st, handling leap years, and adding years and days from other months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can perform date calculations involving year and day additions, handling various transitions and special cases.

The task is to determine the date 24 hours after this special day. Since there are 24 hours in one day, determining the date 24 hours later would mean extending today's date by one day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis scenario involves a straightforward increment of one day from a known date. However, we need to ensure that the logic handles the transition between days correctly, especially when crossing month and year boundaries. In this case, since the anniversary is in January, we don't expect any year transitions, but we should account for potential month transitions. In Prolog, we can implement a rule to handle day increments and ensure it works seamlessly across different months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be able to handle day increments and potential month transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. If the day reaches the end of the month, it should wrap around to the first day of the next month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year Transition Handling:**\n   - Although not required for this specific scenario, include a rule to handle the transition to the next year when January 31 becomes February 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Though not necessary for this case, include a rule to check for leap years, which would affect the number of days in February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although a simple increment is required here, implement a recursive rule for general cases that can handle multiple day increments. This will ensure the code can handle any number of days added to a given date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the increment rule across different months and years, including end-of-month and end-of-year transitions, as well as leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly increments dates like January 31 to February 1.\n\n9. **Anniversaries and Special Dates:**\n   - Consider including a function to check if a given date is a special anniversary date, such as a wedding anniversary, and offer a celebratory message in the output.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours after a given date, especially handling anniversaries and transitions between days, months, and years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane ran out of eggs today after starting with 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and eating one per day. We need to determine the date when this happened. Since Jane ate one egg every day, the number of eggs remaining is directly related to the number of days that have passed. We can deduce that today is May 16, 2017, as it takes exactly 7 days to finish 40 eggs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the current date based on a daily activity (eating one egg) and the starting date. The key is to understand the relationship between the number of days and the remaining eggs. We need to compute the date 7 days after May 9, 2017. This requires basic date arithmetic and an understanding of week transitions. In Prolog, this can be achieved using rules for date calculations and pattern matching to handle week boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Increment Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NumDays, NewDate)` that increments a given date by a specified number of days. This function should handle transitions across months and years.\n\n3. **Handling Week Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions from one week to another, considering that weeks start on Monday and end on Sunday.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in a year and thus the week transitions.\n\n5. **Recursive Date Calculation:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that takes a starting date and the number of days to increment. This function should repeatedly call `increment_days` until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the correct path and apply the appropriate rules for date transitions.\n   - Pattern matching should be used to handle the weekly transitions, especially when crossing Sunday boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the date calculation function with various starting dates and numbers of days to ensure it handles different scenarios, including month and year transitions, as well as leap years.\n\n8. **Finding the Target Date:**\n   - Use the recursive date calculation function to find the date 7 days after May 9, 2017, which is the date Jane ran out of eggs.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that determines the current date based on a starting date and a daily activity, accounting for week transitions and different years, including leap years.

        "question": "On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and today is the day she ran out of eggs, implying that she ate one egg per day for 40 days. We need to determine the date for tomorrow, which will be the 41st day after May 9, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and the number of days that have passed since then. Jane's egg consumption rate of one egg per day serves as a consistent interval. We need to determine the date 41 days after May 9, 2017, which requires understanding date arithmetic and potentially handling month and year transitions. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by implementing rules for date increments and applying them iteratively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support operations that add days to a given date.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle day, month, and year transitions correctly. For example, adding one day to May 31st would result in June 1st of the same year.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and thus the overall date calculation.\n\n4. **Base Case and Iteration:**\n   - Write a base case for the number of days added being zero, which returns the original date unchanged.\n   - Implement an iterative approach where the function calls itself recursively, decrementing the number of days to be added until it reaches zero.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and backtracking capabilities to find the correct path when adding days, especially across month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, across months, and into the next year, both in leap and non-leap years.\n\n7. **Finding the Date Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the starting date of May 9, 2017, and knowing Jane ate one egg per day, calculate the date 41 days later, which is tomorrow.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that simulates the date calculation based on a consistent interval of events (Jane eating one egg per day).

To find the date of yesterday, we need to calculate 40 days after May 9, 2017. This will help us determine when Jane ran out of eggs and, subsequently, the date of the previous day.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves calculating a past date based on a known starting date and the passage of a certain number of days.

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to determine when Jane had 10 eggs left, which would have been one week and three additional days after the initial purchase.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a specific date (10 days ago) based on a daily consumption pattern leading up to the present day. We need to determine the date when Jane had 10 eggs remaining, which requires understanding the incremental changes from one day to another and identifying when the egg count crossed the 10-egg threshold. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic and managing the egg count.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Egg Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date_egg(MM, DD, YYYY, Eggs)` to represent both the date and the remaining egg count.\n   - Initialize the egg count with 40 on May 9, 2017, i.e., `date_egg( 05, 09, 2017, 40)`.\n\n2. **Increment Date and Decrease Egg Count:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the date by one day and decreases the egg count by one, considering month and year transitions when the day increments.\n   - For example, going from May 9 to May 10 while decreasing the egg count to 39.\n\n3. **Handling Egg Count Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition when the egg count reaches a certain threshold, like 10 eggs remaining.

        "question": "On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and today she ran out of eggs after eating one per day. We need to find the date when Jane started eating eggs, which was a month ago. This involves calculating 30 days back from today, considering the month and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a past date based on a known present date and the concept of a fixed number of days passing (30 days for a month). We need to handle transitions between days, months, and potentially years when subtracting 30 days from the current date. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by employing date manipulation functions and recursive logic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should support operations like day subtraction and month transitions.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Implement a function to subtract a certain number of days (e.g., `subtract_days(Days, Date, NewDate)`) from a given date.\n   - Handle day subtraction across month boundaries, ensuring the correct month and day values are set when transitioning between months.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions to the previous month or year when subtracting days. For instance, if the starting date is in June, the function should know to transition to May, adjusting the month and year accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Develop a function to check if a year is a leap year, which affects the number of days in February and thus the month transitions.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a recursive function that calls the `subtract_days` function repeatedly until the number of days reaches zero. This will handle the bulk subtraction of days, including across multiple months or years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Backtracking:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and backtracking capabilities to find the correct path through the recursive subtraction, ensuring the proper application of month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the subtraction function with various scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and verify the correct date is calculated.\n   - Ensure the function handles leap years correctly by testing with dates spanning February of leap years.\n\n8. **Find the Date a Month Ago:**\n   - Given the current date (when Jane ran out of eggs), calculate the date 30 days ago using the recursive subtraction function.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine a past date based on the present date and the passage of a fixed number of days.

This can be achieved by using Prolog's capabilities to handle date arithmetic and transitions between dates.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for easy arithmetic operations on days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Increment/Decrement Date Functions:**\n   - Write functions to increment and decrement dates by a specified number of days, handling transitions between months and years.\n   - Ensure these functions handle leap years to correctly manage the days in February.\n\n3. **Leap Year Detection:**\n   - Implement a function to detect leap years to accurately handle the days in February during leap years.\n\n4. **Recursive Date Calculation:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that decrements the date by a specified number of days.

We need to determine the date seven days ago, considering Jane's egg consumption rate of one egg per day. This requires understanding date arithmetic and handling the daily transitions. In Prolog, we can implement rules for date calculations and then apply these rules based on the daily routine.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should allow for easy day-by-day calculations.\n\n2. **Increment and Decrement Dates:**\n   - Write rules to increment and decrement dates by one day. These rules should handle transitions between months and years gracefully.\n\n3. **Handling Daily Routine:**\n   - Implement a function that simulates the passage of time based on a daily routine, such as Jane eating one egg per day.\n   - This function should take a starting date and the number of days to simulate, returning the final date.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, as this affects the number of days in a year and thus Jane's egg consumption.\n\n5. **Recursive Time Passage:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the daily routine function repeatedly to simulate the passage of time. This will handle any given number of days, including transitions through months and years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date transitions and daily routines.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the daily routine function with various starting dates and numbers of days to cover different scenarios, including month and year transitions and leap years.\n   - Verify that the function works correctly when simulating a week of daily routines.\n\n8. **Find the Date One Week Ago:**\n   - Use the daily routine function to find the date seven days ago from today, considering Jane's egg consumption rate.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that models Jane's egg consumption and determines the date one week ago from today. This involves both date arithmetic and applying a daily routine over that period, demonstrating an understanding of recursive logic and date manipulation in Prolog.",

This involves calculating the duration of Jane's egg supply and then adding one week to the resulting date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the date one week ahead based on the starting date of May 9, 2017, and the daily consumption of eggs. We need to determine how long Jane's egg supply lasted and then add an additional week to that date.

This is a straightforward date determination without any complex transitions or calculations. In Prolog, we can represent dates and check which quarter of the year a given date belongs to.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Identify Last Day of First Quarter:**\n   - Write a rule that checks if the date falls on March 31 of a given year. This rule should identify the last day of the first quarter.\n\n3. **Quarter Determination:**\n   - Implement a function that determines the quarter of the year for a given date. This can be achieved by checking the month component (`MM`) of the date.\n\n4. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a prompt that allows users to input a date and receive confirmation of whether the date is the last day of the first quarter of 2008.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for dates within the first quarter of 2008, especially around March 31, to ensure the rule for the last day of the quarter is working correctly.\n   - Test cases could also cover dates in other quarters to validate the quarter determination function.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that identifies the last day of the first quarter of a given year, in this case, confirming that it is indeed March 31, 2008. The program will also be able to determine the quarter of any given date. This solution should be straightforward, given the lack of complex transitions or calculations involved.",

The first quarter ends on March 31, which means that yesterday was March 30, 2008.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves identifying the date one day prior to a known date. The key consideration is understanding that we are dealing with the transition from one month to another, specifically from March to April. In Prolog, we can manage this transition by defining rules that handle month boundaries and correctly identify the previous day's date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be designed to handle transitions between days within a month and across months.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Write a rule that checks if the current date is the last day of a month. If so, it should set the day to the last day of the previous month and decrement the month.\n   - For example, if the current date is `date(3, 31, 2008)`, the previous date should be set to `date(2, 30, 2008)`.\n\n3. **Normal Day Decrement:**\n   - Implement a rule for decrementing a single day within a month. This rule would simply subtract one from the day component (`DD`).\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates accurately. Leap years have 29 days in February, which changes the month-end transition logic for that month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day decrement rule until reaching the desired previous date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursive search to find the correct previous date, especially when crossing month boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those at the end of months and leap years, to ensure the program correctly handles different scenarios.\n   - Verify that the code can handle transitions from February to January and from March to February, both in normal and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately determines the previous date, accounting for month transitions and leap years.

Prolog can assist in defining rules for date arithmetic, accounting for different month lengths and potential year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Represent Dates:**\n   - Use a structured format like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure this structure allows for easy manipulation of days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, subtracting a day should take us to the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting a day from March 1, 2008, should result in February 29, 2008.\n\n3. **Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions to the previous month when subtracting days. This involves understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day values.\n   - Account for February's special case and check for leap years to determine if it has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule. This rule should decrement the requested number of days and keep track of the date changes.\n\n5. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which influences the number of days in February.\n\n6. **Utilize Prolog's Search:**\n   - Use Prolog's pattern matching and search capabilities to apply the correct rules for transitions, ensuring accurate date calculations.\n\n7. **Test Scenarios:**\n   - Test the program with various dates, especially those involving month transitions and leap years.\n   - Verify that subtracting different numbers of days, such as 5 or 10 days, produces the correct results.\n\nThe code prompt will guide users to create a Prolog program that accurately calculates a date from the past, considering monthly transitions and potential year changes. This will provide a flexible tool for date manipulation and arithmetic, handling real-world scenarios involving dates.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nToday is the last day of the first quarter of 2008, which means the current date is March 31, 2008. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate the date seven days ahead.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves finding a date one week into the future from a known starting date. This requires understanding how days accumulate and handling potential transitions across months and years. In this case, we are starting in the month of March, which has 31 days. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage these transitions and calculate the desired date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should allow for easy arithmetic operations, such as adding days.\n\n2. **Handling Normal Day Addition:**\n   - Write a rule that adds a single day to a given date. If the day is not the last day of the month, it should simply increment the day count (`DD`).\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions to the next month and year when adding days. For instance, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 31, adding one day should set `MM` to 4 (April) and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly manage the days in February when adding days across that month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Week Addition:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly adds one day to the date until seven days have been added, effectively calculating the date one week ahead.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Inference:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to find the correct path through the recursive rules, ensuring that the week addition is calculated accurately.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the week addition across different scenarios:\n       - Adding one week to March 31, 2008, should give April 7, 2008.\n       - Test the transitions between months and years, including leap years.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly query system where users can input a starting date and ask for the date one week later. Ensure that the program handles various edge cases and provides clear feedback.\n\nFollowing this plan, the resulting Prolog program will be able to calculate the date one week from today, accounting for monthly and yearly transitions and handling leap years appropriately. This will provide a practical tool for date manipulation and prediction.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from today, considering that today is the first Monday of 2019. Since the first day of 2019 was a Tuesday, the previous Tuesday was the last Tuesday of 2018 and represented the final week of the previous year. Therefore, 10 days ago from today was December 25, 2018, which can be represented as 12/25/2018 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a specific number of days (10) ago from a given date, which spans across the transition from one year to another. The key is to handle this year-end transition correctly while subtracting the days. In Prolog, we can implement rules to manage date arithmetic, including subtracting days and handling the change in years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.

This function should handle the transition between months and years when necessary.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions when subtracting days. For instance, if `DD` is 1 and `MM` is not January, then `DD` should go to the last day of the previous month. If `DD` is 1 and `MM` is January, then `YYYY` should decrement and `MM` should remain January.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to handle February dates accurately during leap years when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Use recursion in the `subtract_days` function to subtract one day at a time until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for transitions based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including transitions between months and years, and check if the correct dates are calculated 10 days ago.

        "question": "The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nToday is the first Monday of 2019, which means it is January 7, 2019, as the first day of 2019 was a Tuesday. The task is to determine the date 24 hours later, which will be January 8, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known current date, which is the first Monday of the year 2019. We need to handle the transition from one day to another within the same month and year. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by defining rules for day increments and applying them to the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure supports simple day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. For instance, if the date is January 7, 2019, then the next date should be January 8, 2019.\n\n3. **Weekday Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to determine the weekday of a given date. The first day of 2019 being a Tuesday implies that January 7, 2019, is a Monday.\n\n4. **Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Include rules to handle transitions across month and year boundaries, though these are not needed for this specific scenario.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to handle February dates accurately, even though it's not relevant for this case.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle day increments, where each recursion adds one day to the date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day increments and weekday checks based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the day increment rule with cases that stay within the same month and year, covering different weekdays.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that calculates the date 24 hours later from a given date, focusing on day increments and weekday determination. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic within a single month and year without any complex transitions.",
