                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago, given that a concert originally scheduled for June 1, 1943, was delayed by one day, making today June 2, 1943. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

Since December has only 31 days, today cannot be December 32, 1929. Therefore, the correct date today is January 1, 1930, represented as 01/01/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one year to the next, which occurs after December 31. The key is to recognize that the date rolls over to January 1 of the following year. This requires understanding both month-day boundaries and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to correctly identify when the transition to a new month and year should occur.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage both day and month increments as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should change the month to January (`MM` becomes 1), the day to 1, and increment the year (`YYYY` increases by 1).\n\n3. **Normal Case:**\n   - Write a rule that simply increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month and handles month transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between different months, recognizing that different months have different numbers of days (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days, etc.).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to determine if the year is a leap year to correctly handle February dates.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle day, month, and year transitions, making sure that the correct logic is applied depending on the date structure.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s built-in search to correctly apply rules and pattern matching, ensuring the correct date is selected when moving from one day to the next.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct transition from December 31 to January 1 across different years, including both non-leap and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately determines the date \"today\" based on the input, handling both regular and boundary cases like year transitions."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. From this information, we can deduce that today is May 1, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

Since there are no special conditions like a month or year transition, the date 24 hours later would simply be April 20, 1969. This can be represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this specific case since April has 30 days. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions."

This can be represented as 03/13/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day. This involves understanding the month-day boundaries and handling the transition from one day to the next. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 12, then the next date should be March 13, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 31, the next date should be April 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., March 12 to March 13), month-end transitions (e.g., March 31 to April 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that the year 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future, which means it will be January 1, 2015, in 12 hours. Therefore, today is December 30, 2014. One week from today would be January 6, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the new year transition from December to January. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to December 30, 2014, should result in January 6, 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation."

Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date. Since December 31 is the last day of the year, subtracting seven days means we need to go back into the previous month, December, and find the date that corresponds to seven days before December 31.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting days. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering the transition between months. For example, if `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve recursive logic and careful consideration of month and year boundaries."

If `DD` reaches the last day of the month, the rule should trigger a month increment.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This rule should reset `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January when necessary, incrementing the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover normal day increments, transitions between months, and transitions between years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\nThe question asks for the date of yesterday, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. This problem involves determining the date one day prior to the given date, which is a basic date manipulation task.\n\n**Analysis:**\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract one day from the given date, April 30, 2021. This requires handling the transition between months, as April has 30 days, and the day before April 30 is April 29. The solution will involve defining rules for date manipulation in SWI-Prolog, including handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Month, Day, Year)` to represent dates. For example, April 30, 2021, can be represented as `date(4, 30, 2021)`.\n\n2. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day value.\n\n3. **Handle Month Transition:**\n   - Implement a special case for subtracting one day when the day is the first of the month. In this case, the month should be decremented, and the day should be set to the last day of the previous month. For example, subtracting one day from May 1 should result in April 30.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Create a recursive rule to subtract multiple days from a date. This rule will repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during date calculations.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the subtraction logic with various dates, including those at the beginning and end of months, to ensure correct transitions between months and years.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date of the previous day. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, you can create a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date of yesterday based on a given date, handling month transitions correctly.",

To find the date one week ago, we need to calculate seven days before today's date, which is May 1, 2021. This calculation will involve handling the transition between April and May.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract seven days from May 1, 2021, while considering the transition from one month to another.

In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these date manipulations effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day and month decrements.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should adjust the month and day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition between months when subtracting days. For example, if we are subtracting days from May 1 and cross into April, the month should be decremented, and the day should be set to the last day of April.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to ensure that the correct rules are applied during the day subtraction process, especially when crossing month boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that validate the correct date calculation when subtracting days across month boundaries, including both regular and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week ago from a given date, handling the transition between months and considering the number of days in each month.

This involves understanding how to increment dates correctly, considering month and year boundaries. In this case, incrementing the deadline by one day will not cause a transition into a new month or year. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments within the same month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from the deadline of June 1, 2021. Given that the deadline is two days away from now, we can calculate that today's date is May 30, 2021. Therefore, the date one month ago from today would be April 30, 2021, which can be represented as 04/30/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month prior to a given date, considering the transition between months and handling potential year transitions. In this case, moving one month back from May to April does not involve a year transition. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, including month subtraction and handling month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, then the previous month should be December of the previous year. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - When subtracting a month, ensure that the day component remains valid. If the resulting date lands on a day that doesn't exist in the target month (e.g., February 30), adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the month subtraction, especially when crossing year boundaries. This will ensure that the correct number of months is subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rule for month subtraction based on the current month and year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from January, February during a leap year and a non-leap year, and other months with different day counts.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month prior to a given date, handling month transitions and day adjustments as necessary.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that the deadline is June 1, 2021, and it is currently 2 days before the deadline. This means today's date is May 30, 2021. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one week (7 days) from the given date, May 30, 2021. This involves understanding how days add up over month boundaries, as adding 7 days will take us into the next month, June. Prolog can be used to handle this calculation by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling the transition from May to June.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations, including adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between months and years when adding days.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check if adding days will result in a transition to the next month. If the `DD` exceeds the number of days in the current month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle the transition from December to January when adding days that span across the new year. If adding days causes `MM` to exceed 12, increment `YYYY` and reset `MM` to 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add multiple days. For example, to add 7 days, recursively call `add_days` with 1 day seven times.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for adding days based on the current date and the number of days to add.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including transitions between months (e.g., May 30 to June 1), transitions between years (e.g., December 30 to January 1), and leap years (e.g., February 28 to March 1 in a leap year).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week from today, considering month and year transitions and handling special cases like leap years.

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from November 12, 2019.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from November 12, 2019, which is given as tomorrow's date. To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract a month from November 12, 2019. This calculation will lead us to October 12, 2019, as the date one month prior. This date can be represented as 10/12/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of a month from a given date, considering the transition between months and potentially between years. In this case, subtracting a month from November leads us to October of the same year. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, including month subtraction and handling month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, the subtraction should result in December of the previous year.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from January 15, 2023, should give December 15, 2022.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day component when subtracting a month results in a day that doesn't exist in the target month. For example, subtracting one month from January 31 should yield February 28 (or 29 in a leap year).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the subtraction of multiple months.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today's date, which is November 12, 2019. To find the date one week from now, we need to add seven days to today's date. This calculation will result in a date of November 19, 2019, which can be represented as 11/19/2019 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a specific number of days (in this case, seven days) to a given date and determining the resulting date. The challenge is to handle the transition between days, months, and years correctly, especially when crossing month or year boundaries. In SWI-Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling month lengths and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function will handle normal day increments and month/year transitions.\n   - For example, `add_days(date(11, 12, 2019), 7, NewDate)` should result in `NewDate` being `date(11, 19, 2019)`.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months. If adding days causes the day of the month to exceed the number of days in that month, increment the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n   - Also, handle the transition from December to January by incrementing the year and resetting the month and day if necessary.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper function to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. The `add_days` function can be implemented recursively, decrementing the `Days` counter until it reaches zero.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct logic is applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the correctness of the `add_days` function for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month transitions, year transitions, and leap years.\n   - For example, test adding 7 days to November 12, 2019, adding 30 days to January 31, and adding days during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date one week from a given date, handling all necessary transitions and special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after tomorrow's date, which is given as 11/12/2019. To solve this, we need to perform two steps: First, calculate tomorrow's date, and then add another 24 hours to that date. Tomorrow's date is simply one day after today, so it will be 11/13/2019. Adding another 24 hours to this date means we move to the next day, resulting in the date 11/14/2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating the date for \"tomorrow\" and then adding another 24 hours to that date. The challenge lies in handling the transition between days correctly, especially when crossing month and year boundaries. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including adding a fixed number of hours to a given date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding hours or days.\n\n2. **Adding Hours Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_hours(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Hours, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of hours to a given date. This function should handle the transition between days, months, and years correctly.\n\n3. **Handling Day Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_hours` function, implement logic to check if adding the specified number of hours crosses the boundary of a day. If so, increment the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between months and years. If adding hours causes the day to exceed the maximum for the current month, increment the month (`MM`) and reset the day to the first of that month. If the month is December, also increment the year (`YYYY`).\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of 24 hours, which involves applying the `add_hours` function twice: once for tomorrow's date and once for the date 24 hours later.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct application of rules for day, month, and year transitions based on the current date and the number of hours added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day transitions, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.

Check if the month is within the valid range (1-12), the day is within the valid range for the given month (1-28/29/30/31 depending on the month), and if the year is a valid year format (four digits).\n\n3. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Create a structure, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent the parsed and validated date. This structure will be used for further operations or comparisons.\n\n4. **Constructing the Date:**\n   - Write a rule that takes the extracted `Month`, `Day`, and `Year` values and constructs the `date` structure.\n   - Ensure that the values are correctly assigned to the corresponding structure fields.\n\n5. **Error Handling:**\n   - Implement error handling for invalid input strings or date components. For example, if the input string does not match the expected format or if the date components are out of range.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the parsing and validation logic with various input strings, including valid dates, invalid dates, and edge cases (e.g., February 29 in non-leap years).\n   - Verify that the constructed `date` structure correctly represents the intended date.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date in the format \"MM/DD/YYYY\" and returns the constructed `date` structure or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can parse, validate, and construct a date structure from a given string in the format \"MM/DD/YYYY.\" This will involve string manipulation, date validation, and handling potential errors gracefully.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is straightforward: given today's date as August 3, 1997, determine the date of the following day, or tomorrow. Tomorrow's date will be August 4, 1997, which can be represented as 08/04/1997 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the day component of the given date by one while ensuring that the month and year remain the same. This involves understanding basic date arithmetic, particularly how to increment days within a fixed month. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date manipulation and handling month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations, especially for incrementing the day component.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date.\n   - If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment `DD` by 1.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM` by 1, handling month boundaries correctly.\n\n3. **Handling Month Boundaries:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month. For example, if today is August 31, tomorrow should be September 1.\n\n4. **Year Boundaries:**\n   - Consider handling the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year. This involves incrementing the year and resetting the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `increment_day` function with various dates, including those at the end of a month (e.g., August 31) and the end of a year (e.g., December 31).\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date of the following day.

To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date.

In this case, going one month back from August to July does not require a year transition. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, including month subtraction and handling day adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like subtracting a month.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, then decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Adjust the day component when necessary. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day, set the day to the last day of the new month. For example, if the original date is August 31, going one month back should result in July 31.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the month subtraction, especially when crossing year boundaries.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today's date, which is August 3, 1997. To find this date, we need to add seven days to today's date, taking into account any month or year transitions that may occur during this interval. The date one week from today will be August 10, 1997, represented as 08/10/1997 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a specific number of days (seven) to a given date and handling any month or year transitions that may arise. In this case, adding seven days to August 3 falls within the same month, so there is no need to worry about transitioning to a new month or year. However, in general, we need to consider these transitions and adjust the month and year accordingly. SWI-Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments, and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by one within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 8 (August) and `DD` is 3, the next date should be August 4, 1997.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month. For instance, if the date is January 31, the next date should be February 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds December. This involves incrementing the year and resetting the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for adding any number of days to a given date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will enable the program to handle various scenarios involving day increments, month transitions, and year transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including normal day increments, transitions between months, and transitions between years. For example, test the transition from January 31 to February 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week from a given date, handling both regular day increments and month/year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, leveraging Prolog's pattern matching and recursion, and considering special cases like leap years.",

The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years correctly, especially when subtracting days results in crossing a month boundary.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that today is April 19, 1969. Tomorrow's date will simply be one day later, which is April 20, 1969, represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format. This problem involves a basic increment of the day within the same month and year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem is straightforward and does not involve any complex transitions between months or years. The solution requires incrementing the day by one while ensuring that we do not exceed the number of days in the month. In this case, April has 30 days, so incrementing by one day will not cause any month or year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific case, include a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering potential month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from December 31 to January 1, and from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today's date, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from April 19, 1969. To calculate this, we need to subtract one month from the given date. Since April is the fourth month of the year, subtracting one month would take us to March, the third month. Therefore, the date one month ago from April 19, 1969, is March 19, 1969, which can be represented as 03/19/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and consider the number of days in each month. In this case, we are moving backward from April to March, which has 31 days. The logic should correctly adjust the month and retain the same day if the resulting month has enough days. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for month subtraction and handling month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one month from the given date. If the month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if the resulting day is valid for the new month. If the new month has fewer days than the original day, adjust the day to the last day of the new month. For example, if going from April 31 to March, the day should be set to March 31.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years. If the original date is February 29 in a leap year, the resulting date should be February 29 in the previous year, which is also a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering day adjustments and leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date and month subtraction.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases for various scenarios, including normal month subtraction, month-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 19 to March, from January to December, and from February 28 to January in a non-leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month ago from a given date, handling month transitions and day adjustments, and considering leap years.",

This can be represented as 04/20/1969 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a simple day increment within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the day increment does not cross any month or year boundaries, which is not a concern in this case as there are no such transitions in the given date. In SWI-Prolog, we can handle this with a straightforward rule that increments the day component of the date structure.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Month, Day, Year)` to represent dates, where `Month`, `Day`, and `Year` are integers.\n   - This structure allows for easy manipulation of date components.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule named `increment_day` that takes a `date` structure and returns a new `date` structure with the `Day` component incremented by one.\n   - For example, `increment_day(date(4, 19, 1969))` should return `date(4, 20, 1969)`.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific date, include rules to handle transitions to the next month and year when the day exceeds the maximum for the current month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February in leap years.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `increment_day` rule, including dates that span month and year boundaries, such as December 31 to January 1, and leap year dates like February 28 to February 29.\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that takes a date input and applies the `increment_day` rule to display the date 24 hours later.\n\n7. **Documentation:**\n   - Provide clear documentation explaining the `increment_day` rule, its purpose, and how it handles date manipulation.\n\nBy following this plan, a SWI-Prolog program can be developed to accurately determine the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling various date transitions and special cases, although in this specific instance, a simple day increment suffices.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February in the year 2000, which was a leap year. Leap years occur once every four years and have 366 days, including February 29. Given that today is her 16th birthday, it is now the year 2016. Tomorrow, the day after her birthday, will be March 1, 2016, which can be represented as 03/01/2016 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of Jane's birthday in 2016, considering that she was born on the last day of February in a leap year. This involves understanding leap year patterns and adding 16 years to the birth year while accounting for the varying number of days in February. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like year increments and leap year adjustments.\n\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This can be done by checking if the year is divisible by 4, with some exceptions for century years not divisible by 400.\n\n3. **Calculate Birthday Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's birthday date for a given year. If the year is a leap year, her birthday is February 29; otherwise, it is February 28.\n\n4. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Develop a function to add a certain number of years to a given date. This function should handle the transition from February to March in non-leap years and apply the leap year calculation correctly.\n\n5. **Tomorrow's Date Function:**\n   - Create a function to calculate tomorrow's date based on a given date. This function should use the `add_days` function to add one day to the input date.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define rules for date calculations, such as adding years and days.\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rules based on the input date and conditions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different birth years, both leap and non-leap, to ensure the birthday date is calculated correctly.\n   - Test the `add_years` function with various increments to verify correct date transitions, especially across month and year boundaries.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input Jane's birth year and receive the date of her birthday in the current year, as well as the date of the day after her birthday.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate Jane's birthday date for any given year, considering leap years and date transitions.",

Given that she was born in the year 2000, today's date is February 29, 2016. To find the date one month ago from today, we need to calculate the date that is one month before February 29, 2016.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month prior to February 29, 2016, considering the complexities introduced by leap years. February 29 only occurs during leap years, so we need to account for this in our calculations. In this case, the date one month ago would be January 29, 2016.

To find the date one year ago from today, we need to calculate the date of her 15th birthday, which was on February 29, 2019, as 2019 was a leap year. Therefore, the date one year ago from today is February 28, 2022, which can be represented as 02/28/2022 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of Jane's birthday in the previous year, considering that her birthday is on the last day of February and that her birthday in 2022 falls on her 16th year, indicating that she turned 15 in 2019.

This rule should apply the appropriate date subtraction and birthday calculation rules.\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the correct rules based on the input date and birthday.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different birth years, including leap years and common years, to ensure the birthday calculation and date subtraction work correctly.\n   - Verify that the program handles cases where the birthday falls on different days of the week, month, and year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a birth year and receive the date one year before their next birthday. Provide clear instructions and handle invalid inputs.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date one year before Jane's 16th birthday, considering leap years and the varying number of days in February.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday falling on the last day of February in 2024 creates a unique situation. The task is to determine the date one week before her birthday, which was on February 29, 2024, a leap day. To find the date one week earlier, we need to subtract 7 days from February 29, 2024, which would result in February 22, 2024. However, this calculation spans over the non-leap year transition from 2020 to 2024, making it a bit more complex.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date one week before a given date, considering the transition from a leap year (2024) to a non-leap year (2020). In a non-leap year, February only has 28 days. So, when subtracting 7 days from February 29, we need to account for the missing leap day and correctly handle the transition to February 28, and then February 22, in the non-leap year of 2020. In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for date subtraction, leap year detection, and month/year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including subtraction.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should handle normal day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n3. **Leap Year Detection:**\n   - Create a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling the transition from February 29 to February 28.\n\n4. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define rules to manage transitions between months, especially when subtracting days. For example, subtracting 7 days from February 29 should result in February 22 in a non-leap year.\n\n5. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one year to the next when subtracting days.

        "question": "Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, and today is her 16th birthday, which means she was born in a leap year (the year 2000). Leap years occur every four years and have 29 days in February instead of the usual 28. Today's date is February 29, 2016, and we need to calculate the date one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is one week (7 days) from February 29, 2016, taking into account the leap year and the varying number of days in different months. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic operations, including day and month increments.\n\n2. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This is crucial for correctly calculating dates in February during leap years.\n\n3. **Date Incrementation:**\n   - Define rules for incrementing days and months. For example, to increment a date by one day, add 1 to the `DD` component, and handle month and year transitions if necessary.\n\n4. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Create a rule to handle transitions between months. If incrementing the day would exceed the number of days in the current month, set the day to 1 and increment the month.\n\n5. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January, incrementing the year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic for Incrementation:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of 7 days to the given date. This will involve repeatedly applying the day incrementation rule until 7 days have passed.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the date incrementation rules with various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.\n   - Specifically, test cases involving February 29 in a leap year should be included to ensure accurate handling of leap years.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and a number of days to increment. The program should then output the resulting date.\n\n9. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Using the defined rules and functions, calculate the date one week from February 29, 2016, which is Jane's 16th birthday in a leap year.\n\nBy following this plan, a SWI-Prolog program can be developed to accurately calculate the date one week from Jane's 16th birthday, taking into account the leap year and date manipulation rules.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from Jane's 16th birthday, given that she was born on the last day of February in the year 2000. Since Jane is turning 16, it means 16 years have passed since her birth year, 2000, which makes the current year 2016. Her 16th birthday would be on February 29, 2016, as 2016 is a leap year, and February has 29 days in leap years. The date 24 hours later would be March 1, 2016, which can be represented as 03/01/2016 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a birthdate and an age. The key is to handle the leap year correctly, as February has 29 days in a leap year, and Jane's birthday falls on February 29. In Prolog, we can solve this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling leap years and date increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and days.\n\n2. **Age Calculation:**\n   - Write a function to calculate the current year based on a given birth year and age. This function will add the age to the birth year to determine the current year.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n4. **Birthday Calculation:**\n   - Write a function to calculate Jane's birthday date for a given year. If the year is a leap year, set the birthday to February 29; otherwise, set it to February 28.\n\n5. **Increment Date:**\n   - Define a rule to increment a date by one day, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of years and days, considering leap years and date transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date increments and leap year checks.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various birth years, ages, and resulting dates, especially around leap years and month-end transitions.\n\n9. **Final Date Calculation:**\n   - Given Jane's birth year and age, calculate her birthday date for the current year.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find the date 24 hours later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours after Jane's 16th birthday, considering the leap year and date transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that Jane was born on February 28, 2001 (assuming it was not a leap year), and today is her 16th birthday. This means today's date is February 28, 2017, and tomorrow's date will be March 1, 2017, which can be represented as 03/01/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of Jane's 16th birthday based on her birthdate and then determine the date of the following day. This involves understanding the concept of leap years and handling the transition between February and March. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations and handle the month transition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and incrementing days.\n\n2. **Calculate Birthday Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's birthday date in a given year. This involves adding 16 years to her birth year (2001) to get 2017. Then, set the month to February and the day to the last day of February (28 for non-leap years and 29 for leap years).\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly calculating Jane's birthday date in leap years. If the year is a leap year, set the birthday day to 29; otherwise, set it to 28.\n\n4. **Increment Day for Tomorrow:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day by one to get tomorrow's date. If the day is the last day of the month, reset it to 1 and increment the month.\n\n5. **Month Transition Handling:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition between months. If the incremented month is greater than 12, reset it to 1 and increment the year.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define rules for calculating Jane's birthday date and determining tomorrow's date.\n   - Use pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the calculated birthday date and the transition to tomorrow's date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different birth years to ensure the birthday date is calculated correctly for both leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the transition to tomorrow's date for various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input Jane's birth year and receive the date of her 16th birthday, along with the date of the following day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate Jane's 16th birthday date and determine the date of the following day, taking into account leap years and date transitions.",

If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This should consider the number of days in each month and adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Create a rule to check if a year is a leap year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from Jane's 16th birthday, given that she was born on February 28, 2001, in a non-leap year. Since today is her 16th birthday, it is February 28, 2017. Therefore, the date one month ago would be January 28, 2017, which can be represented as 01/28/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month prior to February 28, 2017, considering that Jane was born on a non-leap year, so February has only 28 days. This involves handling the transition from a shorter month (February) to a longer one (January). In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, month subtraction, and handling month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the adjustment of the day when subtracting a month. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date one month ago. This involves repeatedly applying the month subtraction rule until one month has passed.\n\n6. **Jane's Birthday Calculation:**\n   - Define a rule to calculate Jane's birthday in a given year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from Jane's 16th birthday, given that she was born on February 28, 2001, as 2001 was not a leap year. Since today is her 16th birthday, it is February 28, 2017. The date one year ago from today would be February 28, 2016. This date can be represented as 02/28/2016 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one year before a given date, considering the possibility of leap years. This involves understanding how to decrement a year from a given date and handling the transition between days and months, especially in February, which has a variable number of days depending on leap years. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to handle these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for decrementing years and days.\n\n2. **Handling Year Decrement:**\n   - Write a rule to decrement the year (`YYYY`) by 1. If the resulting year is a leap year and the month is February, adjust the day (`DD`) to 29.\n\n3. **Handling Day and Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering the number of days in each month. If `DD` becomes 0, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the new month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Create a predicate `leap_year(YYYY)` to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the previous one, considering the possibility of leap years and adjusting the day and month accordingly.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for year, month, and day transitions based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as decrementing a year in February during a leap year (e.g., from February 29, 2020, to February 29, 2016), and non-leap years (e.g., from February 28, 2017, to February 28, 2016).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year before a given date, handling the complexities of leap years and month transitions.

Since Jane is turning 16, it means 16 years have passed since her birth year, 2001, which makes the current year 2017. Her birthday falls on February 28 in non-leap years, so in 2017, her birthday would be February 28, 2017.

For example, incrementing one day from February 28 in a non-leap year should result in March 1.\n\n5. **Add and Subtract Days:**\n   - Develop recursive rules to add and subtract multiple days from a date. These rules will be useful for calculating dates like \"one week ago.\"\n\n6. **Calculate Age:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's age in a given year.

        "question": "Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, and today is her 16th birthday, which means she turned 16 years old today. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate today's date first and then add seven days to it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known birthday and age. We need to determine the current date by considering that Jane was born on the last day of February and is turning 16 today. Then, we can add seven days to that date to find the date one week from today. This requires handling month and year transitions, especially considering leap years, as February has 28 days in common years and 29 days in leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days and years.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's Birthday:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's birthday in a given year. Since she was born on the last day of February, this rule should find the number of days in February (28 or 29 for leap years) and set the birthday as the last day of that month.\n\n3. **Age Calculation:**\n   - Implement a function to calculate Jane's age in years given her birth year and the current year. This will help verify that today is indeed her 16th birthday.\n\n4. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to add a specified number of days to a given date. This function will handle day increments, month transitions, and year transitions.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to check if adding a day would cause a transition to the next month or year. Adjust `MM`, `DD`, and `YYYY` accordingly, considering the number of days in each month and handling leap years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Create a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify and apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions within the `add_days` function.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including transitions between months, leap years, and common years. For example, adding 7 days to February 28, 2023, should result in March 7, 2023.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date one week from today, considering Jane's birthday and age. This involves handling date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Jane's 16th birthday, given that she was born on the last day of February in 2001. Since Jane is turning 16, it means 16 years have passed since her birth year, 2001, which makes the current year 2017. February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year. As 2001 was a common year, Jane's birthday is February 28, 2017. The date 24 hours later would be March 1, 2017, which can be represented as 03/01/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of Jane's 16th birthday and then add 24 hours to that date. This involves understanding leap years and their impact on February's length, as well as basic date arithmetic. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including adding days and handling leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days and years.\n\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a predicate `leap_year(Year)` that checks if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for determining the length of February.\n\n3. **Calculate Birthday Date:**\n   - Write a predicate `jane_birthday(Year, Date)` that calculates the date of Jane's birthday in the given year. If `Year` is a leap year, then the birthday is February 29; otherwise, it's February 28.\n\n4. **Add Days to Date:**\n   - Create a predicate `add_days(Days, Date, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This predicate should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n5. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` predicate, implement logic to check if adding days causes a transition to a new month or year. For example, adding 30 days to January 31 should result in March 2.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion in the `add_days` predicate to repeatedly add single days until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to correctly apply rules for adding days, handling month and year transitions, and leap years.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` predicate with various scenarios, including adding days across month and year boundaries, leap years, and common years.\n\n9. **Calculate Final Date:**\n   - Use the `jane_birthday` predicate to find the date of Jane's 16th birthday (2017).\n   - Then, use the `add_days` predicate to add 24 hours (1 day) to that date to find the date 24 hours later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours after Jane's 16th birthday, considering leap years and date arithmetic.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that Jane and John married on January 2, 1958, and today is their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary typically occurs on a couple's 50th wedding anniversary. This means that 50 years have passed since their marriage, and today's date should reflect that.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly 50 years after January 2, 1958. This involves adding 50 years to the given date, considering the transitions between months and years. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between months and years correctly. For example, adding one year to February 28, 2023, should result in February 28, 2024, but adding one more year should result in February 29, 2024, considering the leap year.\n\n3. **Handling Leap Years:**\n   - Implement a helper function `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_years` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, adding one year to January 31 should result in February 28 (or 29 during a leap year), and adding another year should roll over to March 1.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple years. For instance, to add 50 years, the function should recursively call itself 50 times, adding one year at each step.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to correctly apply the rules for month and year transitions based on the current date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that Jane and John married on January 2, 1958, and today is their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage. Therefore, today's date is January 2, 2008, exactly 50 years after their wedding date. To find the date for tomorrow, we need to add one day to today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one day). The challenge is to handle the transition between days, considering the possibility of month and year changes. In Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for date manipulation, including handling month lengths and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date. This function should handle transitions between days, months, and years.\n   - If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment it.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n   - If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, increment `YYYY`, reset `MM` to January, and set `DD` to 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that repeatedly calls `increment_day` to add a single day until `Days` reaches 0.\n\n4. **Handling Month Lengths:**\n   - Within the `increment_day` function, include logic to handle different month lengths (e.g., 30 days for April, 31 days for July).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct transition (increment day, month, or year) based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including transitions between months, years, and leap years. For example, adding 1 day to January 31, 2023, should result in February 1, 2023, in a non-leap year and February 1, 2024, in a leap year.\n\n8. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Given the date of their wedding anniversary, use the `add_days` function with `Days` set to 1 to determine tomorrow's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute tomorrow's date based on a given date, handling all necessary transitions and special cases, such as month and year changes, and considering leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that Jane and John married on January 2, 1958, and today is their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary typically signifies 50 years of marriage.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is 50 years after their marriage on January 2, 1958. To find the date one month ago, we need to calculate their golden wedding anniversary date and then subtract one month from it.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two parts: calculating the date of their golden wedding anniversary and then subtracting one month from that date. The first part requires adding 50 years to their marriage date, while the second part involves handling the transition between months, potentially crossing over a year boundary. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, including year and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and subtracting months.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - This function should handle year transitions, such as when adding a year results in a leap year or a non-leap year.\n\n3. **Subtract Months Function:**\n   - Create a function `subtract_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Months, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of months from a given date.\n   - This function should handle month transitions, such as rolling back to the previous month and adjusting the day if necessary.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement logic to check for the end of a month or year when subtracting months. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original, adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to determine if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurate date calculations during leap years.\n\n6. **Golden Wedding Anniversary Calculation:**\n   - Use the `add_years` function to calculate the date of Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary by adding 50 years to their marriage date.\n\n7. **Date One Month Ago:**\n   - Apply the `subtract_months` function to the golden wedding anniversary date to find the date one month ago.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to correctly apply rules for month and year transitions when subtracting months.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_years` and `subtract_months` functions with various dates, including month-end and year-end scenarios, to ensure accurate results.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one month before Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, taking into account the addition of years and the subtraction of months, while handling transitions and leap years correctly.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today's date, given that Jane and John are celebrating their golden wedding anniversary on January 2, 2023. Their golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage, which means 50 years have passed since their wedding date of January 2, 1958. Therefore, today's date is January 2, 2023, and the date one week from today would be January 9, 2023, represented as 01/09/2023 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from today's date. This involves adding 7 days to the current date while handling the transition between months and years if necessary. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Date Arithmetic Functions:**\n   - Implement functions for adding days to a date, considering month and year transitions. These functions should handle cases where adding days results in a transition to the next month or year.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Write a rule to check if adding days to the current date would exceed the maximum number of days in the current month. If so, adjust the date to the next month and set the day accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Calculating Golden Wedding Anniversary:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of the golden wedding anniversary (50th anniversary) given a wedding date. This involves adding 50 years to the wedding year and maintaining the same month and day.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days (in this case, 7 days) by repeatedly applying the single-day addition rule.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rules for date addition based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including adding days across month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to January 2, 2023, should result in January 9, 2023.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date one week from today, taking into account the golden wedding anniversary date and handling date arithmetic and transitions effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is 50 years after their marriage on January 2, 1958. To solve this, we need to calculate their golden wedding anniversary date and then add 24 hours to it. Their golden wedding anniversary would have been on January 2, 2008. Adding 24 hours to this date would result in January 3, 2008, represented as 01/03/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating the date of their golden wedding anniversary and then adding 24 hours to that date. The first step requires adding 50 years to their marriage date, considering potential leap years and handling year and month transitions. The second step is a simple day increment, which also needs to account for month-end and year-end transitions.

        "question": "Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that Jane started her job in 2016 and today is her 3-year work anniversary. Additionally, she recalls that on her second day at work, December 2, she spilled coffee on her laptop. Based on this information, we can deduce that her first day at work was December 1, 2016, and today is December 1, 2019. Therefore, the date today is 12/01/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate today's date based on the anniversary of a past event that occurred on a specific date. This involves understanding the concept of date arithmetic, including year increments and handling month and day values correctly. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to calculate the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for year increments and day/month adjustments.\n\n2. **Calculate Work Anniversary:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's work anniversary date for a given year. This involves adding one day to the date December 1, 2016, and then incrementing the year by one for each additional year of work.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years correctly. For example, if the date is December 31, incrementing the month should result in January of the following year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February when incrementing years. This is important for maintaining the accuracy of dates in the future.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate the work anniversary for multiple years. This will involve repeatedly applying the year increment rule until the desired number of years has been reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rules for date manipulation based on the current date structure. This will ensure that date transitions are handled correctly.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the accuracy of the work anniversary calculation for different years, including leap years and non-leap years. For example, test the calculation for the second anniversary (2018) and the third anniversary (2019).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine today's date based on the anniversary of a past event, taking into account year increments and date transitions. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "question": "Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from Jane's three-year work anniversary, considering that she started her job in 2016 and remembers spilling coffee on her laptop on December 2, which was her second day at work. This information allows us to deduce that her work anniversary is December 1 each year. Therefore, one month before this date would be November 1 of the same year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month prior to December 1, taking into account that December has 31 days. This involves understanding month transitions and correctly adjusting the date components (month, day, and year) to arrive at the desired date. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day, set the day to the maximum for the new month. For example, if the original date is January 31, one month back should be December 31, not January 30.\n\n4. **Special Case: Year Transition:**\n   - Handle the special case of transitioning from December to January when subtracting a month. In this case, the year should be decremented, and the month should be set to December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February during month subtraction. If the original date is in February and it is a leap year, ensure that the resulting date is adjusted accordingly.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the month subtraction, especially when crossing year boundaries. This will ensure that multiple months can be subtracted accurately.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to select the correct rule for month subtraction based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from January, February in leap and non-leap years, and December. Verify that the year transitions are handled correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one month before Jane's work anniversary, taking into account month transitions and potential year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, and she started her job in 2016. Since her second day at work was December 2, 2016, we can deduce that today is December 3, 2019. Therefore, the date one week from today would be December 10, 2019, represented as 12/10/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from the given date, considering the transition between months and years. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days and years.\n\n2. **Date Arithmetic Functions:**\n   - Implement functions for basic date arithmetic, such as adding days to a date and incrementing years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if adding days results in a date like October 32, the function should roll over to November 1 of the same year.\n   - Special handling is needed for December, where adding days might roll over to January of the next year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during date additions.\n\n5. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the appropriate rules for adding days, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days across month boundaries (e.g., from November 30 to December 1), year boundaries (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and leap years (e.g., adding days to February 28 or 29).\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given today's date, use the `add_days` function to calculate the date one week from today by adding 7 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week from a given date, considering transitions between days, months, and years, as well as handling leap years.",

Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be December 3, 2019, represented as 12/03/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 24 hours later from a given date, considering year transitions.

Implement this function recursively, decrementing `DaysToAdd` by 1 and calling itself until `DaysToAdd` reaches 0.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months. If adding a day causes `DD` to exceed the number of days in the current month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n   - Also, handle the transition from December to January by incrementing `YYYY` when necessary.\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate `leap_year(YYYY)` to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that `add_days` correctly handles day overflow. For example, adding 1 day to January 31 should result in February 1, not January 32.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including crossing month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap years. For example, test adding 176 days to March 20, 2020, to validate the expected result.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a starting date and the number of days to add, then display the resulting date.\n\n8. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities and pattern matching to implement the `add_days` function, ensuring that the correct transition rules are applied based on the current date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date some days after a given date, handling all necessary transitions and special cases, including month and year changes and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from a specific date, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To solve this, we need to calculate the date that is 176 days after March 20, 2020, and then subtract 10 days from that result.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: first, calculating a date some days (176 days) after a given date, and second, subtracting 10 days from that resulting date. The challenge lies in handling the transitions between months and years, especially when crossing over to a new year. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` that adds `DaysToAdd` to the given date. This function should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n   - If adding days causes the day (`DD`) to exceed the number of days in the current month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n   - If adding days causes a transition to a new year, increment `YYYY`.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToSubtract, NewDate)` that subtracts `DaysToSubtract` from the given date. This function will essentially perform the reverse operation of `add_days`.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions to correctly handle transitions between months and years. This includes adjusting for different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to implement the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions. This will allow for adding or subtracting multiple days by repeatedly applying the functions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added or subtracted.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including adding and subtracting days across month and year boundaries, leap years, and non-leap years.\n\n9. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a starting date and the number of days to add or subtract, then displays the resulting date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately calculate dates some days after or before a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as month and year boundaries and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from today's date, which is 176 days after Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 176 days earlier than today and then determine the date one month before that calculated date. This involves understanding date arithmetic, including handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem can be divided into two parts: calculating the date 176 days earlier and then determining the date one month before that calculated date. The first part involves simple date subtraction, while the second part requires handling month boundaries and potential year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and predicates to perform these calculations and handle the necessary transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days, as well as month and year transitions.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a predicate `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, ResultDate)` that subtracts a given number of days from a date. This predicate should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_days` predicate, include logic to check if the resulting day is less than 1. If so, decrement the day and increment the month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To solve this, we need to calculate the date that was 176 days before March 20, 2020, and then subtract one year from that date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating a date some days before a given date and then subtracting one year from that calculated date. The first step requires understanding how to decrement days from a date, considering month and year boundaries. The second step involves decrementing the year and handling any month and day adjustments that may arise due to the year change. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle operations like subtracting days and years.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a given number of days from a date. It should decrement `DD` by 1 and handle month and year transitions correctly.\n   - If `DD` becomes 0, increment `MM` by 1 and reset `DD` to the last day of the new month. If `MM` is December, increment `YYYY` by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `subtract_days` to handle transitions between months and years correctly. For example, subtracting 1 day from January 1, 2020, should result in December 31, 2019.\n\n4. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Create a function `subtract_one_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that decrements the year by 1 and handles month and day adjustments.\n   - If the current date is January to March, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the new month. If `MM` becomes 0, set it to 12.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days and the transition between dates correctly.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to ensure the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_days` function with various dates and day counts to ensure correct transitions between months and years.\n   - Test the `subtract_one_year` function for different dates, including leap years, to ensure accurate year subtraction and date adjustments.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date one year before a given date, handling all necessary transitions and adjustments due to month and year changes, as well as leap years.",

To solve this, we need to calculate the date that was 176 days after March 20, 2020, and then subtract 7 days from that date to find the date one week ago.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: first, calculating a date a certain number of days ahead, and second, subtracting a certain number of days from that date. The challenge is to handle month and year transitions correctly, especially when crossing over to a new month or year. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Adding Days to a Date:**\n   - Write a rule `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` to add a certain number of days to a given date. This rule should handle month and year transitions correctly, adjusting for different month lengths and leap years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` rule, implement logic to check if adding the specified number of days crosses a month boundary. If so, adjust the month and day accordingly, considering the number of days in each month.\n   - Also, handle the transition from one year to the next when adding days that span across two years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Subtracting Days from a Date:**\n   - Write another rule `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToSubtract, NewDate)` to subtract a certain number of days from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To solve this, we need to calculate today's date by adding 176 days to March 20, 2020, and then add 7 more days to find the date one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two parts: calculating today's date based on the number of days passed since a given date, and then adding one week to that date. The challenge is to handle the transitions between months and years accurately when adding a large number of days. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage these transitions and calculate the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days and months.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - If adding days causes the day (`DD`) to exceed the maximum for the current month, increment the month and reset the day to 1.\n   - Handle month-end transitions correctly, considering different month lengths.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. If adding days causes the month to exceed 12, increment the year and reset the month to January.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Add Weeks Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_weeks(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Weeks, NewDate)` that calls `add_days` to add 7 days for each week.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursion to implement the `add_days` function, repeatedly adding a single day until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including crossing month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap years.\n   - Verify the `add_weeks` function by adding different numbers of weeks to various dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate today's date based on the given information and then determine the date one week from today, handling all necessary date transitions and special cases.",

        "question": "2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be one and a half days from now. Therefore, if 2015 is coming in one and a half days, today must be December 30, 2014. This date can be represented as 12/30/2014 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the current date based on the information that a future date (2015) is a certain number of hours away. This involves understanding the relationship between hours, days, and dates. In Prolog, we can use rules and arithmetic operations to calculate the current date relative to the given future date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for dates and times, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(Hour, Min, Sec)`.\n   - Ensure that these structures can handle arithmetic operations for adding or subtracting time and dates.\n\n2. **Conversion Functions:**\n   - Implement functions to convert between hours and days. For example, `hours_to_days(Hours, Days)` would convert hours to fractional days.\n\n3. **Date Arithmetic:**\n   - Write rules for basic date arithmetic, such as adding or subtracting days from a given date. This will be useful for calculating the current date based on the future date.\n\n4. **Time to Date Conversion:**\n   - Create a function `time_to_date(time(Hour, Min, Sec), date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to convert a time duration to a date increment. This will handle the addition of 36 hours to the current date.\n\n5. **Handling Hour Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to handle hour overflow when converting time to date. For example, 24 hours should be converted to a date increment of one day.\n\n6. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for accurate date calculations during leap years.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define rules for adding or subtracting time and dates, handling various transitions and overflows.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for date and time arithmetic, ensuring accurate results.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including adding and subtracting time, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the current date based on a future date and a given time duration, handling all necessary conversions and date arithmetic accurately.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be one and a half days from now. This means that today is the last day before 2015, which is December 31, 2014. Tomorrow will be the first day of 2015, which is January 1, 2015, and can be represented as 01/01/2015 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate tomorrow's date based on the understanding that 2015 is coming in 36 hours. This involves recognizing that 36 hours is one and a half days from now, so we need to calculate the date for one day from now and then add another half-day to it. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like adding days and months.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `add_one_day(Date, NewDate)` that adds one day to a given date. If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment it. If it is the last day, reset `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n\n3. **Handle Month End and Year Transition:**\n   - Within the `add_one_day` rule, include logic to handle the transition from the last day of the month to the first day of the next month. If `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, then set `MM` to 1 (January), `DD` to 1, and increment `YYYY` by 1.\n\n4. **Add Half-Day Rule:**\n   - Write another rule `add_half_day(Date, NewDate)` that adds 12 hours to a given date. This can be achieved by incrementing `DD` by 1 and then checking if it exceeds the maximum number of days in the current month. If it does, adjust `DD` to the last day of the month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule `add_days(Days, Date, NewDate)` that repeatedly calls `add_one_day` until `Days` reaches 0. This will handle adding any number of days to a date.\n\n6. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a predicate to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_one_day` and `add_half_day` rules with various dates, including month-end and year-end scenarios, to ensure correct transitions.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and the number of hours, and then displays the date for that many hours in the future.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date a certain number of hours in the future, considering day, month, and year transitions, and handling leap years.",

First, we need to calculate the date that is 36 hours away. Given that there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours is equivalent to 1 day and 12 hours. Therefore, 36 hours from now would be January 2, 2015, which is 1 day and 12 hours later. Then, we need to go back 10 days from that date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including handling the transition between years. The plan is to first calculate the date 36 hours from now and then subtract 10 days from that date.

This function will handle the transition to the next day and month if needed.\n\n3. **Function to Subtract Days from a Date:**\n   - Develop a function `subtract_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date. This function should handle month-end and year-end transitions, decrementing the month and year if necessary.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next when subtracting days. For example, if subtracting days takes us from January to December of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling the number of days in February during date subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of hours and the subtraction of days.

        "question": "2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from an unspecified date, given that the year 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours is equivalent to one day and a half. This means that in one month and one day from now, it will be January 1, 2015. Therefore, going one month backward, the date a month ago would be November 30, 2014, which can be represented as 11/30/2014 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month prior to a future date. This involves understanding how to subtract a month from a date that falls within a different year. In this case, we are subtracting a month from a date in January 2015 to get a date in November 2014. We need to consider the transition from one year to another when subtracting a month. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the date one month prior to the input date.\n   - This function should handle the transition from one month to another, considering different month lengths and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `subtract_month` to check if the resulting month is before January. If so, decrement the year and set the month to the last month of the previous year.\n\n4. **Day Adjustment:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid after subtracting a month. If the resulting day is greater than the maximum number of days in the resulting month, adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of dates across month and year boundaries. For example, if the input date is in January 2015, the function should recognize that it needs to subtract a month and a year to get to November 2014.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the input date, ensuring that month and year transitions are handled accurately.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that validate the `subtract_month` function for various scenarios, including transitions between months, years, and leap years. For example, subtracting a month from January 15, 2015, should result in December 15, 2014.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month prior to a given date, even when crossing year boundaries, and considering the varying lengths of months and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, given that 2015 is coming in 36 hours. First, we need to calculate today's date based on the information provided. If 2015 is arriving in 36 hours, then today must be December 30, 2014, or 12/30/2014. The date one year ago from today would be December 30, 2013, which can be represented as 12/30/2013 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform two main operations: calculate today's date based on the given information and then subtract one year from that date. This involves understanding how to calculate dates a certain number of days in the future and then subtracting an entire year, taking into account any month and day adjustments that may be necessary. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate today's date based on the given information. In this case, \"2015 is coming in 36 hours\" means that today is 2014, and we need to determine the month and day.\n\n3. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Develop a function to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year by 1 and then adjusting the month and day if necessary. For example, if the date is January 1, decrementing the year should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the resulting month and day need to be adjusted. For example, if the original date is January 31, the date one year ago should be February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling the end of February during year subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define rules for adding and subtracting days, months, and years. This will allow for flexible date manipulation.\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the input date and the operations being performed.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including different starting dates, month-end and year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test subtracting one year from February 28 in both a leap year and a non-leap year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date or a statement like \"2015 is coming in X hours\" and receive the date one year prior as the output.\n\nBy following this plan, the SWI-Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one year prior to today's date, considering all necessary adjustments for months, days, and leap years.

Subtracting seven days from December 30 takes us to December 23, 2014.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform two main calculations: finding today's date based on the given information and then calculating the date one week ago from today's date. This involves handling date subtraction, month transitions, and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations like subtraction.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate today's date based on the given information. In this case, we need to subtract one and a half days from January 1, 2015, to find today's date, December 30, 2014.\n\n3. **Handle Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a certain number of days from a given date. This rule should consider month and year transitions when subtracting days. For example, subtracting 7 days from December 30 should result in December 23.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Create rules to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For instance, if the day goes below 1, decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly. If the month becomes negative, decrement the year and adjust the month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which will be important for accurately handling February during date subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion to subtract multiple days from a date. The function should repeatedly subtract one day until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules for date subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases to validate the correctness of the date subtraction logic, including scenarios that involve month-end and year-end transitions, as well as leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from today, taking into account the given information about the arrival of 2015 in 36 hours. This will involve date manipulation, handling transitions between days, months, and years, and considering leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from a given starting point, which is 36 hours before the year 2015 begins. This problem involves two steps: first, calculating the date when 2015 begins (in 36 hours), and second, adding another 24 hours to find the desired date. \n\nGiven that there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future. So, 2015 begins in 1 day, which means today is December 30, 2014. Now, we need to calculate the date 24 hours later from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, adding 24 hours to the calculated date of December 30, 2014. This involves incrementing the day by one, considering the transition from one day to the next, and potentially handling a transition from one month to another. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations and handle transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle day and month arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` to calculate the next day's date. If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment it. If it is the last day, reset `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to the next. For example, if today is November 30, tomorrow should be December 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year. If `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, then the next date should be January 1 of the next year (YYYY+1).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct rules are applied based on the current date during the day increment process.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `increment_day` rule for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.\n\n9. **Calculate 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Using the `increment_day` rule, calculate the date 24 hours later from December 30, 2014, which is the date when 2015 begins.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours later from a given starting point, handling date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and considering leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to convert a date from the UK format (DD/MM/YYYY) to the standard MM/DD/YYYY format used in the previous tasks. The given date is 02/01/1987 in UK format, which means the day is 2, the month is 1 (January), and the year is 1987. To convert it to the standard format, we need to swap the positions of the day and month, resulting in 01/02/1987.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves rearranging the components of the date to match the desired format. Specifically, we need to move the month to the first position and the day to the second position while keeping the year unchanged. In Prolog, this can be achieved by breaking down the date into its components, rearranging them, and then reconstructing the date in the new format.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent the UK format date, with day, month, and year components.\n   - Define another structure, `standard_date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent the desired standard format date.\n\n2. **Date Component Extraction:**\n   - Write a rule to extract the day, month, and year components from the UK format date. For example, given `date(2, 1, 1987)`, extract `2`, `1`, and `1987`.\n\n3. **Date Component Rearrangement:**\n   - Implement a rule to rearrange the components to match the standard format. In this case, swap the positions of the day and month. For the given example, this would result in `standard_date(1, 2, 1987)`.\n\n4. **Date Reconstruction:**\n   - Define a rule to reconstruct the standard format date from the rearranged components.

For example, test the transition from December 30 to December 31, and from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date in UK format and receive the date of the following day in standard format. Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can handle the conversion of dates between UK and standard formats, perform day increments, and provide the date for the following day, taking into account month and year transitions, as well as leap years.",

        "question": "In the UK, people usually put the day before the month when formatting the date. Therefore, today is 02/01/1987 to them. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, February 1, 1987, which is formatted according to the UK style with day before month. To calculate the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current year and consider any necessary adjustments for month and day values.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from the given date, which may involve adjusting the month and day values accordingly. In this case, subtracting one year from February 1, 1987, would result in a date in 1986. However, we need to consider that February, the original month, only has 28 days in a standard year. Therefore, we need to adjust the month and day values to the previous month and the last day of that month, which is January 31, 1986.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (DD/MM/YYYY).\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic, including subtraction of years.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_year(date(DD, MM, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from the given date.\n   - If `MM` is January, then the year should be decremented, and `MM` and `DD` should be set to 12 and 31, respectively, for the previous month's last day.\n   - For other months, the year should be decremented, and the `MM` and `DD` should be adjusted accordingly to the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic within the `subtract_year` function to handle the adjustment of `MM` and `DD` based on the original month. This will ensure that the resulting date is valid for the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year. This will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the previous one, considering any necessary adjustments to the month and day values.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the original month and day values.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including standard and leap years, and various months and days. For example, subtracting one year from February 1, 1987, should result in January 31, 1986.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date in the UK format and receive the date one year prior. Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year prior to a given date, considering month and day adjustments during year subtraction. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and utilizing Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today's date, February 1, 1987, in the UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY). To solve this, we need to increment the date by one day, considering the month and year boundaries. The date 24 hours later would be February 2, 1987, which in the UK format is 02/02/1987.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the day within the same month and year. The challenge is to handle the transition between days correctly, especially when dealing with months of different lengths. In Prolog, we can define rules for incrementing the day, checking for month boundaries, and handling year transitions if necessary.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (DD/MM/YYYY).\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments within the same month and year.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(date(DD, MM, YYYY), date(NewDD, MM, YYYY))` to increment the day by one. If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply add 1 to it.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule `end_of_month(MM, DD)` to check if a given day (`DD`) is the last day of a given month (`MM`). This rule will be crucial for handling month transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Define a rule `end_of_year(MM, DD)` to handle the transition from December to January, ensuring that the year is incremented correctly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the date is incremented correctly even across month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to apply the `increment_day` rule or month/year transition rules based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as incrementing a date within the same month, transitioning between months, and crossing year boundaries.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Using the defined rules, calculate the date 24 hours later by applying the `increment_day` rule once.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can handle the UK date format and correctly determine the date 24 hours later, considering potential month and year transitions.

This problem requires deductive reasoning to conclude that if the flight is booked for July 29, then today must be July 28, 2002. This date can be represented as 07/28/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between \"tomorrow's date\" and \"today's date.\" In this context, \"tomorrow\" refers to the date of the flight, July 29, 2002. By subtracting one day from this date, we can determine \"today's date.\" In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including the ability to decrement days and handle month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day decrements within the same month and across month boundaries.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to subtract one day from a given date.\n   - If `DD` is greater than 1, then `NewDate` should be `date(MM, DD - 1, YYYY)`.\n   - If `DD` is 1, then `MM` should be decremented, and `DD` should be set to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `decrement_day` rule to handle transitions between months. If decrementing `DD` results in a negative number, then `MM` should be decremented, and `DD` should be set to the last day of the previous month.\n   - Special handling is needed for December to January transitions, where `YYYY` should also be decremented.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle multiple day decrements, especially when crossing month boundaries. This will ensure that the correct number of days is subtracted even when transitioning between months.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct date manipulation is performed based on the current date and the desired operation (decrementing a day in this case).\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day decrements, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, test cases could include decrementing a date from July 29 to July 28, from December 31 to December 30, and from January 1 to December 31.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine \"today's date\" based on the given \"tomorrow's date.\" This will involve defining rules for date manipulation, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.",

Since the flight is scheduled for tomorrow, today's date is July 28, 2002. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be July 29, 2002, which can be represented as 07/29/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date of the following day from a given date. The key is to understand how to increment the day correctly, considering month and year boundaries. In this case, July has 31 days, so incrementing the day by one will not cause a transition to the next month. However, the plan should still consider such transitions for general applicability. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and checking for leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments within the same month and across month and year boundaries.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when `DD` exceeds the number of days in the current month. This rule should adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly, considering different month lengths.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year when `MM` exceeds 12 (December). This rule should increment `YYYY` and reset `MM` and `DD` to January 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Create a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.

For example, test cases could include incrementing from July 30 to July 31, from December 31 to January 1, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date for tomorrow based on a given date, handling month and year transitions and considering leap years.

        "question": "Jane booked a flight for tomorrow, Jul 29, 2002. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that Jane has booked a flight for July 29, 2002. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from July 29, 2002. This date calculation does not involve any month or year transitions, as July has 31 days. Therefore, the date yesterday was July 28, 2002.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a single day from a given date, which can be achieved by decrementing the day value by one. In Prolog, we can define a rule that handles this day subtraction, considering the number of days in the given month. Since there are no month or year transitions in this specific case, the logic remains straightforward.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Normal Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day from the given date, considering the number of days in the month. If `DD` is greater than 1, decrement it by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific case, include a general rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days and reaching the first day of the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., July 29 to July 28), month-end transitions (e.g., July 1 to June 30), and year-end transitions (e.g., January 1 to December 31).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for yesterday based on a given date, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, considering month lengths, and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply the rules effectively.",

This involves decrementing `MM` and adjusting `DD` based on the number of days in the previous month.\n\n4. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the previous year if the month subtraction results in a negative month value.

To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from July 29, 2002. This calculation involves handling month and year transitions correctly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the number of days in each month and handle the transition from one month to the previous one.

To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting a specified number of days (7 days) from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days. In this case, subtracting 7 days from July 28, 2002, would take us back to July 21, 2002. Prolog can be used to implement rules for date subtraction, handling month and year transitions correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle subtraction of days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should adjust to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, subtracting a day from January 1 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day subtractions, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that Jane has booked a flight for July 29, 2002, which is tomorrow. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date, July 28, 2002. This calculation will lead us to the date August 4, 2002, which can be represented as 08/04/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a specific number of days (7 days) to a given date while handling potential month and year transitions. In this case, adding 7 days to July 28, 2002, does not cross any month or year boundaries, so the solution is straightforward. However, in general, we need to consider these transitions and adjust the month and year accordingly. SWI-Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and managing leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` to add `DaysToAdd` to the given date. If `DD` + `DaysToAdd` exceeds the maximum days in `MM`, then carry over to the next month, and if `MM` is December, increment `YYYY`.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` rule to handle transitions between months and years. If adding days causes the month to exceed 12, increment the year and reset the month to January.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. For example, to add 7 days, repeatedly apply the `add_days` rule with `DaysToAdd` set to 1 until `DaysToAdd` reaches 0.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, given that she visits on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. To find the date of her fifth visit, we need to calculate the date that is five months after October 2009, and then determine the 16th day of that month. This involves understanding date arithmetic, including month and year increments.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the date that is five months after October 2009. This involves incrementing the month by five, considering the transition from one year to the next if necessary.\n2. Determine the 16th day of the calculated month. This may require adjusting the day if the calculated month does not have 16 days (e.g., in February).\n3. Ensure that the resulting date is correct by considering potential leap years.\n\nIn Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions, rules, and recursion to handle these calculations and adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle month and year arithmetic.\n\n2. **Increment Month Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), MonthsToAdd, NewDate)` that increments the month by `MonthsToAdd`. If the resulting month is greater than 12, adjust the month and increment the year accordingly.\n\n3. **Find 16th Day of the Month:**\n   - Implement a function `find_16th_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that checks if `DD` is already 16. If not, use `increment_day` to add days until `DD` reaches 16.\n\n4. **Handling Month End and Leap Years:**\n   - Within `increment_day`, include logic to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n   - Also, include a leap year check to correctly handle February, ensuring that it has 29 days during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple months and days, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the input date and the number of months/days added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various starting dates and numbers of months/days added to ensure correct date calculations, including transitions across month and year boundaries and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date of Jane's bookstore visits, considering the specific pattern of her visits and handling date arithmetic and adjustments effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, which occurs on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. To solve this, we need to calculate the date of her fifth visit and then subtract 10 days from that date. Jane's fifth visit would be on March 16, 2010, and the date 10 days prior to that would be March 6, 2010, or 03/06/2010 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating the date of Jane's fifth visit and then subtracting 10 days from that date. The first step requires understanding the pattern of her visits (16th of each month) and using date arithmetic to reach the fifth occurrence. The second step involves handling the subtraction of days, considering month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to achieve these steps.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding and subtracting days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Jane's Bookstore Visit Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's bookstore visit for a given month and year. This rule should add the appropriate number of months and years to the starting date (October 2009) to reach the desired visit number (fifth visit).\n\n3. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract 10 days from a given date, considering month and year transitions. If the resulting day is less than 1, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle month and year transitions when subtracting days. For example, subtracting 10 days from March 16 may result in a date in February, requiring adjustments to the month and day.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Add a predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Jane's fifth visit and the subtraction of 10 days, considering all necessary transitions and adjustments.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different visit numbers and varying numbers of days to subtract, ensuring that the program handles month and year transitions accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate dates based on Jane's bookstore visits and perform date arithmetic, taking into account various transitions and special cases.",

Subtract one year from that date to find the date one year ago.\n\nIn Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including addition and subtraction of months and years.\n\n2. **Jane's Visit Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's bookstore visits based on the pattern: 16th of each month starting from October 2009. This rule should increment the month and year accordingly for each visit.\n\n3. **Year Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a function to subtract one year from a given date. If the month is before January, decrement the year and set the month to the corresponding month in the previous year.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid when subtracting a year. If the resulting date lands on a non-existent day (e.g., February 30), adjust the day to the last valid day of that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the calculation of Jane's visit dates and the subtraction of one year. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in selecting the correct rules based on the current date and visit count.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different visit counts to ensure the correct dates are calculated for each visit.\n   - Verify that the year subtraction works correctly for various dates, including leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one year before Jane's bookstore visit based on the given pattern. This involves understanding date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, starting from October 2009, and today is her 5th visit. This problem involves calculating the date based on a recurring event with a specific pattern. Since today is Jane's 5th visit, we need to calculate the date of her 5th visit and then add one week to that date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the date of Jane's 5th visit: Starting from October 2009, we need to add 4 months to reach the month of Jane's 5th visit. This will be February 2010.\n2. Determine the date of the 16th: Since Jane visits on the 16th, we need to set the day to 16 for the calculated month and year.\n3. Add one week to the calculated date: Finally, we need to add 7 days to the date of Jane's 5th visit to find the date one week from today.\n\nIn Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions, rules, and arithmetic operations to perform these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding months and days.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's Visit Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's `N`th visit. This involves adding `N` months to the starting date (October 2009) and setting the day to 16.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to add a certain number of days to a given date. This function will be used to add one week (7 days) to the calculated date of Jane's 5th visit.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. For example, adding days to January 31 should result in February, and adding days to December should eventually increment the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for adding months and days based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various scenarios, including visits that span across different months and years, and handle leap years correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date of Jane's visits based on a recurring pattern and then determine the date one week from a specific visit.

        "question": "Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from the October of 2009. It is her 5th visit to the bookstore today. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, which occurs on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. To solve this, we need to calculate the date of her fifth visit and then add 24 hours to that date. Given that her visits start from October 2009, the fifth visit would be in March 2010, which is five months later. Therefore, the date of her fifth visit is March 16, 2010. Adding 24 hours to this date gives us March 17, 2010, as the date 24 hours later.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating the date of Jane's fifth visit and then adding 24 hours to that date. The first step requires understanding the pattern of her visits (16th of each month) and performing date arithmetic to reach the fifth visit. The second step involves incrementing the day by one while handling month and year boundaries. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to achieve these steps.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding months and days.\n\n2. **Jane's Visit Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's visit based on the starting date and the number of visits. This rule should add the appropriate number of months to the starting date to reach the month of the fifth visit.\n\n3. **Adding Months Rule:**\n   - Implement a function to add a single month to a given date, considering the transition between months and years. For example, adding a month to January should result in February, and adding a month to December should increment the year and reset to January.\n\n4. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day by 24 hours, handling the transition between days and months. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the month, adjust the day and month accordingly.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year Boundaries:**\n   - Include specific rules to handle transitions between months and years, such as when adding months or incrementing days.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the current date and the number of visits.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different starting dates and visit numbers to ensure the correct dates are calculated, especially when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours after Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, considering the pattern of her visits and handling date arithmetic effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow based on the given information that Jane thought today was March 11, 2002, but in reality, it is one day later, making today March 12, 2002. To find the date for tomorrow, we simply need to add one day to today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date. The challenge is to handle the transition between days correctly, especially when crossing the boundary from one month to another. In this case, adding one day to March 12, 2002, should result in March 13, 2002. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, including handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `add_one_day(Date, NewDate)` that adds one day to a given date.\n   - If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment `DD` by 1.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, increment `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when adding days. This includes checking if `DD` is greater than the maximum days in the current `MM` and adjusting `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month based on the current date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_one_day` rule with various dates, including transitions between months (e.g., from March 31 to April 1) and handling leap years (e.g., February 28 to February 29 in a leap year).\n\n7. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Given today's date as `date(3, 12, 2002)`, use the `add_one_day` rule to calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute tomorrow's date based on a given date, handling day and month transitions correctly.

If the year is a leap year, February will have 29 days, affecting the day adjustment when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Adjust Day for Previous Month:**\n   - When transitioning to the previous month, ensure that the day is valid for that month.

If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n   - If the day is the first, decrement the month and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from March 12, 2002, given that Jane thought today was March 11, 2002. The correct date today is March 12, 2002, which is one day later than Jane's assumption. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date one year prior to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition from one year to another, which may include adjusting the month and day values accordingly. In this case, subtracting one year from March 12, 2002, would mean going back to March 2001. However, since 2001 is a leap year, we need to consider the extra day in February.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the year is a leap year, check if the date falls within the leap year period (between March 1 of the current year and February 29 of the next year). If so, adjust the date accordingly.\n\n3. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a function to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling the extra day in February during leap years.\n\n4. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - When subtracting a year, consider the number of days in each month and adjust the month and day values as needed. For example, if the original date is January 31, then subtracting one year should result in January 31 of the previous year. However, if the original date is February 29 in a leap year, then the resulting date would be February 28 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of dates across year boundaries. This will ensure that the code can handle any number of years being subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to correctly apply the rules for year subtraction, considering leap years and month/day adjustments.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a year from February 29 during a leap year, from December 31, and from regular dates in non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute a date one year prior to a given date, taking into account leap years and adjustments for month and day values.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that it is the first day of the year 2007. If today is the first day of the year, then it is January 1, and the year is specified as 2007. Therefore, the date can be represented as 01/01/2007 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to establish a clear representation of dates in SWI-Prolog and define rules for interpreting the given information (\"Today is the first day of 2007\") to extract the month, day, and year components of the date. This involves understanding how to structure date information in Prolog and how to apply rules to extract specific date components.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle different date components and operations.\n\n2. **Natural Language Processing:**\n   - Implement a rule to process the natural language input \"Today is the first day of 2007.\" This rule should identify the day (\"first\"), month (\"implicitly January\"), and year (\"2007\") from the input sentence.\n\n3. **Extracting Date Components:**\n   - Write rules to extract the month, day, and year components from the input sentence. For example, use patterns to match phrases like \"the first day\" to extract \"1\" as the day component.\n\n4. **Date Construction:**\n   - Create a rule to construct the `date` structure using the extracted components. This rule should ensure that the day and month are within valid ranges (e.g., month between 1 and 12, day between 1 and the maximum for the given month).\n\n5. **Handling Invalid Inputs:**\n   - Implement error handling for cases where the input sentence does not match the expected pattern or contains invalid date information. For example, if the input mentions an invalid month or a day that is out of range for the given month.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with various input sentences to ensure it can correctly extract date components and construct valid dates. For example, \"Today is the second day of January 2023\" or \"It's the 30th of April, 2021.\"\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a sentence describing a date and receive the corresponding date in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can interpret natural language descriptions of dates and convert them into a structured date format, handling various input scenarios and providing clear error messages for invalid inputs.",

This date can be represented as 01/02/2007 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the day component of the given date by one, considering the transition between months and years. In this case, incrementing the day from the 1st to the 2nd does not involve crossing any month or year boundaries. However, the solution should be generalizable to handle such transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day, month, and year increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to the input date.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, the function should set `MM` to the next month and `DD` to 1.\n   - Handle month-end transitions correctly, considering the varying number of days in different months.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from the first day of 2007. If today is the first day of the year, it means it is January 1, so 10 days ago would be in the previous year, 2006. To find the exact date, we need to calculate the date that is 10 days before January 1, 2007.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one year to another when subtracting days. This involves understanding month-day boundaries and correctly adjusting the month, day, and year when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day and month decrements, as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month and year transitions. If `DD` is 1, then subtracting one day should result in the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to another when subtracting days. For example, subtracting days from January 1 may require transitioning to the previous month (December) and year (YYYY-1).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February during the subtraction process.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 days) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1 or December 31.\n   - Verify the program's ability to handle various numbers of days to be subtracted, including cases like 1 day, 10 days, and dates spanning multiple months or years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions, such as month-end and year-end cases, and handling leap years.

Since there are seven days in a week, we need to calculate the date that is seven days ahead from January 1, 2007. This calculation involves adding days to the current date while considering the possibility of transitioning between months and years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the addition of days to a date, taking into account month and year transitions. In this case, adding seven days to January 1, 2007, will not cross any month or year boundaries, so we only need to consider the addition of days within the same month and year. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, including handling the addition of days and checking for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function will handle normal day increments within the same month and transitions to the next month when necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check if adding days would exceed the number of days in the current month. If so, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n   - For example, adding 7 days to January 1, 2007, should result in January 8, 2007, as January has 31 days.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case in the `add_days` function to handle the transition from December to January of the next year if the addition of days crosses the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules within the `add_days` function to handle the addition of multiple days, decrementing the `Days` count until it reaches zero.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including adding days within the same month, adding days that cross into a new month, and adding days that cross into a new year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from a given date, handling both regular day additions and transitions between months and years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane's appointment, which is three days later from today's date, April 10, 1985. To find the date of the appointment, we need to add three days to today's date. This calculation will result in a date that is three days ahead, which can be determined using date arithmetic.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the addition of days to a given date, considering potential transitions between months and years. In this case, adding three days to April 10 may or may not involve a transition to a new month, depending on the length of April. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments, and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle normal day increments and month-end transitions correctly.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check if adding a day would cause a transition to the next month. For example, adding one day to April 30 should result in May 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case in the `add_days` function to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle February during leap years, ensuring that February has 29 days in such cases.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, decrementing the `Days` counter until it reaches zero.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day increments and month transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.\n\n9. **Calculate Appointment Date:**\n   - Apply the `add_days` function to add three days to today's date (April 10, 1985) to determine the date of Jane's appointment.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date of Jane's appointment, which is three days later from the given date, considering all necessary date transitions and special cases.

For example, if adding three days takes us from April 10 to April 13, the function should recognize that April 13 is within the same month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case in the `add_days` function to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year if the addition of days crosses the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Finding Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to calculate the date for Jane's appointment by adding three days to today's date (April 10, 1985).\n   - Then, use the same function again to find tomorrow's date by adding one more day to the appointment date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day addition based on the current date and the number of days to add.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, crossing month boundaries, and crossing year boundaries.\n   - Verify that the function correctly handles leap years when adding days to dates in February.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date for Jane's appointment and then find the date for tomorrow, considering all necessary date transitions and special cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane's appointment, given that today is April 10, 1985, and her appointment is in three days. This involves two steps: first, calculating the date of Jane's appointment, and then calculating the date 10 days before that appointment. Let's break this down:\n\n- Jane's appointment is three days after April 10, 1985, which means it falls on April 13, 1985.\n- To find the date 10 days before April 13, 1985, we need to subtract 10 days from that date.\n\nSo, the date we are looking for is 10 days before April 13, 1985.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including day subtraction and handling month and year transitions. The key steps are:\n\n1. Calculate Jane's appointment date: April 10 + 3 days = April 13, 1985.\n2. Subtract 10 days from April 13, 1985, considering month and year transitions.\n\nIn Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` to add a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - Handle month and year transitions correctly when adding days. For example, adding 3 days to April 10 should result in April 13.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - Handle month and year transitions when subtracting days. For instance, subtracting 10 days from April 13 should lead to April 3.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding or subtracting days. For example, moving from March 31 to April 1 or from December 31 to January 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which is crucial for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion to implement the day addition and subtraction functions, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied during day addition and subtraction.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions, leap years, and non-leap years.\n   - Verify the functions by checking the results for adding and subtracting different numbers of days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate Jane's appointment date and then determine the date 10 days before that appointment, considering all necessary date arithmetic and transitions.",

This involves understanding how to handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date subtraction involving month and year changes. Subtracting one month from April 10 would typically lead to March 10, 1985.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that today is April 10, 1985, and Jane's appointment is scheduled for three days later. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting days from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days. In this case, subtracting seven days from April 10, 1985, may result in a date in the previous month, March, and potentially the previous year, depending on the number of days in March. Prolog can be used to define rules for date subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle subtraction of days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month and year transitions.\n   - If `DD` is greater than 1, decrement `DD` by 1. Otherwise, decrement `MM` by 1 and reset `DD` to the last day of the previous month, considering leap years for February.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days.\n   - If `MM` becomes 0 (indicating a transition to the previous year), decrement `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to 12 (December) or adjust for leap years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Subtracting Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (7 days) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for day, month, and year subtractions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting 7 days from April 10, 1985.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles subtracting days from various months, including leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date one week ago from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year, and leap years.",

For example, adding 3 days to April 10, 1985, should result in April 13, 1985.\n\n8. **Calculate Jane's Appointment Date:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to calculate the date of Jane's appointment, which is 3 days later than the given date.\n\n9. **Calculate Date 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Use the `increment_day` function to find the date 24 hours (1 day) after Jane's appointment date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours after Jane's appointment, considering all necessary date transitions and handling leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date based on the information that it is Jane's second time seeing a meteor shower this year, and today's date is March 5. From this information, we can deduce that Jane saw a meteor shower earlier in the year and is now seeing another one. Since meteor showers typically occur at specific times of the year, we can assume that a significant amount of time has passed between these two events. Therefore, today's date is likely in a later month, and we can estimate it to be in the second half of the year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the month and day based on the given information. We know that today is March 5, and Jane has seen two meteor showers this year. Meteor showers often occur at specific times of the year, so we can assume that Jane saw the previous meteor shower several months ago. This suggests that today's date is likely in the latter part of the year. We can use Prolog to reason about the timing of meteor showers and the passage of time to estimate today's date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Meteor Shower Occurrence Rules:**\n   - Create rules to represent the occurrence of meteor showers. For example, define a rule `meteor_shower(Month, Day)` to indicate the typical month and day range for meteor showers. This will help establish a timeframe for Jane's first meteor shower sighting.\n\n3. **Reasoning about Time Passage:**\n   - Implement rules to estimate the time that has passed since Jane's first meteor shower sighting. This can be done by considering the typical interval between meteor showers and defining rules for time progression.\n\n4. **Estimating Today's Month and Day:**\n   - Based on the time that has passed since the first meteor shower, use Prolog's reasoning capabilities to estimate the current month and day. This may involve rules for month progression, season estimation, or other temporal reasoning.\n\n5. **Year Confirmation:**\n   - Since the year is given as 1973, include this information in the date structure to confirm the year component of today's date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, such as various meteor shower occurrences, intervals between showers, and potential seasonal transitions.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Prompt the user to input the date of Jane's first meteor shower sighting and any other relevant information.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Use Prolog's search capabilities to estimate and output the most likely date for today based on the given information and the estimated time passage.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that reasons about the timing of meteor showers and the passage of time to estimate today's date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from today's date, March 5, in the year 1973. Jane's second meteor shower viewing of the year serves as a unique reference point. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from March 5, 1973.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting a specified number of days from a given date. The challenge lies in handling the transition between months and years, as subtracting 10 days might take us into the previous month or even year. In this case, we need to consider the number of days in each month and adjust for the transition from February to March, taking into account the varying lengths of February in leap years versus non-leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations involving day, month, and year decrements.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering the transition between months and years.\n   - If subtracting a day results in a date like February 30, adjust it to February 29 in leap years or February 28 in non-leap years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month and year when subtracting days. For example, subtracting 10 days from March 5 should lead to February 25.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during the subtraction process.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10, in this case) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting 10 days from March 5, 1973.\n   - Verify the program's ability to handle various subtraction scenarios, including common days, month-end dates, and leap year dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year, and leap years.",

In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for year subtraction, month adjustments, and handling leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle year subtraction and month/day adjustments.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from the current year. If the current year is a leap year, the previous year may not be, so the day and month should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the month and day after subtracting one year. If the current date is after February 29 in a leap year, the previous year's date should be adjusted to the corresponding date in the non-leap year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling the month and day adjustments correctly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the next, considering any necessary month and day adjustments.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct month and day adjustments based on the current date and whether the current or previous year is a leap year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that span leap years, non-leap years, and various months and days to ensure accurate adjustments.\n\n8. **Calculate Date One Year Ago:**\n   - Given today's date, use the defined rules to calculate the date one year ago, considering any necessary month and day adjustments.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year ago from a given date, handling year transitions, month and day adjustments, and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that today is the second time Jane has seen a meteor shower in the year 1973, and the current date is March 5. This involves calculating a past date by subtracting seven days from the given date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of seven days from a given date, considering the transition between months and years. Since March has 31 days, subtracting seven days will not cross the month boundary. However, we need to consider the transition between years, as the date could potentially fall in the previous year. In Prolog, we can define rules for date subtraction, handling month and year transitions accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Month, Day, Year)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle date arithmetic, including subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering the transition between months and years.\n   - If the day of the month is not the last day, simply decrement the day.\n   - If the day is the last day of the month, decrement the day to the last day of the previous month and decrement the month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from March 5 would result in March 4.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transition:**\n   - Implement a special case for subtracting days that results in a date in the previous year.\n   - If the month and day after subtraction are both less than the current month and day, increment the year by one.\n   - For instance, subtracting seven days from March 5, 2023, would result in February 28, 2023, which is one day short of a full week.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days, repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the subtraction logic with various dates, including those near month and year boundaries, to ensure correct transitions.\n   - Verify the handling of leap years, such as subtracting days from February 29 during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute a date one week ago from a given date, considering transitions between months and years, and accounting for leap years.",

If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should handle the transition to the next month.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Create a rule to check if `DD` is the last day of `MM` (e.g., 31 for May, 30 for June).

        "question": "Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today's date, which is March 5, 1973. This problem involves a simple increment of one day to the current date. Given that it is Jane's second meteor shower observation of the year, there are no specific conditions or transitions to consider for this date adjustment.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the day component of the date by one while ensuring that we do not cross any month or year boundaries. In this case, incrementing one day from March 5 will result in March 6, remaining within the same month and year. The solution will involve defining rules for basic date arithmetic in SWI-Prolog.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to add one day to the input date.\n   - If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment it by one.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, roll over to the first day of the next month, and if necessary, increment the year.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific case, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if `DD` exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month rolls over to January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rule is applied based on the current date, such as incrementing the day, transitioning to the next month, or handling a leap year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `increment_day` rule for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Use the `increment_day` rule to calculate the date 24 hours later from the given date, March 5, 1973.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple SWI-Prolog program that can increment a given date by one day, considering potential month and year transitions, and correctly handle leap years.",

If yesterday was January 21, then today is January 22, 2011. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be January 23, 2011, represented as 01/23/2011 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date. Specifically, we need to add two days to the given date to find tomorrow's date. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation, including adding days, handling month transitions, and considering year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Days, StartDate, EndDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given start date and returns the end date.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. If adding days causes the month to exceed the maximum (e.g., going from January to February), increment the month and reset the day if needed.\n   - Also, handle the transition from December to January for year changes.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct transition rules based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries. For example, adding 31 days to January 1 should result in February 1 of the same year.\n\n8. **Tomorrow's Date Calculation:**\n   - Given the date of yesterday (January 21, 2011), use the `add_days` function with 2 days to calculate today's date (January 22, 2011).\n   - Then, use the same function with 1 day to calculate tomorrow's date (January 23, 2011).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine tomorrow's date based on a given past date, handling month and year transitions and considering leap years.

Prolog can be used to define rules for decrementing days, handling month and year transitions, and managing date boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations for subtracting days from a date.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to subtract one day from a given date.\n   - If `DD` is not the first day of the month, simply decrement it by one.\n   - If `DD` is 1, decrement `MM` by one, and if `MM` becomes 0, set it to 12 (December) and decrement the year by one.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when decrementing days. For example, if today is January 2 and we subtract one day, the result should be December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days. For example, to subtract 10 days, recursively call the `decrement_day` rule ten times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct application of rules for day, month, and year decrements, taking into account month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `decrement_day` rule with various dates, including transitions between months (e.g., January 2 to December 31) and years (e.g., December 31 to December 30 of the previous year).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 10 days prior to a given date, handling month and year transitions and considering the impact of leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply those rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that yesterday's date was January 21, 2011. First, we need to calculate today's date, which is January 22, 2011. Then, adding one week (7 days) to this date, we find that one week from today is January 29, 2011. This date can be represented as 01/29/2011 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval of one week. The key steps are to determine today's date and then add seven days to it, considering any month or year transitions that may occur during this interval. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation and handling month and year boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate today's date based on the given date of yesterday, January 21, 2011. This involves adding one day to the given date.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check for month and year transitions. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the current month, roll over to the next month. If the month is December and the day rolls over, increment the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied for month and year transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `add_days` function for various scenarios, including transitions between months (e.g., January to February), transitions between years (e.g., December 31 to January 1), and leap years (e.g., February 28 to March 1 in a leap year).\n\n8. **Calculate Date One Week from Today:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function with `Days` set to 7 to calculate the date one week from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one week from today, considering month and year transitions and handling leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from June 18, 2019, given that Jane's belief of the date is correct. To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract a month from this date, considering any necessary adjustments for month length and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a month from a given date, which can be challenging due to varying month lengths and potential year transitions. In this case, going one month back from June 18, 2019, would be May 18, 2019. However, we need to consider that May has only 31 days, so we must adjust the day accordingly. The result would be May 18, 2019.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like subtracting a month.\n\n2. **Subtract a Month Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date.

In Prolog, we can define rules for handling day subtraction and month-end transitions to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 19 should result in June 18.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days from the first day of the month. This rule should decrement the month and set the day to the last day of that month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from June 1 should result in May 31.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year. This will be useful for subtracting days across year boundaries.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to another, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for subtracting multiple days if needed.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rule is applied based on the input date, whether it is the first day of the month or not.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover normal day subtraction, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, test subtracting one day from June 19, one day from June 1, and one day from December 31.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date of yesterday based on the given input, handling day subtraction and month-end transitions effectively. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days prior to June 19, 2019, as John correctly identified the date. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from this date. Considering the month and year boundaries, the date 10 days ago would fall in the same month (June) but in the previous year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting 10 days from a given date, which requires handling the transition between months and years correctly. In this case, the subtraction does not span across a month boundary, but it does involve a year transition. Prolog can be used to define rules for decrementing days, handling month-end transitions, and adjusting the year as needed.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements and year adjustments.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering the transition between months and years. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should identify the last day of the previous month and decrement the year if necessary.\n\n3. **Month-End and Year-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes adjusting the month and day values accordingly.\n   - Special handling is needed for December, where the year should also be decremented.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 in this case) has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during a leap year.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.

This will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during year subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to another, considering any necessary adjustments to the month and day values.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including regular year subtractions, leap year adjustments, and cases where the resulting date is in a different month due to the year subtraction.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year prior to a given date, handling year transitions and any necessary adjustments to the month and day values.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that today is June 19, 2019. Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date. Since there are no month or year transitions involved, the date one week ago would simply be June 12, 2019, which can be represented as 06/12/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of seven days from the given date. This requires decrementing the day value while considering potential month and year transitions. In this case, since we are only dealing with a one-week difference, there are no month or year transitions to account for. The solution involves basic date arithmetic and ensuring that the day value is adjusted correctly. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date manipulation and subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the resulting day is 0, then the previous day is the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 19 (06/19/2019) should result in June 18 (06/18/2019).\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not applicable in this specific case, include rules to handle transitions to the previous month and year if the day subtraction results in a negative day value.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to subtract multiple days by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule. This will handle cases where we need to subtract more than one week or a different number of days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during a leap year.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct date manipulation rules are applied based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including normal day subtractions, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of one week (7 days) from various dates, such as June 19, 2019, December 31, 2018, and February 28, 2020 (both leap and non-leap years).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, considering potential transitions between months and years, as well as handling leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the current date, given that Jane feels like May 6, 1992, is like yesterday, but it was actually ten years ago. This means we need to calculate the date that is ten years after May 6, 1992, to find the equivalent date in the present. Adding ten years to 1992 gives us the year 2002, so the equivalent date today would be May 6, 2002, which can be represented as 05/06/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding ten years to a given date while ensuring that the resulting month and day are valid for the new year. In this case, we are adding ten years to May 6, 1992, so we need to consider if May 6 is a valid date in the year 2002. Since May 6 falls within the valid range of dates for the month of May, the resulting date is valid. In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for year addition and date validation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - This function should increment the year by the specified amount and consider the resulting month and day to ensure they are valid for the new year.\n\n3. **Date Validation:**\n   - Implement logic to validate the resulting month and day after adding years. For example, if the original date is February 29, ensure that the resulting year is a leap year, or adjust the day to February 28 for non-leap years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Create a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February dates correctly.\n\n5. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle cases where the resulting month and day exceed the valid range for that month. For example, if adding years results in June 31, adjust the date to July 1.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple years, decrementing the `Years` count until it reaches zero.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date validation and month-end transitions based on the resulting year and date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_years` function with various dates, including February 29 in leap and non-leap years, December 31, and other dates that may require adjustments due to month-end or year-end transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the equivalent date ten years after the given date, handling year additions and date validations effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow based on the information that May 6, 1992, feels like yesterday to Jane, but it was actually ten years ago. This means today's date is ten years after May 6, 2002, which is May 6, 2022. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be May 7, 2022, represented as 05/07/2022 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a given date in the past and a time interval of ten years. The challenge is to correctly increment the year by ten and then add one day to arrive at the date tomorrow. In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including year increments and day increments, while considering month and year boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and days.\n\n2. **Increment Year Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the year (`YYYY`) by a given number. In this case, it should add 10 years to the original year, 1992, resulting in the year 2022.\n\n3. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. If `DD` is the last day of the month, increment the month (`MM`) and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the next month when incrementing days. This logic should consider the number of days in each month and adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Create a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years. If the year is a leap year, adjust the end date of February to 29 days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to apply the day increment rule to calculate the date tomorrow. This will involve applying the rule once to today's date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the desired operation (incrementing years or days).\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from May 31 to June 1 and February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date tomorrow based on a given date in the past, considering the addition of years and days, and handling month and year transitions, including leap years.",

In this case, today's date is ten years ahead of the date Jane perceives as \"yesterday.\"\n\n3. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Define a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) by 1 and handling month and day adjustments due to the year change.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting month and day are valid for the new year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that Jane feels like May 6, 1992, is like yesterday, but it was actually ten years ago. First, we need to calculate the correct date for today based on Jane's perception. Ten years have passed since Jane's reference date, so we need to add ten years to May 6, 1992, which would result in May 6, 2022. Therefore, today's date is May 6, 2022, and the date one week ago would be April 29, 2022, or 04/29/2022 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform two main calculations:\n1. Adjust the given date (May 6, 1992) by adding ten years to it, resulting in the date we perceive as \"today.\"\n2. Calculate the date one week ago from the adjusted \"today\" date.\n\nThe first calculation involves adding ten years to the given date, which is a straightforward adjustment. The second calculation requires handling the transition between months and potentially years when subtracting seven days from the adjusted \"today\" date. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting years, months, and days.\n\n2. **Date Adjustment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to adjust the given date (May 6, 1992) by adding ten years to it. This involves incrementing the year by ten, resulting in May 6, 2022, which is perceived as \"today.\"\n\n3. **Handling Week Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract seven days from the adjusted \"today\" date to find the date one week ago. This rule should handle transitions between months and years, ensuring that the resulting date is accurate.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle month-end and year-end transitions when subtracting days. For example, subtracting seven days from May 6 should result in April 29, considering the transition from April to May.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during date subtractions.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to another, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the date one week ago is calculated accurately.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to dynamically select the appropriate rules based on the input date and the required adjustments.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a week from dates near month-end and year-end boundaries, as well as during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from the adjusted \"today\" date, considering the ten-year difference in Jane's perception.

Therefore, Christmas Eve in 1937 would be December 24, 1937, represented as 12/24/1937 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date of Christmas Eve for a given year.

This rule should be straightforward since Christmas Eve falls on the same date every year.\n\n3. **Year Adjustment:**\n   - Implement a rule to adjust the year based on the input. In this case, the input year is 1937, so the rule should set the year component accordingly.\n\n4. **Date Output:**\n   - Create a rule to format and output the calculated date in the desired MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correctness of the Christmas Eve rule for various years, including leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Design a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a year and receive the date of Christmas Eve for that year.\n\n7. **Handling Invalid Inputs:**\n   - Implement error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as non-numeric or out-of-range years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple SWI-Prolog program that can determine the date of Christmas Eve for any given year.

To find the date of tomorrow, we need to add one day to this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering the month and year boundaries. Since Christmas Eve is on December 24th, adding one day will take us to December 25th, which is Christmas Day. We need to ensure that our calculation correctly identifies this transition and adjusts the date accordingly. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` that adds one day to the input date. If the current day is the last day of the month, the function should set the new date to the first day of the next month and adjust the month accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `increment_day` function to check if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, set the new day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year should also be incremented.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the date is incremented correctly, even across month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the current date. This will allow for dynamic handling of various date scenarios.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.

Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs and provides clear error messages.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date of tomorrow based on the given input, considering month and year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that today is Christmas Eve (December 24) of 1937. Christmas Eve is the day before Christmas, which is celebrated on December 25. Therefore, yesterday would have been December 23, 1937. This date can be represented as 12/23/1937 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one day prior to Christmas Eve in the year 1937. This involves understanding the specific date of Christmas Eve and then subtracting one day from that date. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic operations, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Christmas Eve Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Christmas Eve for a given year. Christmas Eve falls on December 24 each year, so this rule should set `MM` to 12 and `DD` to 24 for any input year.\n\n3. **Day Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day. However, if the day is the first, the rule should set the day to the last day of the previous month and decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year when subtracting days. This will be important for dates near the end of December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Christmas Eve and the subsequent day subtraction. This will allow for the correct application of rules based on the input year.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for Christmas Eve calculation and day subtraction, considering various date boundaries.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates near Christmas Eve, including December 23, December 25, and December 31, to ensure that the day subtraction handles month and year transitions correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date yesterday based on the fact that today is Christmas Eve in 1937, taking into account the specific date of Christmas Eve and handling date arithmetic accordingly.",

To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date, taking into account the transition between years and the varying number of days in different months. In this case, subtracting one year from December 24, 1937, would result in a date in December 1936. However, we need to consider the number of days in December to determine the correct day in that month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for subtracting years.\n\n2. **Handling Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the month and day are within the range of the new year, simply decrement the year.\n\n3. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one year to another, considering the varying number of days in different months. For example, if the original date is December 31, the resulting date in the previous year should be December 31 as well.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for handling February correctly during year subtraction. If the original date is in February and the previous year is a leap year, adjust the day accordingly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to another, considering all necessary adjustments to the month and day.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those near the end and beginning of the year, to ensure correct transitions.

One week from today would be New Year's Eve, December 31, 1937. This date can be represented as 12/31/1937 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one week (7 days) after a given date, considering month and year transitions. In this case, we are dealing with a transition from one month to the next within the same year. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year changes accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations, including day increments and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to calculate the next day's date.\n   - This function should handle month-end and year-end transitions. For example, if `MM` is 12 and `DD` is 31, the next date should be January 1 of the same year.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly until the desired number of days has been added.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `increment_day` to handle transitions between months and years. For instance, if `MM` is 12 and `DD` is incremented beyond 31, `MM` should become 1, `DD` should reset to 1, and the year should remain the same.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate the date one week later by repeatedly applying `add_day` seven times.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct application of rules for day increments, month transitions, and year transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as adding 7 days to December 24, 1937, to ensure the correct transition to December 31, 1937, is made.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one week from a given date, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nGiven that today is Christmas Eve of 1937, we can determine that the current date is December 24, 1937. The task is to find the date 24 hours later, which would be the day after Christmas Eve, i.e., Christmas Day. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is December 25, 1937, or 12/25/1937 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day, taking into account the month and year. Christmas Eve falls on December 24, so there is no concern about transitioning to a new month or year in this specific case. However, the solution should consider these transitions for general applicability. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments and month/year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 24, the next date should be December 25, 1937.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month. For instance, if the date is January 31, the next date should be February 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is already December, and the incremented day exceeds the number of days in December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct date transition rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling both simple day increments and more complex transitions, such as moving between months and years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that today is a palindrome day in the year 2020. A palindrome day in the MMDDYYYY format occurs when the month, day, and year read the same backward and forward, such as 02/02/2020. To find the date yesterday, we need to calculate one day before the palindrome date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the palindrome date in 2020 and then subtract one day from that date. This involves understanding how to manipulate dates and perform basic arithmetic operations on them. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation and use built-in arithmetic functions to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Identify Palindrome Date:**\n   - Write a rule to identify the palindrome date in the year 2020. For example, `is_palindrome_date(date(MM, DD, 2020))` should succeed if `MM` and `DD` are the same.\n\n3. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_one_day(Date, NewDate)` to calculate the date one day before a given date. This rule should handle the transition between months and years correctly.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `subtract_one_day` to check if the day is the first day of the month (or year) and adjust the month (or year) accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct date manipulation rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various dates, including transitions between months and years, to ensure that the `subtract_one_day` rule works correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can identify the palindrome date in 2020 and then calculate the date yesterday, taking into account month and year transitions and handling leap years correctly.",

In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - If `DD` becomes 0, decrement `MM` and set `DD` to the last day of the previous month, considering leap years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `subtract_days` to handle transitions between months and years.

        "question": "This is the last day of 1899. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that it is the last day of 1899. Since the year is not specified as either December 31, 1899, or another date that could be the last day of the year, we need to account for both cases. Therefore, today's date could either be December 31, 1899, or the last day of another month in 1899, such as January 31, February 28, etc.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider two possible scenarios: one in which the last day of 1899 refers to December 31, and another in which it refers to the last day of another month. This requires understanding how to calculate dates within a given year and handling month-end transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to determine the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like incrementing months and days.\n\n2. **Base Case for Last Day of December:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the scenario where the last day of 1899 refers to December 31. This case can be represented as `date(12, 31, 1899)`.\n\n3. **Recursive Cases for Other Months:**\n   - Write recursive rules to handle cases where the last day of 1899 refers to the last day of other months. For example, if it were the last day of January, it would be `date(1, 31, 1899)`.\n   - These rules should consider the varying number of days in each month and adjust `DD` accordingly.\n\n4. **Handling February in Leap Years:**\n   - Implement a special case for February in leap years. If 1899 was a leap year, the last day of February would be February 29, so include this as a possible case.\n\n5. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly handling February in 1899.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find the correct date representation based on the provided information.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates that could be the last day of 1899, including December 31, January 31, February 28, and February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine today's date based on the given information, considering the possibility of different months' last days and handling leap years.",

Since we don't have a specific month and day, we need to consider all possible scenarios for the last day of 1899: December 31, September 30, June 30, or any other month-end date. Tomorrow's date will depend on which month we are currently in.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to the next and potentially from one year to the next. This involves understanding month lengths and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage these transitions effectively, ensuring that we cover all possible cases for the last day of 1899.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day and month increments, as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Base Cases for Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Write rules for each possible month-end date in 1899: December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, etc. These rules will handle the transition to the next month or year.\n\n3. **Recursive Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. This rule should handle cases where we are not at the month's end.\n\n4. **Handling Year Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31, 1899, to January 1, 1900, considering the year increment.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Since 1899 is not a leap year, we don't need to handle February 29 for this specific case. However, include a general rule for leap year detection to handle other scenarios.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct month-end base case based on the current date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from the last day of 1899. Since it is the last day of the year, it is safe to assume that the date is December 31, 1899. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting 10 days from a given date, which may require handling transitions between months and years. In this case, subtracting 10 days from December 31, 1899, would take us back to December 21, 1899. The solution requires understanding month lengths and adjusting for the transition from one month to another. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations involving day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month and year transitions. If `DD` is 1, then subtracting a day should result in the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, subtracting a day from January 1 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, 10 days) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1 or December 31, and during leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 10 days prior to the last day of 1899, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, which is the last day of 1899 (December 31, 1899). To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date, which would result in December 31, 1898.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a year from a given date, which requires handling the transition from one year to the previous one. In this case, the transition is straightforward since it does not involve any month or day adjustments. However, we need to ensure that the date representation and subtraction logic can handle this operation effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting years.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from the given date. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) by 1 while keeping the month and day intact.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific case, include logic to handle adjustments to the month and day when subtracting a year, especially for dates near the end of a month or in leap years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle more complex date calculations, such as subtracting multiple years or handling dates near month or year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the input date, especially when considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting a year, including cases near the end of a month or during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year prior to a given date, handling year transitions and considering potential adjustments to the month and day.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from the last day of 1899, assuming you mean December 31, 1899. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from this date. However, since there are no specific conditions or transitions mentioned, we can simply subtract 7 days to get to the desired date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a number of days (7) from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days, especially when crossing the boundary from one year to another. In this case, since we are starting from December 31, and subtracting 7 days will not take us into a different month or year, the calculation is relatively straightforward.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations for subtracting days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month and year transitions. For example, if `DD` is 31 and `MM` is not 12 (December), then the previous day should be `DD - 1` with the same `MM`. However, if `MM` is 12, then the previous month should be 11 (November), and `DD` should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month and year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing `MM` and `YYYY` accordingly when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during subtraction.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules for day, month, and year subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or December 31st.\n   - Verify the program handles various subtraction scenarios, including 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering transitions between days, months, and years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from today's date, which is June 2, 1943, given that a concert was delayed by one day from its original schedule of June 1, 1943. To find the date one month ago, we need to go back one month from the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date one month prior to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and potentially years, especially when crossing month boundaries. In this case, going back one month from June 2, 1943, would be May 2, 1943. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation and handle these transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from June 2, 1943, should result in May 2, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid when subtracting a month. If the resulting date lands on a day that doesn't exist in the target month (e.g., February 30), adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling February during month subtraction. If the original date is in February and it's a leap year, the resulting date should be February 29 in a non-leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date one month ago. This will involve applying the month subtraction rule and checking for any necessary adjustments.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will help in handling various month transitions accurately.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for month subtraction across different months, including end-of-year transitions (e.g., from January to December) and leap years (e.g., February in leap and non-leap years).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month prior to a given date, considering month transitions and handling special cases like leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today's date, which is June 2, 1943. This calculation involves a simple increment of one day from the given date, which results in June 3, 1943. This date can be represented as 06/03/1943 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a basic increment of the day component of the given date, taking into account the number of days in the month to ensure the resulting date is valid. In this case, June has 30 days, so incrementing one day from June 2, 1943, remains within the same month and year. Prolog can handle this with rules for date manipulation and checking for valid date ranges.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. If the resulting day is within the valid range for the month, the rule should apply.\n   - For example, incrementing one day from June 2, 1943, should yield June 3, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This rule should adjust the month and reset the day accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule for handling the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds December. This rule should increment the year and reset the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years. This rule should adjust the end date of February to the 29th during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct number of days is added even when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will allow for flexible and accurate date manipulation.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from June 30 to July 1, from December 31 to January 1, and from February 28 to March 1 in both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of computing the date 24 hours later from a given input date, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions.

This simple subtraction will yield the correct date for today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date one day prior to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between days correctly, especially considering the month and year boundaries. In this case, subtracting one day from July 9 falls within the same month, so there are no month or year transitions to worry about. Prolog can be used to define rules for day subtraction and handling potential month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations like day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from July 9, 1972, should result in July 8, 1972.\n\n3. **Handling First Day of Month:**\n   - Include a condition to check if the day is the first of the month. If so, the subtraction should result in the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from July 1, 1972, should yield June 30, 1972.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific case, include rules to handle transitions to the previous month and year if the day subtraction crosses month or year boundaries.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling February during day subtractions.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering potential month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct rule is applied based on the input date, whether it is the first day of the month or not.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for day subtractions within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that Jane scheduled appointments for tomorrow, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To find the date of yesterday, we simply need to subtract one day from the given date. Therefore, the date yesterday was July 8, 1972, represented as 07/08/1972 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting one day from a given date, taking into account the month and year. In this case, the transition is within the same month, so there are no special considerations for month or year changes. The key is to ensure that the day subtraction logic correctly handles the transition from one day to the previous day within the same month. In SWI-Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date manipulation and handling day decrements.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day (`DD`) from a given date. If the resulting day is 0, then decrement the month and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes checking the number of days in the previous month and adjusting the day and month accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case for the transition from January to December of the previous year when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling February during day subtractions. If the year is a leap year, February has 29 days; otherwise, it has 28 days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will help in automatically choosing the right path for day subtraction.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including normal day subtractions, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, test subtracting one day from July 9, January 1, and February 28 in both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date of yesterday based on the given input, handling day subtractions and month transitions correctly.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Tuesday, July 9, 1972, given that Jane has scheduled appointments for that day. To find the date 10 days in the past, we need to subtract 10 days from July 9, 1972.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is 10 days prior to a given date, which includes handling the transition between months and potentially years. In this case, subtracting 10 days from July 9, 1972, would bring us back to the end of June. Prolog can be used to handle this calculation by defining rules for decrementing days and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can accommodate operations like day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should adjust to the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from July 1 should result in June 30.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Develop logic to manage the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This requires knowledge of the number of days in each month and appropriate adjustments to the month and day values.\n   - Special cases, such as months with varying lengths (e.g., February) and leap years, should be considered.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Create a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 in this case) have been subtracted.\n   - This approach handles subtracting any number of days, seamlessly navigating through month and year boundaries.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is essential for accurately handling February during leap years. This rule should adjust the number of days in February accordingly.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently identify and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the recursive subtraction process follows the right path to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or dates during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Validate the program's ability to handle various numbers of days for subtraction, including 1 day, 10 days, and dates spanning multiple months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of determining the date 10 days prior to a given date, effectively handling transitions between months and years, and considering special cases like leap years.",

        "question": "Jane scheduled 3 apointments with 5 poeple for tomorrow (Tue, 7/9/1972). What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from July 9, 1972, given that Jane has scheduled appointments for tomorrow with a group of people. To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from July 9, 1972, which would result in June 9, 1972. This date can be represented as 06/09/1972 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one month from a given date, taking into account any month-end and year transitions that may occur. In this case, subtracting one month from July leads us to June. However, we need to consider the number of days in June to ensure that the day component of the date is adjusted correctly. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, month subtraction, and handling month-end and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting a month.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, then subtracting a month should result in December of the previous year. For other months, simply decrement the month value.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day component when subtracting a month. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December of one year to November of the previous year when subtracting a month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the month subtraction, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including month-end transitions, year transitions, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To calculate the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current year, 1972, resulting in the year 1971. Then, we need to consider the month and day of today's date and determine the corresponding date in the previous year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date, taking into account the varying number of days in different months and the transition between years. In this case, subtracting one year from July 9, 1972, would result in a date in July 1971. However, we need to consider the number of days in July and adjust the day and month accordingly. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, including year subtraction and month-day adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for subtracting years, months, and days.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the current year is not a leap year, the rule should simply decrement the year by 1. If it is a leap year, special handling may be needed for the transition from February 29 to February 28.\n\n3. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the month and day components of the date after subtracting one year. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day, the day should be set to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define rules to handle transitions between months, considering the varying number of days in different months. For example, subtracting one year from January 31 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for correctly handling the transition from February 29 to February 28 during year subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the subtraction of one year, considering month-end and leap year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date and whether it is a leap year.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including regular year subtraction, leap year subtraction, and month-end transitions. For example, subtracting one year from July 9, 2020 (a leap year), should result in July 9, 2019.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one year ago from a given date, considering month and year transitions, as well as leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today's date, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date. Given that today is July 9, 1972, the date one week ago would be July 2, 1972, represented as 07/02/1972 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days from a given date, taking into account any month or year transitions that may occur. In this case, subtracting 7 days from July 9 falls within the same month (July) and year (1972), so there are no month or year transitions to consider. However, we still need to handle the decrement of days correctly. In Prolog, we can define rules for day subtraction and month-end transitions to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition from the last day of the month to the first day of the next month. For example, if `DD` is 31 and `MM` is not 12 (December), then the next date should have `MM` incremented by 1 and `DD` reset to 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year. If `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, then the next date should have `YYYY` incremented by 1, `MM` reset to 1 (January), and `DD` reset to 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days (in this case, 7 days). The rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries. Verify that the program correctly handles both regular and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, taking into account day subtraction and any necessary month or year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the given date, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To find the date 24 hours later, we simply need to add one day to this date, resulting in Wednesday, July 10, 1972. This date can be represented as 07/10/1972 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the day component of the given date by one, taking into account the month and year. In this case, July has 31 days, so adding one day will not cause a transition to the next month. However, we should consider the possibility of crossing into the next month or year in general cases. SWI-Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, handling day increments, and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering the number of days in the given month. If the resulting day is greater than the maximum days in the month, carry over to the next month.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day increment causes an overflow. This rule should increment the month (`MM`) and reset the day (`DD`) to the appropriate value for the new month.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year when the month increment causes an overflow (e.g., transitioning from December to January). This rule should increment the year (`YYYY`) and reset the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day increments, month transitions, year transitions, and leap years. For example, test cases could include July 9 to July 10, December 31 to January 1, and February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling both regular day increments and month/year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to extract the date from a given timestamp, \"3:02 pm of 5/4/2004.\" The date portion of the timestamp is \"5/4/2004,\" which represents May 4, 2004, in MM/DD/YYYY format. Therefore, the answer to the question \"What is the date today?\" is 05/04/2004.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves recognizing and parsing the date information from a given timestamp. The timestamp includes the time (3:02 pm) and the date (5/4/2004). The goal is to extract the month, day, and year components from the date portion of the timestamp. In Prolog, we can use pattern matching and string manipulation functions to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Input Representation:**\n   - Define a structure to represent the input timestamp, including separate fields for time and date. For example, `timestamp(time(Hour, Minute), date(MM, DD, YYYY))`.\n\n2. **Date Extraction:**\n   - Write a rule to extract the date components (month, day, and year) from the input timestamp. You can use string manipulation functions like `sub_string/5` to extract the month, day, and year from the date string \"5/4/2004.\"\n\n3. **Date Validation:**\n   - Implement a validation rule to check if the extracted date components are valid. For example, ensure that the month is within the range of 1 to 12, the day is valid for the given month, and the year is a positive integer.\n\n4. **Date Formatting:**\n   - Define a rule to format the extracted date components into the desired MM/DD/YYYY format. This may involve padding single-digit months and days with a leading zero.\n\n5. **Output the Date:**\n   - Write a query that takes the input timestamp, extracts the date components, and outputs the formatted date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various input timestamps to ensure that the date extraction, validation, and formatting work correctly. For example, test cases could include timestamps like \"10:30 am of 1/1/2023,\" \"5:45 pm of 12/31/1999,\" etc.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a timestamp and receives the extracted date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can extract and validate date information from a given timestamp, ensuring accurate and consistent date formatting.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given the current local time and date as 3:02 PM on May 4, 2004. To find the date tomorrow, we simply need to add one day to the current date, considering any month or year transitions that may occur. In this case, adding one day will result in a date of May 5, 2004, which can be represented as 05/05/2004 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the addition of one day to the current date, taking into account any month or year transitions that may occur. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately. We need to consider the length of each month and handle cases where the addition of one day may result in a transition to the next month or even the next year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM)` to represent the current date and time. This structure allows for handling both date and time components.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `add_one_day(datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM), NewDatetime)` to add one day to the current date and time. If `DD` is not the last day of `MM`, simply increment `DD` by one. If `DD` is the last day of the month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1, also checking for year transitions if `MM` is December.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_one_day` rule to handle transitions between months and years. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, increment the year and set `MM` to January and `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Time Component Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the time component (`HH` and `MM`) remains unchanged when adding one day.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the `add_one_day` rule based on the current date and time structure. This will ensure that the correct transitions are made when adding one day.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the correctness of the `add_one_day` rule for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday based on the current local time, which is 3:02 PM on May 4, 2004. To find the date yesterday, we simply need to subtract one day from the given date. Therefore, the date yesterday was May 3, 2004, which can be represented as 05/03/2004 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one day from a given date, taking into account potential month and year transitions. In this case, subtracting one day from May 4 does not cross any month or year boundaries, so the solution is straightforward. However, in general, we need to consider these transitions and adjust the month and year accordingly. SWI-Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation and subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition from the first day of the month to the last day of the previous month. For example, if `DD` is 1, then the previous day would be the last day of the previous month (`MM` decremented by 1).\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year if the day subtraction crosses the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as subtracting a day within the same month, crossing a month boundary, and crossing a year boundary.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date yesterday based on the input date, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions.

Otherwise, decrement the month and reset the day to the last day of the new month, potentially adjusting the year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months, taking into account the varying number of days in each month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from May 4, 2004, at 3:02 pm. To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from this date, considering any month and year transitions that may occur. Given that there are 30 days in April, the date one month ago would be April 4, 2004, represented as 04/04/2004 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one month from a given date, taking into account any transitions between months and years. In this case, the transition occurs within the same year, but we should also consider scenarios where the transition might span across years. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, including month subtraction and handling month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for date and time, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(HH, MM, SS)`.\n   - Ensure that the date structure can handle month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to subtract one month from a given date. If `MM` is not 1 (January), decrement it by 1. If `MM` is 1, set it to 12 (December) and decrement the year by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_month` rule, include logic to adjust the day (`DD`) if the resulting month has fewer days than the original day. For example, if the original date is May 31, the new date should be April 30.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate `leap_year(YYYY)` to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Date Manipulation Functions:**\n   - Provide functions to extract and modify components of the date structure, such as `month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), MM)` to extract the month.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the `subtract_month` rule based on the current month and year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from the given date and time: 3:02 PM on May 4, 2004. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the given year, 2004, resulting in the year 2003. Therefore, the date one year ago would be May 4, 2003, represented as 05/04/2003 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date, taking into account any potential month and day adjustments that may arise due to the varying number of days in different months and leap years. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date manipulation, including year subtraction, and handling month and day transitions accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for date and time, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(Hour, Minute, Second)`.\n   - Ensure that the date structure can handle year subtraction and any necessary adjustments to the month and day.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the month and day of the resulting date are valid for that month, simply decrement the year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the resulting month and day are invalid for the new year. For example, if the original date is February 29 in a leap year, the resulting date in a non-leap year should be February 28 or March 1.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to another, considering any necessary adjustments to the month and day.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date and year subtraction.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including regular year subtractions, transitions from leap years to non-leap years, and handling different months and days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one year prior to a given date, taking into account any necessary adjustments due to month and day variations and leap years. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation, year subtraction, and handling transitions effectively using SWI-Prolog's capabilities.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from the given date and time, which is 3:02 PM on May 4, 2004. To find the date one week later, we need to add 7 days to the current date while considering the time component as well. Since there are 24 hours in a day, adding 7 days will result in a time of 3:02 PM on May 11, 2004, which can be represented as 05/11/2004 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date and time based on a given date and time.

This function should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n3. **Adjust Time Function:**\n   - Create a function `adjust_time(time(HH, MM, SS), NewTime)` that adds the time component (in hours) corresponding to the added days. For example, if 7 days are added, the time should be adjusted by 7*24 hours.\n\n4. **Combine Date and Time:**\n   - Implement a function `combine_date_time(date(MM, DD, YYYY), time(HH, MM, SS), CombinedDateTime)` to merge the date and time components into a single structure.\n\n5. **Handle Time Wrap-Around:**\n   - Include logic to handle time wrap-around when adding hours.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the given time and date, which is 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add a full day to the current date, considering the time as well. Adding 24 hours to 3:02 pm on May 4, 2004, would result in 3:02 pm on May 5, 2004. Therefore, the date 24 hours later, excluding the time, would be May 5, 2004, represented as 05/05/2004 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a full day to a given date and time while handling the transition between days correctly. The key is to ensure that the addition of 24 hours does not affect the time component, and that the date is incremented correctly, taking into account month and year boundaries. In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for date and time manipulation, as well as checking for month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for date and time, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(HH, MM, SS)`.\n   - Ensure that the structures can handle arithmetic operations for adding 24 hours and date transitions.\n\n2. **Add 24 Hours Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_24_hours(Date, Time, NewDate, NewTime)` that adds 24 hours to the given date and time.\n   - This function should handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month and year boundaries.\n\n3. **Date Increment Rule:**\n   - Within the `add_24_hours` function, implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day is the last day of the current month. For example, if the date is May 31, the new date should be June 1.\n\n5. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to a new year if the date is December 31.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Time Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the time component remains consistent when adding 24 hours. If the time exceeds 24:00, it should roll over to the next day.\n\n8. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering all necessary date and time transitions.\n\n9. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to select the correct transition rules based on the current date and time.\n\n10. **Test Cases:**\n    - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding 24 hours to dates at the end of a month or year, during leap years, and with different time components.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date and time 24 hours later from a given input, handling all necessary date and time transitions and special cases.",

The description mentions the day (\"second day\"), the month (\"third month\"), and the year (\"1966\").

If the input year is only two digits, provide a rule to convert it to a four-digit format.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different input descriptions to ensure that the parsing and date construction logic works correctly.

This rule should increment `Month` and reset `Day` to 1.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if `Month` is December and `Day` is 31. This rule should increment `Year` and reset `Month` and `Day` accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific date, consider adding a rule to check for leap years, which would affect the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `increment_day` rule with various dates, including month-end dates (e.g., March 31) and year-end dates (e.g., December 31) to ensure correct transitions.\n\n8. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Given today's date as `date(2, 3, 1966)`, use the `increment_day` rule to calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine tomorrow's date based on the given description of today's date. The program will handle day increments and month and year transitions, ensuring accurate date manipulation in SWI-Prolog.",

This can be represented as 03/01/1966 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple subtraction of one day from a given date.

In Prolog, we can handle this with a rule that decrements the day and checks for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 2, then the previous date should be March 1, 1966.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month if the current day is the first day of the month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date represented by \"9/7\" in the context of Jane watching NFL 2003. Since the format \"month/day\" is commonly used for dates, we can interpret \"9/7\" as September 7. Additionally, the reference to NFL 2003 suggests that the year is indeed 2003. Therefore, the date represented by \"9/7\" in this context is September 7, 2003, or 09/07/2003 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to interpret the given information \"9/7\" as a date in the format MM/DD and then combine it with the year information from \"NFL 2003.\" This involves understanding the context and applying the correct format for representing dates.

For example, check if the month is between 1 and 12, and the day is within the valid range for the given month and leap year considerations.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**\n   - Include error handling for cases where the input format is incorrect or the extracted components are invalid.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday based on the given information: \"Today is 9/7, and Jane is watching NFL 2003.\" From this, we can deduce that the current date is September 7, 2003, and we need to calculate the date one day prior to this.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one day from the given date, considering the transition between months and years if necessary. In this case, since September 6, 2003, is within the same month and year, we don't need to worry about crossing any boundaries. The solution involves a simple day decrement.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day from the given date. If `DD` is not 1, then the previous day is found by decrementing `DD` by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule to handle transitions between months. If `DD` is 1, then the previous day is the last day of the previous month, so decrement `MM` and adjust `DD` accordingly.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Similarly, include a rule to handle transitions between years if the date crosses December 31. If the month is January and `DD` is subtracted, decrement `YYYY` and set `MM` to 12.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rule is applied based on the current date structure when subtracting a day.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various dates to ensure that the day subtraction works correctly, including transitions between months and years, and handling leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one day prior to a given date, considering potential transitions between days, months, and years.",

If the day is the first of the month, the rule should adjust the month and day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days.

The key is to ensure that the day subtraction logic correctly handles the transition between months if needed.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day subtraction operations.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to subtract one day from a given date. If `DD` is greater than 1, decrement it by 1. Otherwise, if it is 1, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `subtract_day` to handle the transition between months. If `MM` becomes 0 (representing December of the previous year), set it to 11 (November) and decrement the year by 1.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Consider adding logic to handle year transitions if the date spans multiple years, though it is not necessary for this specific problem.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that repeatedly calls `subtract_day` until `Days` reaches 0. This will handle subtracting any number of days, including across month boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct transition logic is applied when subtracting days, especially when crossing month boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and potentially across year boundaries, though the latter is not relevant for this specific problem.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week ago from a given date, handling standard day subtraction and month transitions effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today's date, September 7, during the NFL 2003 season. This involves a simple increment of one day to the current date. Since there are no specific conditions or transitions mentioned, we can assume a regular day increment within the same month and year. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be September 8, 2003, or 09/08/2003 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a basic understanding of date manipulation, specifically incrementing the day component of a date by one. In SWI-Prolog, we can represent dates using a structure like `date(Month, Day, Year)` and define rules to perform operations on these date structures. The plan will outline the steps to create a SWI-Prolog code prompt for this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Month, Day, Year)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(date(M, D, Y), date(NewM, NewD, NewY))` to increment the day component of a date by one.\n   - If the resulting day (`NewD`) exceeds the maximum number of days in the month (`NewM`), carry over to the next month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific case, include rules to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if incrementing the day causes the day to exceed the maximum for the current month, increment the month and reset the day to the first of that new month.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Consider rules for handling year transitions when incrementing days near the end of December. If the month is December, and the resulting day and month exceed their limits, increment the year and reset the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases to validate the `increment_day` rule, including scenarios where the day increment causes a transition to a new month or year.\n\n7. **Applying the Rule:**\n   - Given the date \"today,\" use the `increment_day` rule to calculate the date 24 hours later.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that today cannot be December 32, 1929, because there are only 31 days in December. This means that if today is not December 32, then yesterday must have been December 31, 1929. Therefore, the date yesterday was 12/31/1929.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding the concept of date boundaries and performing a simple subtraction of one day from the given date. In this case, we need to consider the month-end boundary, as the date cannot be December 32 due to the fixed number of days in December. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle date arithmetic, taking into account month boundaries and performing day subtractions accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Boundary:**\n   - Write a rule that checks if the current date is at the end of a month (e.g., `DD` is the last day of `MM`). If so, the previous day should be calculated by decrementing `DD` by 1 and potentially adjusting `MM` for months with fewer days.\n\n3. **Normal Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule for subtracting a day from a date when it is not at the end of the month. This rule should simply decrement `DD` by 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case for handling the transition from December to January when subtracting days, ensuring that the year is decremented correctly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not relevant for the given date, consider adding logic to handle leap years, which would affect the number of days in February during a leap year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as subtracting a day from a date at the end of a month, at the end of a year, and during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date \"yesterday\" based on the input date, taking into account month boundaries and performing day subtractions accordingly.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date ten days ago from today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. This calculation involves subtracting ten days from today's date, which is January 1, 1930. Since there are no month or year transitions within this ten-day period, the calculation is straightforward. Ten days ago from January 1, 1930, would be December 22, 1929.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract ten days from a given date, considering the possibility of crossing month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation does not involve any such transitions, but the logic should be designed to handle them in general. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these subtractions and boundary conditions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations for subtracting days.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a single day from the date, considering month and year boundaries. If `DD` is 1, then subtracting a day should result in the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should be decremented.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next when subtracting days. For example, if `MM` is January and `DD` is 1, subtracting a day should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, ten days) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process, ensuring proper transitions between days, months, and years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that validate the correct date calculation when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date ten days ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

Given that yesterday was December 31, 1929, today's date is deduced as January 1, 1930. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from today's date, which is one day after November 23, 1933. To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract a month from November 24, 1933. This calculation involves handling the transition from one month to another, potentially crossing over a year boundary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires subtracting a month from a given date, which can be complex due to varying month lengths and the possibility of crossing a year boundary. In this case, subtracting a month from November 24, 1933, would result in a date in October 1933. However, we need to consider that October has only 31 days, so we must also subtract a few days from the final date. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for month subtraction and handling date adjustments within months.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle operations involving month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a month from a given date. If the month is January, the rule should handle the transition to December of the previous year.\n   - For example, subtracting a month from November 24 should result in October 24, 1933.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to adjust the day within the new month if the original day does not exist in that month. This rule should consider the number of days in the new month and adjust the day accordingly.\n   - For instance, since October has only 31 days, the date should be adjusted to October 31, 1933.\n\n4. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between years when subtracting months. If the new month falls in the previous year, decrement the year accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering day adjustments and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct rules to apply based on the current date and the target month.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month boundaries, such as subtracting a month from January or February during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles cases where the day needs to be adjusted within the new month, such as subtracting a month from dates like November 30 or March 31.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date one month ago from a given date, considering month transitions, day adjustments, and year changes. This will involve defining rules for month subtraction, day adjustments, and handling special cases, ensuring accurate date calculations.",

If so, adjust the month and day accordingly, considering the number of days in each month.\n   - Special handling is needed for December to January transitions, where the year should also increment.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct application of rules for day addition, month transitions, and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various dates, including those near the end of a month or year, to ensure correct transitions.\n   - Verify the function handles leap years correctly, such as adding days to February 28, 2020, which should result in February 29, 2020.\n\n8. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Given the day before yesterday, use the `add_days` function to add 2 days to find today's date.\n\n9. **Calculate Date One Week from Today:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function again to add 7 days to today's date, finding the date one week from today.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate dates a certain number of days in the future, considering month and year transitions and handling leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that it is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. This means that today is the fourth Thursday within the month of November in the year 2001. To find today's date, we need to identify the date that corresponds to this description.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of the fourth Thursday in November for a given year (2001). This involves counting Thursdays in November and identifying the fourth occurrence. In SWI-Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to iterate through the days of November, checking for Thursdays, and keeping track of the count.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure will be used to keep track of the current date as we iterate through November.\n\n2. **Finding Thursdays:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a given date is a Thursday. For example, `is_thursday(date(11, 22, 2001))` should succeed, indicating that November 22, 2001, is a Thursday.\n\n3. **Iterating Through November:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to iterate through the days of November, starting from the first day (November 1).\n   - Within this rule, use Prolog's built-in comparison and arithmetic functions to increment the day and year to navigate through the month.\n\n4. **Counting Thursdays:**\n   - Within the iteration rule, include a counter that increments each time a Thursday is encountered.\n   - Reset the counter if the month changes to December, ensuring that only Thursdays in November are counted.\n\n5. **Stopping Condition:**\n   - The iteration rule should stop when the fourth Thursday is found. This can be achieved by using Prolog's `cut` mechanism to prune unnecessary search paths once the fourth Thursday is reached.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic for finding the fourth Thursday in November for various years, including leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - Once the fourth Thursday is found, the current `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure will represent today's date, which is the US Thanksgiving of 2001.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can calculate the date of the fourth Thursday in November (US Thanksgiving) for a given year. This involves iterating through the days of November, counting Thursdays, and stopping when the fourth one is found. The final date structure will represent today's date, providing the answer to the original question.",

For example, `is_thanksgiving(date(11, DD, 2001))` should yield `date(11, 22, 2001)` as today's date.\n\n4. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to add one day to a given date, handling month and year transitions correctly.\n\n5. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `increment_day` rule, include logic to roll over to the next month if the current day is the last day of the month.\n   - Also, handle the transition to a new year if the current month is December.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify and apply the correct rules for date manipulation, such as identifying Thanksgiving and incrementing the day.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `is_thanksgiving` rule for various years to ensure it correctly identifies the fourth Thursday of November.\n   - Verify the `increment_day` rule for transitions between months and years, including leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine tomorrow's date based on the rule for US Thanksgiving and then perform a simple day increment. This involves defining rules for date manipulation and using Prolog's pattern matching to apply those rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of yesterday, given that today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. In the US, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. This means that Thanksgiving falls on the Thursday that is at least 22 days into November, ensuring it is the fourth Thursday of the month. To find the date of yesterday, we need to calculate the date one day before Thanksgiving.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date based on a specific rule (fourth Thursday of November) and then subtracting one day from that calculated date. The challenge is to correctly identify the fourth Thursday of November and then handle the subtraction of a single day, which may involve a transition between months. Prolog can be used to define rules for identifying Thanksgiving and then subtracting a day from that date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day and month arithmetic.\n\n2. **Identify Thanksgiving Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `is_thanksgiving(date(11, DD, YYYY))` to identify if a given date is the US Thanksgiving.\n   - This rule should check if `DD` is a Thursday and if there are at least 22 days in November leading up to that Thursday, ensuring it is the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Calculate Thanksgiving Date:**\n   - Implement a predicate `calculate_thanksgiving(YYYY, ThanksgivingDate)` that finds the date of US Thanksgiving for a given year.\n   - This predicate should use the `is_thanksgiving` rule to search for the correct date within November of the specified year.\n\n4. **Subtract a Day:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to calculate the date one day before a given date.\n   - This rule should handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end and year-end boundaries.\n\n5. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_day` rule, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, subtracting a day from November 1 should result in October 31.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find the correct date for US Thanksgiving within a given year and to apply the day subtraction logic correctly.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `calculate_thanksgiving` predicate for various years, ensuring it correctly identifies the fourth Thursday of November as Thanksgiving.\n   - Verify that the `subtract_day` rule works for different dates, including month-end and year-end transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of US Thanksgiving for a given year and then calculate the date one day before that Thanksgiving.

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to calculate the date difference and apply it to today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting a certain number of days from a given date. The challenge is to handle the month and year transitions correctly, especially when crossing over from one month to another or from one year to the next.

        "question": "In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, which is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. Given that Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, today's date is November 22, 2001. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting one year from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between years correctly, especially when the date falls within the early part of the year, before the anniversary date. In this case, subtracting one year from November 22, 2001, would result in a date in November 2000. However, since Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday, we need to consider the possibility of moving back to the previous month (October) if the fourth Thursday falls earlier in November.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations involving the subtraction of years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Years:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) by 1 and considering the transition back to the previous month if necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month and adjust the day accordingly when subtracting years. This is especially important for months with varying numbers of days, such as February in leap years.\n\n4. **Calculate Thanksgiving Date:**\n   - Develop a function to calculate the date of US Thanksgiving for a given year. This function should determine the fourth Thursday of November, considering the possibility of falling back into October.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Subtraction:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple years, if needed. This will involve repeatedly applying the single-year subtraction rule.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during year subtraction.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to identify and apply the correct rules for year subtraction, month transitions, and day adjustments.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that span across month and year boundaries, such as subtracting one year from January 1st or November 30th.\n   - Verify the program's ability to handle the subtraction of multiple years, such as subtracting 5 years or 10 years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date one year prior to a given date, considering the unique aspect of Thanksgiving falling on the fourth Thursday of November. This will involve defining rules for year subtraction, handling month and day transitions, and applying these rules recursively to achieve the desired date calculation.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today's date, which is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. Thanksgiving in the US falls on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be November 23, 2001, represented as 11/23/2001 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is one day after a given date. This involves incrementing the day component of the date while considering month and year boundaries. In this case, we are dealing with a date in November, so there is no need to worry about transitioning to a new month or year. However, we should still consider the possibility of crossing the year boundary in other cases. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation to handle this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 11 (November) and `DD` is 22, the next date should be November 23, 2001.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific case, include a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Similarly, include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds 12. This would involve resetting the month to 1 and incrementing the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is October 16, 1924. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date, which means going back to October 16, 1923. This date can be represented as 10/16/1923 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year component of the date by one while ensuring that the month and day values remain consistent. In this case, the month and day values (October 16) are valid for both the original date and the date one year ago, so no adjustments are needed within the month. Prolog can be used to define rules for year subtraction and handling date boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for subtracting years.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year component (`YYYY`) by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Day and Month Consistency:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting day and month combination is valid for the new year. If the resulting date is in a month with fewer days (e.g., subtracting a year from January 31), adjust the day and month accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years. If the original date is February 29 in a leap year, the resulting date in a non-leap year should be February 28.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the next, considering any necessary adjustments to the day and month.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the year subtraction logic with various dates, including those near the end of the year (e.g., December 31) and during leap years (e.g., February 29, 2020).\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date one year prior.

This includes checking if the resulting day is less than 1, in which case the month should be decremented, and the day should be set to the last day of the new month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case for subtracting days from January, which may require decrementing the year and rolling over to December of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Consider leap years when subtracting days from February, as February has 29 days in a leap year and 28 days otherwise.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to handle the subtraction of multiple days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the given date, which is October 16, 1924, at 11 am. Adding 24 hours to this date and time would result in the same time on the following day, October 17, 1924, at 11 am. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is 10/17/1924.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to add 24 hours to the given date and time while ensuring that the date rolls over to the next day at midnight. This involves handling the transition from one day to the next within the same month and year. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for dates and times, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(HH, MM)`.\n   - Ensure these structures can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding hours and days.\n\n2. **Add 24 Hours Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_24_hours(Date, Time, NewDate, NewTime)` that adds 24 hours to the given date and time.\n   - This function should handle the transition from one day to the next within the same month and year.\n\n3. **Handling Midnight Transition:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_24_hours` function to check if the resulting time is after midnight (e.g., `HH` becomes greater than 23). If so, decrement `HH` to 0 and increment the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between months and years if the day addition exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the end of February during leap years.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_24_hours` function with various input dates and times, including cases where the addition crosses midnight, transitions between months, and occurs during leap years.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and time and receive the date and time 24 hours later.\n\n8. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Consider using recursive rules to handle the addition of 24 hours, especially when crossing midnight or transitioning between months or years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately determine the date and time 24 hours later from a given input, handling various transitions and ensuring correct date and time calculations.",

Given that she is celebrating the last day of the month, the date today is January 31, 2012, represented as 01/31/2012 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the date of the last day of a given month and year.

In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to determine the last day of a specified month and year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle month and year inputs.\n\n2. **Last Day of the Month Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to determine the last day of a given month and year. This rule should consider the varying number of days in different months (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 or 29 days in February, 30 days in April, etc.).\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly determining the last day of February in leap years (29 days) versus non-leap years (28 days).\n\n4. **Month and Day Boundaries:**\n   - Include logic to handle month and day boundaries correctly. For example, if the input month is December, the last day should be set to 31, and the month should not roll over to January.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the last day of a month, considering leap years and month boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rule based on the input month and year, ensuring the correct last day is determined.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different months and years, including leap years and non-leap years, to ensure the last day is calculated accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the last day of a specified month and year, taking into account varying month lengths and leap years.

In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including day subtraction, to handle this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day subtraction operations.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day (`DD`) from the given date. If `DD` becomes 0, then decrement `MM` and set `DD` to the last day of the new month.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition between months when subtracting days. For example, if the date is January 1, subtracting one day should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case for subtracting days near the end of December, ensuring the year is decremented correctly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to correctly handle February 29 during day subtraction in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle day subtraction, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day subtraction based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for day subtraction within the same month, across month boundaries, and near the end of the year. For example, test cases could include subtracting a day from January 31, February 28, and December 31.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date yesterday based on the input date, handling month and year transitions correctly and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply those rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, which is January 31, and wants to know the date one week ago from that day. To calculate the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from January 31, 2012. This results in a date of January 24, 2012, which can be represented as 01/24/2012 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date subtraction, specifically subtracting seven days from a given date. This involves understanding how to handle the transition between days, months, and years when subtracting days. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to handle these transitions correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If `DD` is not 1, decrement it by 1. If `DD` is 1, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition between months when subtracting days. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day, adjust the day to the last day of the new month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January when subtracting days, decrementing the year and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Create a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during date subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days) from a given date. This will involve repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition rules are applied based on the current date during the subtraction process.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases to verify the correct date subtraction across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years, and considering the impact of leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, which is January 31, and wants to know the date one week from today. To calculate this, we need to add seven days to the current date. Since there are only 28-31 days in each month, adding seven days will not cause us to enter the following month. Therefore, the date one week from today is February 7, 2012, or 02/07/2012 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic by adding seven days to the given date. This involves understanding the structure of the date, including the month, day, and year, and then incrementing the day component by seven. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to handle date manipulation and addition of days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle cases where the addition causes a transition to a new month or year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to check if the resulting day is greater than the maximum days in the current month. If so, set the day to 1 and increment the month.\n   - For December, if the month rolls over to 13, reset it to 1 and increment the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. For example, to add seven days, call the `add_days` function recursively with 6 as the number of days to add, then with 5, and so on.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, adding days that cross into a new month, and adding days that cross into a new year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and the number of days they want to add, then display the resulting date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from a given date, handling month and year transitions correctly and considering leap years.

Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be February 1, 2012, which can be represented as 02/01/2012 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the date by one day, but it specifically deals with the transition from January to February.

For regular day transitions, this rule will be applied.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the current day is the last day of the month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date given that it was September 1, 2021, a week ago. This implies that a week has passed since September 1, so today's date is exactly seven days after that, which is September 8, 2021. This date can be represented as 09/08/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate today's date based on a given past date and a specific interval (one week). This involves understanding date arithmetic, including handling month and year transitions if necessary. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to increment the given date by seven days, taking into account any month or year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations like adding days.\n\n2. **Date Increment Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function will handle day increments, month transitions, and year transitions as needed.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check if adding the specified number of days would exceed the current month's end. If so, adjust the month and day accordingly, and consider year transitions for December.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years when adding days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct date transition rules based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Given the date a week ago (September 1, 2021), use the `add_days` function with an increment of 7 days to calculate today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine today's date based on the input of a past date and the interval of one week. The program will handle date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and leap years, providing a flexible solution for date calculations in SWI-Prolog.",

To find the date one month ago, we need to go back by 30 days (assuming a 30-day month for simplicity). Counting back 30 days from September 1, we arrive at August 2, 2021, which is the date one month ago.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one month before a given date. This involves understanding how to handle month and year transitions when subtracting a month. In this case, we are moving from September to August, which is a straightforward one-month difference. Prolog can assist in managing these transitions through rule-based logic.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting a month.\n\n2. **Subtract a Month Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one month from a given date. If `MM` is not January, decrement it by 1. If `MM` is January, decrement `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to December.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day, adjust the day to the last day of the new month.\n\n4. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering the possibility of crossing year boundaries.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February when subtracting months, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the month subtraction process.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that a week ago it was September 1, 2021. To solve this, we need to first calculate today's date and then add seven days to it. Since there are seven days in a week, today's date is September 8, 2021. Adding seven days to this date will give us the date for one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: finding today's date and then adding seven days to that date. The first step requires understanding the relationship between dates, especially when moving from one month to the next. The second step involves basic date arithmetic, adding days to a given date while handling month and year transitions correctly. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to perform these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding days.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate today's date based on the given information. In this case, since it was September 1 a week ago, today's date is September 8, 2021.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. Use recursion to repeatedly add a single day until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if adding a day causes `DD` to exceed the number of days in the current month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during date additions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied when adding days, especially when transitioning between months and years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `add_days` function for various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from a given date, handling date arithmetic and transitions between months and years accurately.",

We will need to consider the following:\n1. **Date Representation:** Define a structure to represent dates, allowing for year increments and day adjustments.\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:** Implement a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February during year increments.\n3. **Year Increment:** Write a rule to increment the year component of the date by one, considering leap years and adjusting the day and month if necessary.\n4. **Day and Month Adjustments:** Handle adjustments to the day and month components when adding years, especially in the case of leap years.\n5. **Recursive Logic:** Use recursion to add multiple years, ensuring that leap year adjustments are made correctly.\n6. **Test Cases:** Include test cases to validate the correctness of the date calculations, especially around leap years and month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle year increments and day/month adjustments.\n\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Write a predicate `leap_year(YYYY)` that checks if a given year is a leap year. This will be used to adjust the number of days in February during year increments.\n\n3. **Increment Year Rule:**\n   - Create a rule `increment_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that increments the year by one. If the new year is a leap year and the current date is in February, adjust the day and month accordingly (e.g., February 29, 2020, would become February 28, 2021).\n\n4. **Adjust Day and Month:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day and month components when adding years. For example, if the date is January 31, adding one year should result in February 28 (or 29 in a leap year).\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to add five years to the date. Call the `increment_year` rule repeatedly until five years have been added.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as adding five years to February 28 in both leap and non-leap years, adding five years to December 31, and adding five years to a date in March.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date of Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, taking into account leap years and date adjustments. This will involve recursive logic, date manipulation, and careful handling of leap year exceptions.",

Therefore, the date tomorrow will be January 3, 1963, represented as 01/03/1963 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is one day after a given date, considering the number of years that have passed since Jane and John's wedding. This involves understanding date arithmetic, including adding days and years to a given date. In Prolog, we can use rules and functions to perform these calculations and handle date transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding days and years.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.

If the resulting year is a leap year, adjust the end date of February to the 29th.\n\n5. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date. This function should call `add_days` to add 365 days for each year, considering leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days or years.

        "question": "Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, which is January 2, 1958. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from this anniversary date. Subtracting 10 days from January 2 results in a date of December 23, 1957. Therefore, the date 10 days ago was 12/23/1957 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of 10 days from a given date, considering potential transitions between months and years. In this case, the date falls within the same month and year, so there are no month or year transitions to account for. However, we still need to ensure that the day subtraction is handled correctly, taking into account the number of days in the month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day subtraction operations.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a single day from a given date. If `DD` is greater than 1, decrement `DD` by 1. Otherwise, if `DD` is 1, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle month and year transitions when subtracting days. If the day subtraction causes `MM` to become 0, decrement `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to 12 (December). Then, adjust `DD` to the appropriate day within December.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Day Subtraction:**\n   - Create a recursive rule to subtract multiple days. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date structure during the day subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that validate the day subtraction rule for various scenarios, including normal day subtraction, month transitions, and year transitions. For example, subtracting 10 days from January 2, 1958, should result in December 23, 1957.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date a certain number of days ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years, and taking into account leap years.",

The task is to determine the date one week from today, which involves adding seven days to the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one week (7 days) from the given date, considering the transition between years. Since the date is already in January, there is no need to worry about month transitions. However, we do need to account for the year increment when adding seven days. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this calculation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days and years.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.

This will be important for accurately calculating the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n4. **Consider Days in Each Month:**\n   - Include a list or predicate that provides the number of days in each month, considering leap years. This will be used to accurately calculate the days difference when crossing month boundaries.\n\n5. **Add Days to a Date:**\n   - Write a predicate `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a given number of days to a date, considering month and year transitions. This will be useful for finding the current date after adding the calculated days difference.\n\n6. **Use of SWI-Prolog Predicates:**\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's built-in predicates, such as `dif/3`, to perform date arithmetic and calculate the difference between two dates.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `days_difference` predicate with various date combinations, including crossing month and year boundaries, to ensure accurate results.\n   - Test the `add_days` predicate to ensure it correctly handles adding days to dates, including month and year transitions.\n\n8. **Calculate Current Date:**\n   - Use the `days_difference` predicate to calculate the number of days between May 9, 2017, and today's date, given that Jane ate one egg per day.\n   - Then, use the `add_days` predicate to add that number of days to May 9, 2017, to find today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can determine the current date based on the given information about Jane's egg consumption. This will involve date arithmetic, handling leap years, and using SWI-Prolog's built-in predicates for efficient date calculations.",

        "question": "On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nGiven that Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one egg per day, the problem is to determine the date when she runs out of eggs, which is today, and then calculate the date for tomorrow. This involves counting 40 days forward from May 9, 2017, which lands on June 17, 2017. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be June 18, 2017, represented as 06/18/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate a date that is a certain number of days (40) after a given start date. This requires handling month and year transitions, as counting 40 days forward will likely cross over into a new month and possibly a new year. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these transitions and calculate the target date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to a date.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(StartDate, Days, EndDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a start date and returns the end date.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when adding days. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the current month, increment the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the next year when adding days causes the month to exceed December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a function to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years when adding days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. The function `add_days` can call itself recursively to add one day at a time until the total number of days is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules for month and year transitions based on the current date during the addition process.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various start dates and numbers of days to ensure correct handling of month and year transitions, including leap years.\n\n9. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Using the `add_days` function, calculate the date when Jane runs out of eggs (40 days after May 9, 2017).\n   - Then, add one more day to find the date for tomorrow.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date when Jane runs out of eggs and then calculate the date for tomorrow, handling date arithmetic and transitions effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from the day Jane ran out of eggs. Given that she bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one per day, she would have run out of eggs 40 days after May 9, which is June 18, 2017. Therefore, the date 10 days ago from June 18, 2017, is June 8, 2017, represented as 06/08/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date a certain number of days before a given date. Specifically, we need to handle the subtraction of 10 days from June 18, 2017. This calculation requires understanding month and year transitions when subtracting days. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month and year transitions. If the day of the month is 1, subtracting a day should result in the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the month is January, subtracting a day should decrement the year and set the month to December.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, 10 days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to dynamically apply the correct rules for day subtraction based on the current date structure. This will ensure accurate transitions between months and years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions, leap years, and different numbers of days to subtract.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given the starting date of May 9, 2017, calculate the date when Jane ran out of eggs by adding 40 days.\n   - Then, use the day subtraction rule to find the date 10 days prior to that date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 10 days ago from the day Jane ran out of eggs, considering month and year transitions and handling leap years.

In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage these date manipulations effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day subtraction and year subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering the transition between months. If the day of the month is 1, subtracting a day should result in the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle month and year transitions when subtracting days. If subtracting a day results in a date before the start of the current month, decrement the month. If the month becomes negative, decrement the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during the subtraction process.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Subtracting Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to dynamically apply the correct rules for day, month, and year subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including subtracting days across month boundaries, year boundaries, and leap years. Ensure that the program correctly handles all possible date transitions.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for One Year Ago:**\n   - Use the recursive subtraction rule to calculate the date one year ago by subtracting 365 days from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year ago from today, considering all necessary date transitions, month lengths, and leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, ate one per day, and ran out of eggs today. This problem involves calculating the number of days between two dates and then subtracting seven days to find the date one week ago. Today's date, when Jane ran out of eggs, is 40 days after May 9, 2017, which is June 18, 2017. Therefore, the date one week ago would be June 11, 2017, represented as 06/11/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including adding days to a given date and then subtracting seven days to find the date one week ago. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including adding and subtracting days, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions, such as rolling over to the next month or year if needed.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `subtract_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date. This function should also handle month and year transitions, similar to the `add_days` function.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions to check for month-end and year-end transitions. For example, if adding days results in a date like June 31, it should be adjusted to July 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Calculate Days Between Dates:**\n   - Write a function `days_between(Date1, Date2, Days)` that calculates the number of days between two given dates.

        "question": "On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the day Jane ran out of eggs. Given that Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one egg per day, she would have run out of eggs 40 days later, which is June 18, 2017. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be June 19, 2017, represented as 06/19/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a specific event that occurred in the past. We need to determine the date when Jane ran out of eggs by counting 40 days from the purchase date, and then adding another 24 hours to find the date 24 hours after that. In Prolog, we can use date arithmetic and rules to handle this calculation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Egg Consumption Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date when Jane ran out of eggs. This involves adding 40 days to the purchase date (May 9, 2017).\n\n3. **Adding 24 Hours:**\n   - Write a rule to add 24 hours (1 day) to a given date. This will handle the transition from the day Jane ran out of eggs to the date 24 hours later.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. For example, adding 24 hours to June 30 should result in July 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days (40 days) and then an additional 24 hours.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the correct rules for date addition based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, adding days that cross month boundaries, and adding days that span across years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours after Jane ran out of eggs, considering date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and leap years. This will involve defining rules for date addition and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

The first quarter of a year includes the months of January, February, and March, and it ends on the last day of March. Therefore, today's date is March 31, 2008, which can be represented as 03/31/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of quarters in a year and identify the last day of the first quarter. The year is divided into four quarters, each consisting of three consecutive months. The first quarter spans from January 1 to March 31. In Prolog, we can define rules to calculate the last day of a given quarter and represent dates accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle month and year arithmetic.\n\n2. **Calculate Last Day of a Quarter:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the last day of a given quarter for a specified year. This rule should identify the correct month and day for the last day of the quarter.\n   - For example, to find the last day of the first quarter (Q1) of 2008: Q1 spans from January 1 to March 31, so the result should be 03/31/2008.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle year transitions correctly.

The first quarter of a year includes the months of January, February, and March. Since today is the last day of this quarter, it must be March 31, 2008. Therefore, the date yesterday would be March 30, 2008, represented as 03/30/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the last day of the first quarter of a given year and then calculate the date one day prior.

The last day of the first quarter is the last day of March, which in the year 2008, was March 31. Therefore, the date 10 days prior to this would be March 21, 2008, represented as 03/21/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date, March 31, 2008, while handling the transition between months correctly. In this case, the subtraction does not involve a transition to a different month, but it is important to consider this possibility when creating a general solution. Prolog can be used to define rules for date subtraction and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from March 31 should result in March 30 of the same year.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when the day is the first of the month. This involves decrementing the month and setting the day to the last day of that month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from June 1 should result in May 31.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the previous year when subtracting days from the first days of January. This requires decrementing the year and setting the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule. This will handle cases where the subtraction spans across multiple months or years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for day and month transitions based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve transitions between months and years, such as subtracting days from the end of December or during leap years.\n   - Verify the correctness of the program by subtracting various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and dates that span across multiple months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate a date a certain number of days prior to a given date, considering month and year transitions and handling special cases like leap years.

The last day of the first quarter is March 31, so today's date is March 31, 2008. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting one year from a given date, which includes handling the transition between different months and years. In this case, subtracting one year from March 31, 2008, would result in a date in March 2007. However, since March 2007 only has 31 days, we need to consider the transition to the last day of that month, which is March 31, 2007. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) by 1 and handling the transition to the previous month and day if necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting month and day are valid for the new year. If the day is greater than the number of days in that month, adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today's date, which is the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter of a year includes the months of January, February, and March. Since March typically has 31 days, and there are no leap year considerations for the year 2008, the last day of the first quarter in 2008 would be March 31, 2008. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be April 1, 2008, represented as 04/01/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a simple day increment from the given date, considering the transition from March to April. In Prolog, we can define rules for handling day increments and month transitions to solve this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 31, the next date should be April 1, 2008.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. In this case, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 32, the next date should be April 1, 2008.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December. This is not applicable in this specific case, but it's a general consideration for date calculations.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not relevant for the year 2008, include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n   - Specifically, test cases for the transition from March 31 to April 1 and the transition from December 31 to January 1 should be included.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling month transitions and considering leap years when necessary.",

The solution requires understanding the pattern of weekdays in a year and counting the number of days from the start of the year to the target weekday. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for calculating weekdays and counting days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Weekday Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Use atoms like `monday, tuesday`, etc., to represent weekdays.\n\n2. **Calculating Weekdays:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the weekday of a given date.

If the resulting day is less than 1, adjust it to the last day of the previous month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February during day subtraction, as February has 28 days in non-leap years and 29 days in leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day and month subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions, leap years, and non-leap years.

If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the new month, roll back to the last day of that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the first Monday and the subtraction of a month. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in applying the correct rules based on the current date structure.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various years to ensure the first Monday is calculated correctly and the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including end-of-year transitions and leap years.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a year and receive the date one month prior to the first Monday of that year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before the first Monday of a given year, considering day and month transitions and handling leap years correctly.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from the first Monday of 2019. Given that the first day of 2019 (January 1) was a Tuesday, the first Monday of the year would be three days later, on January 7, 2019. To find the date one week ago from this date, we need to subtract seven days, which would result in a date in late December of 2018.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (seven days) before the given date, which is the first Monday of 2019. This involves understanding how to calculate the first Monday of a year and then performing a simple subtraction of seven days, taking into account any transitions between months and years. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day and month adjustments.\n\n2. **Calculate First Monday:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of the first Monday of a given year. This involves finding the first day of January, identifying if it is a Monday, and if not, adding days until the first Monday is reached.\n\n3. **Subtract Days:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract seven days from a given date. This rule should handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days. For example, subtracting seven days from January 7 may result in a date in December of the previous year.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Ensure that the day, month, and year components are adjusted correctly when subtracting days. If the resulting month is December and further subtraction is needed, decrement the year and set the month to November.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days or calculating the first Monday.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the first Monday and the subtraction of seven days. This will allow for dynamic adjustments based on the input year.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day and month adjustments during the subtraction process, ensuring accurate transitions between months and years.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various years to ensure the correct calculation of the first Monday and the subsequent subtraction of seven days, including transitions across month and year boundaries, and considering leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can determine the date one week prior to the first Monday of a given year, handling all necessary date calculations, transitions, and adjustments effectively.",
