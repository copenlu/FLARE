Given that today is March 12, 2002, the date 24 hours later would be March 13, 2002. This can be represented as 03/13/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day. This involves understanding the month-day boundaries and handling the transition from one day to the next. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage day increments and check for month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 12, then the next date should be March 13, 2002.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. For instance, if the date is March 31, the next date should be April 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle the end of February, especially in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., March 12 to March 13), month-end transitions (e.g., March 31 to April 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion."

This can be represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this specific case since April has 30 days. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions."

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future, which means it will be January 1, 2015, in 12 hours. Therefore, today is December 30, 2014. One week from today would be January 6, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the new year transition from December to January. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to December 30, 2014, should result in January 6, 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that today is December 31, 2020. Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date. Since December 31 is the last day of the year, subtracting seven days means we need to go back into the previous month, December, and find the date that corresponds to seven days before December 31.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting days. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering the transition between months. For example, if `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve recursive logic and careful consideration of month and year boundaries."

Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to the US Thanksgiving in 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001. Therefore, one month before this date would be October 22, 2001, which can be represented as 10/22/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one month prior to a given date. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating dates based on the US Thanksgiving holiday and then performing a simple month subtraction, taking care to adjust the year if necessary (e.g., if the month is January). In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November. Use date manipulation functions to find the first day of November of the given year, then calculate the first Thursday, and finally add three weeks to get the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day (e.g., moving from March 31 to February), adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Thanksgiving and the month subtraction. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in matching the correct rules based on the input year and handling exceptions like leap years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months or calculating dates.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years to ensure the Thanksgiving date is calculated correctly and the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including end-of-year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before Thanksgiving for any given year, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively."

Since December has only 31 days, today cannot be December 32, 1929. Therefore, the correct date today is January 1, 1930, represented as 01/01/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one year to the next, which occurs after December 31. The key is to recognize that the date rolls over to January 1 of the following year. This requires understanding both month-day boundaries and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to correctly identify when the transition to a new month and year should occur.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage both day and month increments as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should change the month to January (`MM` becomes 1), the day to 1, and increment the year (`YYYY` increases by 1).\n\n3. **Normal Case:**\n   - Write a rule that simply increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month and handles month transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between different months, recognizing that different months have different numbers of days (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days, etc.).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to determine if the year is a leap year to correctly handle February dates.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle day, month, and year transitions, making sure that the correct logic is applied depending on the date structure.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s built-in search to correctly apply rules and pattern matching, ensuring the correct date is selected when moving from one day to the next.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct transition from December 31 to January 1 across different years, including both non-leap and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately determines the date \"today\" based on the input, handling both regular and boundary cases like year transitions."

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. To find today's date, we simply need to add one day to yesterday's date, keeping in mind the transition between months. Since April has 30 days, adding one day takes us to the next month, May. Therefore, today's date is May 1, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple day increment from a known date, taking into account month boundaries. In Prolog, we can define rules for incrementing days and handling transitions between months. The key is to recognize when the day is the last in a month and adjust the month and day values accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. If `DD` is the last day of the month, then set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months. If the incremented day is greater than the number of days in the current month, roll over to the next month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February during leap years. If the year is a leap year and the month is February, ensure that the number of days is set to 29.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month boundaries and leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date. This will ensure that the day increment is handled correctly, especially during month transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months, such as April 30 to May 1, and cases involving leap years, such as February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine today's date based on the input of yesterday's date, handling month transitions and considering leap years.

The challenge is to handle the transition between months correctly, as the calculation will span over a month boundary. In Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month transitions, ensuring that the correct date is determined.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day and month decrements.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from yesterday's date, which was April 30, 2021. To find the date a month ago, we need to go back one month from April 29, 2021, since April 30 of the previous month does not exist. This calculation will lead us to March 29, 2021, as the date one month ago.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another, considering that not all months have the same number of days. In this case, we are moving from April to March, which involves a 30-day difference. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this transition correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting a month.\n\n2. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, then the previous month should be December of the previous year.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from April should result in March of the same year.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day component of the date when subtracting a month. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n   - For instance, if the date is April 30, moving one month back should result in March 31.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date one month ago. This will involve applying the month subtraction rule and then adjusting the day if needed.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct month transition based on the current month and year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from January, February during leap and non-leap years, and other months with different day counts.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given that yesterday was April 30, 2021, use the month subtraction rule to calculate the date one month ago.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month ago from a given date, handling month transitions and day adjustments correctly.

For instance, adding days to a date in December may lead to the next year.\n   - Ensure that the day remains valid after the transition, adjusting it if necessary (e.g., adding days to January 31 may result in February 3 or February 2 during leap years).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add multiple days to a date. This will be useful for adding seven days in one step.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for adding days, handling month and year transitions, and adjusting days as needed.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including transitions between months and years, to ensure that the date additions are accurate.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles leap years and different lengths of months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week from today, considering all necessary date calculations and transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from April 30, 2021, which is a straightforward calculation that involves adding one day to the given date. Since there are no month or year transitions involved, the date 24 hours later would simply be May 1, 2021, represented as 05/01/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the day component of the given date by one, considering that April has 30 days, so there is no need to worry about month transitions. The focus is solely on ensuring that the day is incremented correctly. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for basic date arithmetic, specifically incrementing the day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations, especially for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1, considering that months have varying numbers of days. This rule should be applicable to all dates except those that fall on the last day of a month with fewer than 30 days.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific example, include a general rule to handle transitions to the next month when the day exceeds the maximum for the current month. For instance, if the date is January 31, the next date should be February 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rule is applied based on the input date.

This means that today is either May 30 or May 31, 2021, depending on whether \"two days away\" is inclusive or exclusive of today. To find today's date, we need to subtract two days from the deadline date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days before a given date. Specifically, we need to handle the transition from one month to another (from June to May) and potentially adjust for an inclusive or exclusive count of days. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations and handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic, including day and month decrements.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month and year transitions. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should identify the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the deadline, which is June 1, 2021, and given that the deadline is two days away from now. This calculation involves incrementing the deadline date by one day. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be June 2, 2021, represented as 06/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing a given date by one day, taking into account potential month and year transitions. In this case, since the deadline is in June, there is no need to worry about month or year transitions. The solution requires a simple day increment, ensuring that the day does not exceed the maximum for the given month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 6 (June) and `DD` is 1, the next date should be June 2, 2021.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month. For example, if the date is May 31, the next date should be June 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is already December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions to ensure the rules are applied correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later from a given deadline, handling both simple and complex date transitions, including month and year boundaries.",

This involves subtracting one year from the given date while handling potential month and day adjustments due to the length of the previous year.

Combining these, the date represented is August 3, 1997, which can be formatted as 08/03/1997 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves taking separate components of a date (month, day, and year) and combining them into a single date representation. The challenge is to ensure that the month, day, and year are correctly formatted and valid. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to validate and format the date accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle input validation and formatting.\n\n2. **Input Validation:**\n   - Write rules to validate the input components (month, day, and year).

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today's date, which is August 3, 1997. A week from today would be August 10, 1997. This can be represented as 08/10/1997 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date that is a certain number of days (in this case, 7 days) from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years if the calculation crosses those boundaries. In this specific case, the calculation does not cross any month or year boundaries, so the solution is straightforward.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function will handle normal day increments and month/year transitions if necessary.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule within `add_days` to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This rule should adjust the month and reset the day accordingly.\n\n5. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December. This rule should increment the year and reset the month and day accordingly.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years. If the year is a leap year and the date falls in February, ensure that the number of days in February is 29.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. The `add_days` function should call itself recursively to add each day until the specified number of days is reached.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test adding 7 days to August 3, 1997, to validate that the result is August 10, 1997.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date one week from a given date, handling potential month and year transitions and considering leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to represent today's date, September 9, 1909, in the MM/DD/YYYY format. This date can be formatted as 09/09/1909, where 09/09 represents the month and day, and 1909 is the four-digit year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a SWI-Prolog code prompt that allows the user to input the month, day, and year, and then format the date in the desired MM/DD/YYYY format. The code should handle input validation to ensure that the month and day are represented by two digits each, and the year is a four-digit number.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Input Validation:**\n   - Start by defining a rule to validate user input. Ensure that the month, day, and year are all positive integers.\n   - Use Prolog's `between/3` predicate to check if the month and day are within the valid ranges (1-12 for the month and 1-31 for the day).\n   - Validate that the year is a four-digit integer.\n\n2. **Date Representation:**\n   - Define a structure, `date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent the input date. This structure will be used to hold the month, day, and year components of the date.\n\n3. **Format Output:**\n   - Create a rule to format the `date` structure into the desired MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Use Prolog's string concatenation (`/`) operator to concatenate the month, day, and year with slashes in between.\n\n4. **User Interaction:**\n   - Write a rule to prompt the user for the month, day, and year, and then validate and store the input in the `date` structure.\n\n5. **Display Result:**\n   - Implement a rule to display the formatted date to the user.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the input validation rules, ensuring that invalid inputs are handled gracefully.\n   - Test the date formatting rule with various valid dates to ensure the correct output format.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific problem, consider using recursive rules to handle more complex date calculations or transformations in the future.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user through inputting a date and receiving the formatted date in the desired MM/DD/YYYY format.

This involves incrementing the day by one while considering month and year boundaries. Since September has 30 days, the date tomorrow will be September 10, 1909, which can be represented as 09/10/1909 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross any month or year boundaries. In Prolog, we can handle this with rules that increment the day and check for month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments within the same month and year.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This rule should adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is December and the day increment causes it to overflow. This rule should increment `YYYY` and reset `MM` and `DD` to January 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years. If the year is a leap year, adjust the end date of February to the 29th.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, test the transition from September 30 to October 1 and from December 31 to January 1.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date for tomorrow based on the given input, handling month and year boundaries correctly.",

In this case, since September has 30 days, subtracting one day from September 9 will result in September 8, 1909.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of a single day from a given date.

        "question": "Today is Sep 9, 1909. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, September 9, 1909. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current year, 1909, resulting in the year 1908. Then, we need to consider the month and day adjustments to account for the length of the year. Since September is the ninth month, and there are 365 days in a standard year, we need to go back approximately 365 days from today. This calculation will lead us to the date range of early to mid-September in the year 1908.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date, considering the transition between months and the variation in the number of days in each month. In this case, we are moving from September 1909 to September 1908, which is a straightforward transition within the same month. However, we need to account for the difference in days between common years (365 days) and leap years (366 days). Prolog can assist in managing these calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like year subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) by 1 and considering any necessary adjustments to the month and day.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition between months when subtracting a year. If the resulting month and day are invalid (e.g., September 31), adjust the day and month accordingly to the last valid day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if the original year is a leap year (1908 in this case). If it is a leap year, and the date falls within the leap day (February 29), adjust the day and month to March 1 in the previous year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the previous one, considering month and day adjustments.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for year subtraction, month and day adjustments, and leap year considerations based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as subtracting a year from various dates, including month-end dates and leap year dates. Verify that the program correctly handles transitions between months and years, accounting for leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one year prior to a given date, considering month and day adjustments and handling leap years. This will involve defining rules for year subtraction, month and day adjustments, and leap year checks, leveraging SWI-Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

For example, if `MM` is 9 (September) and `DD` is 9, the next date should be September 10, 1909.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule to handle transitions to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle transitions to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is not necessary for this specific date but will be useful for handling February in other cases.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Define recursive rules to handle transitions from one day to the next, taking into account month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling both regular and boundary cases, although in this specific instance, only a simple day increment is required.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from today's date, which is April 19, 1969. To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from the current month and adjust the day and year accordingly.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and consider the number of days in each month. Since there are 30 days in April, subtracting one month will take us to March. We also need to consider the day component and adjust it based on the number of days in the target month. In this case, March has 31 days, so we need to determine if the resulting day will be valid. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting months.\n\n2. **Handling Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is not January, decrement the month by 1. If the month is January, decrement the year by 1 and set the month to December.\n\n3. **Adjusting Day Component:**\n   - After subtracting a month, check if the resulting day is valid for the new month. If the day is greater than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling February. If the year is a leap year and the new month is February, set the maximum day to 29.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering the adjustment of the day component. This will ensure that the resulting date is valid.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for month subtraction and day adjustment.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from different starting dates, including month-end and year-end transitions, and handling leap years.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date one month prior. Ensure that the program handles invalid inputs and provides clear error messages.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month ago from a given date, considering month transitions and day adjustments.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is April 19, 1969. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to the current date. This calculation will result in a date of April 26, 1969, which can be represented as 04/26/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a fixed number of days (seven days) to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months correctly, as adding seven days might lead to the next month. In this specific case, adding seven days to April 19 will not cross into the next month, but this logic should be generalizable to other dates. In Prolog, we can define rules for date addition and month transitions to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between months correctly, considering the number of days in each month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if adding the specified number of days crosses the boundary of the current month. If so, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n   - For example, if the current date is April 30 and we add 3 days, the new date should be May 3.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. The `add_days` function should call itself recursively until the desired number of days has been added.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various dates and numbers of days to add, including cases that cross month boundaries and leap years.\n   - Verify that the function correctly handles transitions between months and years, such as adding days to January 31 or February 28/29.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date one week from a given date, handling month transitions and considering leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that Jane was born on the last day of February in the year 2000, and today is her 16th birthday. Since Jane is turning 16, it means that exactly 16 years have passed since her birth year, 2000, which makes the current year 2016. Additionally, knowing that she was born on the last day of February provides further context for pinpointing the exact date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that falls exactly 16 years after February 29, 2000, considering that Jane was born on the last day of February, which is the 28th or 29th depending on the leap year. This involves understanding how to handle leap years and performing date arithmetic across multiple years. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including year increments and leap year checks, to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations involving year increments and day/month adjustments.\n\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This is crucial for determining the number of days in February and correctly calculating dates across leap years.\n\n3. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date. This function should handle the transition from February 28/29 to March 1 in non-leap/leap years, respectively.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the `add_years` function, include logic to adjust the month and day values correctly when crossing month boundaries. For example, adding one year to January 31 should result in February 28 (or 29 in a leap year).\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple years, decrementing the `Years` counter until it reaches zero.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for date adjustments based on the current date and the number of years being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including adding years across month and year boundaries, handling leap years, and non-leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, and she is turning 16 this year. This means she was born in the year 2000, and her birthday this year is February 29, 2016, as 2016 is a leap year. To find the date tomorrow, we need to calculate the date one day after February 29, 2016.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from a leap year day to a non-leap year day. Since 2016 is a leap year, February has 29 days. Tomorrow's date will be in March, and we need to determine the correct date in March, considering the number of days in February for non-leap years. In Prolog, we can define rules for handling leap years, date increments, and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly identifying leap years like 2016, where February has 29 days.\n\n3. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering the transition between months. If the day is the last day of the month, the rule should roll over to the next month.\n\n4. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition between months when incrementing days. This rule should adjust the month and day values accordingly, considering the number of days in each month.\n\n5. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition between years when necessary, such as when incrementing from December 31 to January 1.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to increment days by repeatedly applying the single-day increment rule until the desired number of days has passed.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as incrementing days within the same month, transitioning between months, handling leap years, and non-leap years.\n\n9. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Given Jane's birthday as February 29, 2016, use the defined rules to calculate the date tomorrow, considering the leap year and month transition.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date tomorrow, given Jane's birthday information, by handling leap years, date increments, and month transitions effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane's 16th birthday, given that she was born on the last day of February in the year 2000. Since Jane is turning 16, today's date is her birthday in the year 2016. Calculating the date 10 days ago involves subtracting 10 days from this birthday date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days from a date, taking into account the transition between months and years. February, being the shortest month, adds complexity to this calculation. In a non-leap year, February has 28 days, so subtracting 10 days from the end of February would result in a date in the middle of February. However, we need to consider the possibility of leap years, where February has 29 days. In this case, the calculation becomes more intricate.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Calculate Jane's Birthday:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's birthday for a given year. Since she was born on the last day of February, this rule should find the last day of February in the specified year.\n\n3. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Implement a function to subtract a certain number of days from a given date. This function should handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to manage the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next when subtracting days. For example, subtracting 10 days from February 28, 2016, would result in February 18, 2016.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Develop a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during leap years. If the year is a leap year, February will have 29 days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days, ensuring that the correct transitions are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for day subtraction and month/year transitions based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including transitions between months and years, and consider both leap and non-leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, and she turned 16 this year (2016). To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate today's date and then add seven days. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday in 2016 would have been February 29, as 2016 is a leap year. Therefore, today is March 1, 2016, and one week from today would be March 8, 2016, represented as 03/08/2016 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known birthday and age. The key steps are to determine Jane's birthday for this year, calculate today's date, and then add seven days to find the date one week later. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these calculations, taking into account leap years and month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days and years.\n\n2. **Calculate Birthday Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's birthday for a given year. This involves determining the last day of February, considering leap years.\n\n3. **Age Calculation:**\n   - Implement a function to calculate Jane's age in years given her birth year and the current year.\n\n4. **Today's Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate today's date based on Jane's birthday and age. For example, if Jane is 16 today, then 16 years should be added to her birth year to get this year.\n\n5. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to add a certain number of days to a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n6. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. For example, adding days to March 31 should result in April 1.\n\n7. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly calculating the last day of February.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different birth years and ages to ensure the birthday and today's date are calculated correctly, especially in leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one week from today based on a person's birthday and age, taking into account leap years and date transitions.",

For example, adding one year to January 31 should result in February 28 in a common year or February 29 in a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the next, considering leap years. This will ensure that the correct number of days is added for each year.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for year, month, and day adjustments based on the input date and the number of years added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various dates and numbers of years added, especially those that cross leap years or end-of-month boundaries.\n\n8. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Given Jane's birthdate as February 28, 2001, use the `increment_years` function to add 16 years, considering leap years, to arrive at today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate today's date based on Jane's birthdate and her 16th birthday, taking into account leap years and date adjustments.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, which is February 28 in common years and February 29 during leap years. Given that she is turning 16 this year, it must be a leap year, and her birthday this year was February 29, 2017. Therefore, today is February 29, 2017, and the date tomorrow will be March 1, 2017, represented as 03/01/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of Jane's 16th birthday, considering that she was born on a leap day (February 29) and that her 16th birthday must also fall on a leap day. This involves determining the correct year for her 16th birthday and then calculating the date for the day after her birthday. In Prolog, we can use rules and arithmetic operations to handle date calculations and leap year checks.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and days.\n\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Write a predicate `leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This can be done by checking if the year is divisible by 4, and if it is not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.\n\n3. **Age Calculation:**\n   - Write a function `calculate_age(birth_date(MM, DD, YYYY), Age)` to compute the age in years between the birth date and the current date. This will involve subtracting years and handling leap years correctly.\n\n4. **Birthday Calculation:**\n   - Create a predicate `birthday(birth_date(MM, DD, YYYY), CurrentDate)` to determine if `CurrentDate` is Jane's birthday. This involves checking if the `DD` and `MM` values match her birth date, and if the `YYYY` value is a leap year.\n\n5. **Date Incrementation:**\n   - Implement a function `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to calculate the date that is one day after a given date.

Since Jane is turning 16, it means 16 years have passed since her birth year, 2001, which makes the current year 2017. Her 16th birthday would have been on February 28, 2017, as 2017 is not a leap year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday falling on the last day of February in 2023 indicates that she was born on a leap day, February 29, 2001. The task is to determine the date one year ago from her 16th birthday. Since 2022 was not a leap year, her birthday in 2022 would have been on February 28. Therefore, the date one year ago from her 16th birthday would be February 28, 2022, which can be represented as 02/28/2022 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date one year prior to a given date, considering the complexity of leap years and the fact that Jane was born on a leap day. In Prolog, this can be solved by defining rules for date arithmetic, handling leap years, and managing the transition from February 29 to February 28 in non-leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including year subtraction.\n\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Write a predicate `leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for handling the transition from February 29 to February 28 in non-leap years.\n\n3. **Date Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the year is a leap year, the rule should handle the transition from February 29 to February 28.\n\n4. **Handling Non-Leap Years:**\n   - Include logic to handle the case when the year is not a leap year. If the date is February 29, it should be adjusted to February 28 of the same year.\n\n5. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Ensure that the month and day are adjusted correctly during year subtraction. For example, subtracting one year from January 1 should result in January 1 of the previous year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the previous one, considering leap years and month/day adjustments.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date subtraction based on whether the year is a leap year or not.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve leap years and non-leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from Jane's 16th birthday, given that she was born on the last day of February in 2001. Since Jane is turning 16, her birthday this year is on February 28, 2017. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past based on a known date (birthday) and a specified interval (one week). The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days, especially considering that February has 28 days in common years and 29 days in leap years. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by defining rules for date manipulation, including handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including subtraction of days.\n\n2. **Calculate Birthday Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's birthday date for a given year. Since she was born on the last day of February, the rule should find the last day of February in the specified year.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that recursively subtracts a single day from the date until the specified number of days is reached.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, subtracting a day from March 1 should result in February 28 or 29, depending on leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Create a helper predicate `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to check if a given year is a leap year.

Since Jane is turning 16, it means 16 years have passed since her birth year, 2001, which brings us to the year 2017. February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year. Since 2001 is not a leap year, Jane was born on February 28, 2001. Her 16th birthday would be on February 28, 2017. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be March 1, 2017, which can be represented as 03/01/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a birthdate and an age. The key steps include determining the current year based on the age, calculating the correct birthday for a leap year or common year, and then adding 24 hours to that date. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, handling leap years, and managing year and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Age Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Represent age as a number of years.\n\n2. **Calculate Current Year:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the current year based on the birth year and the given age. In this case, the current year is 2017, as it is Jane's 16th birthday.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for determining the correct birthday date in February.\n\n4. **Calculate Birthday Date:**\n   - Define a rule to calculate the birthday date for a given birth year and age. If the birth year is a leap year, the birthday date in February should be February 29; otherwise, it should be February 28.\n\n5. **Increment Date for 24 Hours:**\n   - Write a rule to increment a given date by 24 hours, considering month and year transitions.

To find today's date, we need to calculate the date exactly 50 years after their wedding date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date a specific number of years (50 years) after a given date. The challenge is to handle the addition of multiple years, considering potential leap years and transitions through month and year boundaries. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years to dates.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), YearsToAdd, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n\n3. **Handling Year Addition:**\n   - Within the `add_years` function, implement logic to increment the year by the specified number of years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - After adding years, adjust the month and day as needed. If the resulting date lands in a month with fewer days, adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple years, considering potential month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the number of years added and the resulting month and day adjustments.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including adding years across month and year boundaries, leap years, and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles adding various numbers of years, such as 50 years, 100 years, and years that span across century boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute today's date based on the anniversary date and the number of years passed, handling all necessary date transitions and special cases, such as leap years and month/year boundaries.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is being celebrated today. Given that they married on January 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary occurs 50 years later, on January 2, 2008. To find the date 10 days before this anniversary, we need to subtract 10 days from January 2, 2008.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting a certain number of days from a given date. The challenge is to handle the subtraction of days across potential month and year boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from January 2, 2008, will not cross any month or year boundaries, but the logic should be general enough to handle such cases. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date subtraction and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle date arithmetic, including subtraction.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from January 2, 2008, should result in January 1, 2008.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month and year when subtracting days. If the day becomes zero, decrement the month. If the month becomes zero, decrement the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including subtracting days across month and year boundaries, leap years, and non-leap years.\n   - For example, subtract 10 days from January 2, 2008, and verify the result as December 23, 2007.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and a number of days to subtract, returning the resulting date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date a certain number of days in the past, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as month and year boundaries and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date based on the information that Jane started her job in 2016 and today is her 3-year work anniversary. Additionally, she recalls that on her second day at work, December 2, she spilled coffee on her laptop. This means that her first day at work was December 1, 2016, and today is her work anniversary, exactly three years later. Therefore, today's date is December 1, 2019, which can be represented as 12/01/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly three years after December 1, 2016. This involves adding three years to the year component of the date and ensuring that the month and day remain the same. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation, considering the transition between months and years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between months and years correctly, especially when adding multiple years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to the next and from one year to the next when adding years. For example, adding one year to January 31, 2023, should result in February 28, 2024 (in a non-leap year).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during year additions.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple years, considering the possibility of transitioning through multiple month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the input date and the number of years added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_years` function with various dates and numbers of years, including transitions between months and years, and during leap and non-leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Apply the `add_years` function with `Years` set to 3 to the date December 1, 2016, to find today's date, which is exactly three years later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute today's date based on the given information about Jane's work anniversary, handling month and year transitions and considering leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from Jane's three-year work anniversary, which is today. Given that she started working in 2016 and today is her work anniversary, it can be deduced that today's date is December 1, 2019. The event of spilling coffee on her laptop happened the day after, which was December 2, 2019. The date one month ago from December 2, 2019, would be November 2, 2019. This date can be represented as 11/02/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month prior to a given date, considering potential month and year transitions. In this case, we are moving from December to November, which involves a simple month decrement. However, we must also consider the possibility of crossing a year boundary if the date was in January or February. In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for month subtraction and handling year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from Jane's work anniversary, which is December 2, assuming the current year is 2019 (three years after she got the job in 2016). Given that her second day at work was December 2, today would be her work anniversary, December 2, 2019. The date 24 hours later would be December 3, 2019, represented as 12/03/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the day within the same month and year. The key is to handle the transition from one day to the next without crossing any month or year boundaries. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including day increments, and handle month and year transitions, though they are not applicable in this specific case.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month and year. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 2, the next date should be December 3, 2019.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this case, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is December and the day increment goes beyond December 31.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years, though it does not apply in this case.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering potential month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions within the same month, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions, though the latter two are not directly applicable to this specific case.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling both regular and boundary cases like month and year transitions, though in this specific instance, only a simple day increment is required.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To find the date tomorrow, we need to calculate today's date by adding 176 days to March 20, 2020, and then add one more day for tomorrow's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date arithmetic, specifically adding a large number of days to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transitions between months and years as the number of days added spans a significant period. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these transitions and correctly calculate the resulting date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - In the base case, if `Days` is 0, `NewDate` should be the same as the input date.\n   - In the recursive case, use `increment_day` to add one day and then recursively call `add_days` with `Days` decremented by 1.\n\n3. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month and year boundaries.\n   - If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment it.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1. Handle December separately to increment the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date when incrementing days and transitioning between months and years.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various numbers of days to ensure correct transitions between months and years, including leap years.\n   - Test cases should include adding days that span across month and year boundaries, such as adding 176 days to March 20, 2020.\n\n7. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to add 176 days to March 20, 2020, to find today's date.\n   - Then, use the `increment_day` rule to add one more day to find tomorrow's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately calculate tomorrow's date based on the given information, handling all necessary date transitions and considering leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from today's date, which is 176 days after March 20, 2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting a number of days from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transitions between months and years when subtracting days. In this case, we need to consider that March has 31 days, so subtracting one day from March 20 would result in March 19. However, subtracting 176 days will likely span across multiple months and possibly years, requiring careful handling of these transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date, considering month-end transitions. If the day is not the last day of the month, simply decrement the day. Otherwise, decrement the month and set the day to the last day of the new month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, if the month is January and the day is 1, subtracting one day should result in December of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years. If a leap year is detected, adjust the number of days in February accordingly.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from a given date, considering a certain number of days (176 days) have passed since then. Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, which can be represented as 03/20/2020 in MM/DD/YYYY format. The goal is to calculate the date one month prior to this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month before March 20, 2020, taking into account the 176 days that have passed. This involves understanding how many months are covered by 176 days and then subtracting that number of months from the original date. In this case, 176 days is approximately 5.78 months, so we need to subtract 5 or 6 months from the original date, depending on whether we round up or down.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days and months.\n\n2. **Calculate Months Passed:**\n   - Write a function `days_to_months(Days, Months)` to convert the number of days to months. This function should handle cases where the number of days does not evenly divide into months.\n\n3. **Subtract Months from Date:**\n   - Develop a function `subtract_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Months, NewDate)` to subtract a given number of months from a date. This function should handle month-end and year-end transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if subtracting a month results in a date that is before the start of that month. If so, adjust the date to the last day of the previous month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple months, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to correctly apply rules for month subtraction, ensuring that the date is adjusted appropriately based on the number of months being subtracted.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_months` function with various scenarios, including subtracting a single month, multiple months, and months that span across year boundaries.\n   - Verify that the function correctly handles month-end transitions, such as subtracting a month from January 31 or February 28/29 in leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one month ago from a given date, considering the number of days that have passed. This will involve defining functions for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the input date and number of days.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To solve this, we need to calculate today's date by adding 176 days to March 20, 2020, and then subtracting one week (7 days) from that result.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date arithmetic, including adding a large number of days and then subtracting a smaller number of days. The challenge is to handle the transitions between months and years correctly, especially when adding 176 days, which will likely span across multiple months and possibly years. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` to add a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle month and year transitions, adjusting the month and year as needed.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToSubtract, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - This function can be similar to `add_days`, but with day subtraction logic.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if adding days results in a date like April 31, the function should adjust it to May 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition and subtraction of multiple days, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added or subtracted.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions with various scenarios, including transitions between months, years, and leap years.\n   - Verify that the functions correctly handle cases like adding 176 days and subtracting 7 days.\n\n9. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to add 176 days to March 20, 2020, to find today's date.\n\n10. **Calculate Date One Week Ago:**\n    - Use the `subtract_days` function to subtract 7 days from today's date to determine the date one week ago.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date one week ago from today, considering all necessary date transitions and special cases, such as leap years and month-end boundaries.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that the year 2015 will arrive in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours is equal to 1 day and 12 hours. This means that in 12 hours, it will be January 1, 2015. Therefore, today's date is December 31, 2014, or 12/31/2014 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the current date based on the information that a specific future date (January 1, 2015) will occur in 36 hours. This involves subtracting time from a known future date to determine the current date. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation, including the ability to subtract time intervals.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use structures like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(Hours)` to represent dates and time intervals.\n   - Ensure these structures can handle arithmetic operations for subtraction.\n\n2. **Time Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_time(time(H1), time(H2), Result)` to subtract two time intervals, resulting in a new time interval. For example, `subtract_time(time(36), time(12), time(24))`.\n\n3. **Date Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule `subtract_date(date(MM1, DD1, YYYY1), Days, date(MM2, DD2, YYYY2))` to subtract a number of days from a given date, resulting in a new date. This will handle transitions between months and years.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_date` rule, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, subtracting 1 day from January 1 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied for date subtraction, especially when dealing with month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_date` rule with various scenarios, including transitions between months (e.g., subtracting days from January 2), transitions between years (e.g., subtracting days from December 31), and during leap years (e.g., February 29 to February 28).\n\n8. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Given the future date (January 1, 2015), use the `subtract_date` rule to subtract 1 day and 12 hours to find today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine today's date based on a future date and a time interval, handling month and year transitions and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date and time arithmetic, utilizing Prolog's pattern matching, and providing test cases to ensure accurate results.",

First, we need to calculate today's date based on the information provided. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be one and a half days from now, which means today is December 31, 2014. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two parts: calculating today's date and then determining the date 10 days prior to that date. The challenge lies in handling the transition from one year to the next, as the calculation will span the change from December 2014 to January 2015. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this transition correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate today's date based on the given information.

This function should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_days` function, include logic to check if the resulting day is less than 1.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago, given that the year 2015 is arriving in 36 hours. First, we need to calculate today's date, which is 36 hours before the start of 2015. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours is equal to 1 day and 12 hours. Therefore, today's date is December 30, 2014. Now, we need to calculate the date one month ago from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform two main calculations: finding today's date and then calculating the date one month prior. The first calculation involves subtracting 36 hours from the start of 2015, which can be done with basic time arithmetic. The second calculation requires understanding month transitions and potentially year transitions, as subtracting one month from December may lead to the previous year. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to handle these calculations and transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including hour subtraction and month subtraction.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract 36 hours from a given date. In this case, subtract 1 day and 12 hours from January 1, 2015, to find today's date (December 30, 2014).\n\n3. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handle Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the previous year when subtracting a month from January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a function to check for leap years, which is important for handling February correctly during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of today's date and the date one month ago. This will involve repeatedly subtracting hours and then months.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the correct rules for hour subtraction and month subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including transitions between months and years, and during leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month ago, considering the specified conditions and handling date transitions effectively.",

        "question": "2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later, given that the year 2015 is arriving in 36 hours. First, we need to calculate today's date based on the information provided. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be one and a half days from now. This means that today's date is December 30, 2014. \n\nNow, to find the date 24 hours later, we simply need to add one day to today's date, which would be December 31, 2014. This date can be represented as 12/31/2014 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two parts: calculating today's date based on the given information and then adding 24 hours to that date. The challenge lies in handling the transition from one year to another, as the calculation spans the end of the year. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day and year increments.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate today's date based on the given information. In this case, \"2015 is coming in 36 hours\" means that in 36 hours, it will be January 1, 2015. So, today's date is December 30, 2014.\n\n3. **Add 24 Hours Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to add 24 hours to a given date, considering the transition between days, months, and years. This rule should handle cases where the addition crosses month and year boundaries.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month and year when adding days. For example, if adding 24 hours takes us from December 31 to January 1, the year should increment by 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check for leap years, which is important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve crossing month and year boundaries, such as adding 24 hours to December 30, 2014, or adding 48 hours to December 31, 2014.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 24 hours later, taking into account the transition from one year to the next. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

By swapping the day and month, the date in the standard format is 01/02/1987.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves rearranging the components of a date to match a different format. The challenge is to correctly identify and swap the day and month parts of the date while keeping the year intact. In Prolog, this can be achieved by breaking down the input date, manipulating the components, and then reassembling them in the desired order.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Input Date Representation:**\n   - Start by representing the input date as a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to match the UK format.\n\n2. **Swap Day and Month:**\n   - Define a rule to swap the values of `DD` and `MM`, effectively converting the date to the desired format. This can be done by creating a new structure with the swapped values.\n\n3. **Output Date Representation:**\n   - Define a new structure, `standard_date(MM, DD, YYYY)`, to represent the date in the standard MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n4. **Conversion Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that takes an input date in the UK format and applies the swap operation to create a date in the standard format.

        "question": "In the UK, people usually put the day before the month when formatting the date. Therefore, today is 02/01/1987 to them. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that today's date in the UK format is 02/01/1987. In the UK, the day is placed before the month, so this date corresponds to February 1, 1987, in the US format. Therefore, the date yesterday would be January 31, 1987, or 01/31/1987 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one day to the previous one, considering the month and year boundaries. In this case, we are subtracting one day from the given date, which involves decrementing the day value and checking for month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day, month, and year decrements.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from the given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day value.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day becomes 0, decrement the month and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n   - Special handling is needed for January, where the year should also be decremented.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days if needed. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days have been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions, leap years, and non-leap years. For example, test subtracting a day from January 1, February 28, and February 29 during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date for yesterday based on the input date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years.",

If `Days` is greater than `DD`, decrement `Days` by `DD` and then decrement `MM` by 1, treating it as a \"borrow\" from the next month. If `MM` becomes 0, decrement `YYYY` by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_days` function, include logic to handle the transition from one month to the previous one, considering different month lengths. For example, if today is February 1, subtracting 7 days should lead to January 25.\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion in the `subtract_days` function to repeatedly subtract a single day until `Days` reaches 0. This will handle subtracting any number of days, including across month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month and year transitions within the `subtract_days` function. This will ensure that the date subtraction is accurate, even when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the `subtract_days` function for various scenarios, including normal day subtraction, month-end transitions, and year transitions. For example, subtracting 7 days from February 1, 1987, should result in January 25, 1987.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute a date one week ago from a given date in the UK format, handling date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is July 28, 2002 (given that Jane booked a flight for July 29, 2002). To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current date. This involves handling the transition from one year to the previous one, considering the number of days in each month and potentially adjusting for leap years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting one year from a given date. This requires understanding how to decrement the year, handle month and day adjustments, and account for leap years. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including year subtraction, and handle the necessary transitions and adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) by 1 and then adjusting the month and day as needed.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the year subtraction rule, include logic to handle the transition from one month to another and adjust the day as needed. For example, if the current date is July 28, subtracting one year should result in July 28 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during the year subtraction. If the original date is in February and it is a leap year, the resulting date may need to be adjusted to the last day of February in non-leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to another, considering month and day adjustments. This will ensure that the correct date is calculated even when crossing month boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will help in handling various scenarios, such as transitioning from a leap year to a non-leap year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as subtracting a year from February 29 in a leap year, from December 31, and from a regular day in a non-leap year. Verify that the program correctly handles month and day adjustments, leap years, and regular year transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one year ago from a given date, considering all necessary adjustments and transitions, including leap years.",

To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from July 29, 2002. This calculation will lead us to the date July 22, 2002, which can be represented as 07/22/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a specific number of days (7 days) from a given date while handling potential month and year transitions. In this case, subtracting 7 days from July 29 does not cross any month or year boundaries, so the solution is straightforward. However, in Prolog, we need to define rules that can handle more complex transitions, such as when subtracting days results in a date in the previous month or year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day subtraction and potential month and year adjustments.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day becomes 0, increment the month by 1 and set the day to the last day of the new month. Consider leap years when determining the number of days in February.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the previous year when subtracting days.

This will involve repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date structure during the day subtraction process.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day subtraction, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after July 29, 2002, which is the date of Jane's booked flight. Given that there are 24 hours in a day, the date 24 hours later would simply be the next day, July 30, 2002, represented as 07/30/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day within the same month and year. The solution requires a basic understanding of date manipulation, adding one day to the given date, and ensuring that the month and year remain the same. In SWI-Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date arithmetic, specifically for incrementing days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month and year. For example, if `MM` is 7 (July), `DD` is 29, and `YYYY` is 2002, then adding 24 hours should result in the date July 30, 2002.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not relevant for this specific date, include a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Similarly, include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds 12 (December).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering potential month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling basic date arithmetic and considering potential month and year transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday based on the information that Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, starting from October 2009, and today is her 5th visit. This problem involves calculating the date of the 5th occurrence of the 16th of the month, starting from a given date. By subtracting one day from this calculated date, we can find the date of yesterday.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, considering the fixed day (16th) and incrementing the month and year accordingly for each occurrence. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to iterate through the months and years, keeping track of the number of visits. Once we reach the 5th visit, we can subtract one day to find the date of yesterday.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for incrementing months and years.\n\n2. **Bookstore Visit Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that calculates the date of Jane's bookstore visit based on the fixed day (16th) and the current month and year. This rule should increment the month and year accordingly for each visit.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if the current month is December, the next visit should be in January of the following year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to iterate through each month and year, applying the bookstore visit rule until the 5th visit is reached.\n\n6. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Once the date of the 5th visit is calculated, write a function to subtract one day from that date to find the date of yesterday.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to correctly apply the bookstore visit rule based on the current date and the fixed day (16th).\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with different starting dates and visit numbers to ensure the correct dates are calculated.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, which occurs on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. To solve this, we need to calculate the date of her fifth visit and then subtract 10 days from that date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating the date of Jane's fifth visit and then subtracting 10 days from that date. The first step requires understanding the pattern of her visits (16th of each month) and performing date arithmetic to reach the fifth occurrence. The second step involves handling date subtraction, including month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to achieve these steps.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\n\n2. **Jane's Visit Pattern:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's visits based on the pattern: the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. This involves adding months to the initial date and stopping after five additions.\n\n3. **Date Addition Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Months, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of months to a given date. Handle month-end and year-end transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Date Subtraction Function:**\n   - Create a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. Handle month and year transitions correctly, similar to the addition function.\n\n5. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid when subtracting days.

To solve this, we need to calculate the date of her fifth visit and then determine the date one month prior to that. This problem involves date arithmetic, including handling month boundaries and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo approach this problem, we can break it down into two parts: calculating the date of Jane's fifth visit and then finding the date one month before that. We can use Prolog's capabilities for date manipulation and recursion to handle these calculations effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting months.\n\n2. **Jane's Bookstore Visit Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's bookstore visit based on the given pattern: the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. This rule should handle month-to-month progression and year transitions correctly.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date.

Otherwise, simply decrement the month, considering the number of days in each month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting a month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, which occurs on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. To solve this, we need to calculate the date of her fifth visit and then subtract one year from that date. Jane's fifth visit would be on February 16, 2010, and the date one year before that would be February 16, 2009, or 02/16/2009 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating the date of Jane's fifth visit and then subtracting one year from that date. The first step requires understanding the pattern of her visits (16th of each month) and using date arithmetic to reach the fifth occurrence. The second step involves subtracting one year, which may require handling month and day adjustments for shorter months. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these calculations and adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting months and years.\n\n2. **Jane's Visit Pattern:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's visits based on the pattern: 16th of each month starting from October 2009. This rule should increment the month by one until reaching the fifth visit.\n\n3. **Add Months Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Months, NewDate)` to add a specified number of months to a given date. This function should handle month-end and year-end transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Subtract Years Function:**\n   - Create a function `subtract_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of years from a given date. This function should adjust the month and day correctly for shorter months and handle year transitions.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement logic to handle month-end and year-end transitions when adding or subtracting months or years. For example, if adding months takes us to February 30, it should adjust to February 29 in leap years and February 28 in non-leap years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the current date and the number of months or years to add or subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various scenarios, including adding and subtracting months and years, handling month-end and year-end transitions, and considering leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate Jane's fifth visit date and then determine the date one year before that, taking into account all necessary date adjustments and transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, which occurs on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. Given that today is her fifth visit, we can calculate the current date by counting five months from the starting date of October 2009 and then setting the day to the 16th. From there, we can add 24 hours to get the date 24 hours later.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, taking into account the fixed day (16th) and the interval of one month between visits. We can use Prolog to define rules for date manipulation, including adding months and days to a given date. The challenge is to handle month boundaries and year transitions correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding months and days.\n\n2. **Add Months Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Months, NewDate)` to add a specified number of months to a given date.\n   - Handle month-end transitions correctly, considering different month lengths.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to add a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - Handle day overflows correctly, adjusting the month and year if needed.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_months` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, adding one month to March should result in April, but adding one month to December should result in January of the following year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Calculate Jane's Current Visit Date:**\n   - Use the `add_months` function to calculate the date of Jane's fifth visit by adding 5 months to the starting date of October 2009. Set the day to 16 for each visit.\n\n7. **Date 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to calculate the date 24 hours later by adding 1 day to Jane's fifth visit date.\n\n8. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to implement the `add_months` and `add_days` functions, correctly applying rules for month and day additions.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various scenarios, including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years, to ensure accurate results.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours after Jane's fifth visit to the bookstore, considering the specified conditions and handling date arithmetic effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the correct date today, given that Jane thought it was March 11, 2002, but in reality, it is one day later. This means that today's date is March 12, 2002, which can be represented as 03/12/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves correcting a mistaken date by adding one day to it. This requires understanding how to increment a date by a single day, considering the transition between months and handling potential year changes. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the current month, the rule should adjust the day and increment the month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months. If the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month, the rule should set the day to 1 and increment the month. For example, if the date is March 31, incrementing by one day should result in April 1.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle year transitions when incrementing days. If the incremented month exceeds 12 (December), the rule should reset the month to 1 (January) and increment the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month and year transitions.

In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting a month.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January or February, decrement the year and set the month to December or January, respectively. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - When subtracting a month, adjust the day component to match the number of days in the resulting month. If the original day is greater than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year. This is crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years. If the year is a leap year, February has 29 days; otherwise, it has 28 days.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering potential year transitions. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in selecting the correct path based on the current date structure.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the month subtraction rule with various dates, including transitions between months and years, to ensure it handles all scenarios accurately.\n   - Specifically, test cases for February should be included to verify the correct handling of leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month ago from a given date, considering month transitions and adjusting the day as needed. This will involve defining rules for month subtraction and handling day adjustments based on the target month.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from the first day of 2007. Given that today is January 1, 2007, the date 10 days ago would be in the previous month, December of the previous year, 2006. Counting back 10 days from January 1, we arrive at December 22, 2006. Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 12/22/2006 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate a date that is 10 days before a given date, considering the transition from one month to another and one year to another. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling month and year transitions. The key is to recognize the month and year changes when decrementing days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations for subtracting days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month and year when subtracting days. If the day is 1, decrement the month (`MM`) and reset the day to the last day of the previous month. If the month is January, decrement the year (`YYYY`) and set the month to December.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 in this case) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including subtracting days across month and year boundaries, such as from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date 10 days prior. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days before a given date, considering month and year transitions, and handling leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

This date can be represented as 12/26/2006 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) before the given date.

Implement this function using recursion, decrementing `Days` and repeatedly calling the function until `Days` reaches 0.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if the day reaches 1, decrement the month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is the first day of the year 2007. This calculation involves adding seven days to the current date, which is January 1, 2007. Therefore, the date one week from today would be January 8, 2007, represented as 01/08/2007 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to add seven days to the given date while considering month and year boundaries. Since January has 31 days, adding seven days will not cross into a new month or year. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments and month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month and year transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. If `DD` reaches the maximum number of days in the current month, the rule should set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when `DD` exceeds the maximum days in the current month. This rule should adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year when `MM` is December and `DD` exceeds the maximum days in December. This rule should increment `YYYY` and reset `MM` and `DD`.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Create a predicate to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add seven days to the given date. This will involve repeatedly applying the day increment rule until the desired number of days has been added.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct rules are applied based on the current date, month, and year.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those near the end of a month or year, to ensure correct transitions are made. For example, test adding seven days to December 31, 2006, which should result in January 7, 2007.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from a given date, handling day increments and month and year transitions correctly.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane's appointment, which is three days after April 10, 1985, and then find the date for the day after that appointment. Today's date is April 10, 1985, and Jane's appointment will be on April 13, 1985, which is three days later. The date tomorrow, which is the day after the appointment, will be April 14, 1985, represented as 04/14/1985 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform two main operations: first, calculate the date of Jane's appointment, which is three days after the given date, and second, find the date for the day after the appointment. This involves basic date arithmetic, including incrementing the day and handling month and year transitions if necessary. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month and year transitions.\n\n2. **Date Incrementation Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Increment, NewDate)` to increment a date by a specified number of days (`Increment`). If `DD` + `Increment` exceeds the days in `MM`, then `MM` should be incremented, and `DD` should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `increment_date` rule to handle transitions between months. For example, if incrementing from March 31, the next date should be April 1.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle year transitions when incrementing from December to January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to increment the date by the desired number of days. For example, to increment by three days, call `increment_date` three times recursively.\n\n7. **Finding Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - After calculating the date for Jane's appointment, use the `increment_date` rule one more time to find the date for the day after the appointment.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days to increment.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including month-end and year-end transitions, to ensure that the date increments correctly and that leap years are handled accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate dates a certain number of days in the future, handle month and year transitions, and find the date for the day after a specified appointment date.",

To find the date of yesterday, we need to subtract one day from today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of a single day from a given date. This involves understanding the transition between days within the same month. In this case, subtracting one day from April 10, 1985, would result in April 9, 1985. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, including day subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 10, then subtracting one day should result in April 9, 1985.\n\n3. **Handling First Day of the Month:**\n   - Implement a special case for subtracting one day from the first day of the month. In this case, the month should be decremented, and the day should be set to the last day of the previous month. For instance, subtracting one day from April 1, 1985, would result in March 31, 1985.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end transitions and leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct rule is applied based on the input date, whether it is the first day of the month or a regular day.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve regular day subtraction and month-end transitions, such as subtracting one day from April 10, 1985, or January 1, 2023.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one day prior to a given date, handling both regular and end-of-month cases.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from Jane's appointment date, which is three days after April 10, 1985. First, we need to calculate the date of Jane's appointment by adding three days to April 10, 1985, resulting in April 13, 1985. Then, to find the date one month ago from this appointment date, we need to subtract one month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two parts: calculating a date some days ahead and then subtracting one month from that date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years when subtracting time. In this case, subtracting one month from April takes us back to March. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and managing date overflows.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding days and subtracting months.\n\n2. **Date Addition:**\n   - Write a rule to add a specified number of days to a given date. This rule should handle cases where the addition causes a transition to the next month or year.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when adding days. For example, adding 3 days to April 10 should result in April 13.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle year transitions when adding days. For instance, adding days to December should roll over to January of the next year.\n\n5. **Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, the subtraction should result in December of the previous year.\n\n6. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to add or subtract days, months, or years, ensuring that the correct rules are applied based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for date addition, month subtraction, and handling month and year transitions.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including transitions between months and years, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is April 10, 1985, and Jane's appointment is in three days. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate today's date plus seven days, considering any month or year transitions that may occur during this interval.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date arithmetic, specifically adding seven days to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another. In this case, adding seven days to April 10, 1985, will result in a date in the same month (April) but in a different year (1985 to 1986). Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, including handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle month and year transitions correctly, incrementing the month or year as needed.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `add_days` to check if adding the specified number of days crosses a month boundary. If so, increment the month and reset the day to 1 if necessary.\n   - Special handling is needed for December, where adding enough days will result in a new year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that adds a single day and then recursively calls itself until the specified number of days has been added.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, adding days that cross into a new month, and adding days that span across a year transition.\n\n8. **Calculate Target Date:**\n   - Given today's date, use the `add_days` function to calculate the date for Jane's appointment (3 days later) and then the date one week from today's date (7 days later).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute dates a certain number of days in the future, considering month and year transitions, and handling leap years.

In Prolog, we can use rules and arithmetic operations to calculate the date interval and then add this interval to the date of the first observation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding intervals.\n\n2. **Meteor Shower Interval:**\n   - Define a constant or a rule to determine the typical interval between meteor showers. This could be a fixed number of days or a more complex pattern. For simplicity, let's assume meteor showers occur every two months.\n\n3. **Calculate Second Observation Date:**\n   - Write a rule that takes the date of the first observation and adds the meteor shower interval to it. This rule should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding the interval. For example, adding two months to January 31 should result in March 31 of the same year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various first observation dates to ensure the second observation date is calculated correctly, considering month and year transitions and leap years.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that asks for the date of the first meteor shower observation and returns the date of the second observation.\n\n8. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle more complex meteor shower patterns, such as quarterly or biannual showers, by applying the interval multiple times.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of Jane's second meteor shower observation in 1973, considering the interval between meteor showers and handling date transitions correctly. This will involve date arithmetic, pattern matching, and potentially recursive rules for more complex shower patterns.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that today is Jane's second meteor shower observation in the year 1973, which falls on March 5. To find the date of tomorrow, we need to add one day to today's date. This involves handling the progression of dates within a month and potentially across months and years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day, considering the possibility of crossing month and year boundaries. In this case, incrementing March 5 by one day will result in March 6. The challenge is to define rules that can handle such date arithmetic, taking into account the varying number of days in each month and the transition between months and years. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation and using its pattern matching and recursion capabilities.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for incrementing days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to add one day to a given date.\n   - This rule should handle the transition from one day to the next within the same month.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 31, the next date should be April 1, with `MM` becoming 4 and `DD` resetting to 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year. This involves incrementing the year and resetting the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates the date a certain number of days in the future. This rule should repeatedly apply the `increment_day` rule until the desired number of days has been added.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date, such as identifying month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from March 31 to April 1, from December 31 to January 1, and from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of tomorrow based on the given information, handling date arithmetic and transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

The function should repeatedly call itself to subtract a single day until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct rule to apply when subtracting days, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that validate the `subtract_days` function for various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, subtracting 10 days from March 5, 1973, should result in February 24, 1973.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for 10 Days Ago:**\n   - Use the `subtract_days` function with `Days` set to 10 to calculate the date 10 days ago from March 5, 1973.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 10 days ago from a given date, considering month and year transitions and handling leap years. This will involve defining rules for date subtraction and utilizing Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 5, the next date should be March 6, 1973.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific case, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering potential month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions within the same month, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions to ensure the program handles all scenarios correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 24 hours later from the given input, considering potential date transitions and special cases, although in this specific instance, a simple day increment is all that is required.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days prior to January 21, 2011, which was a Friday. Subtracting 10 days from this date would land on a Thursday, January 11, 2011. This date can be represented as 01/11/2011 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate a date that is 10 days before a given date, considering the transition between months and years. In this case, the calculation does not involve crossing any month or year boundaries, so the solution is a simple subtraction of 10 days from the given date. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation and subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle subtraction operations for days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month and year if the day subtraction results in a date before the start of the current month. For example, if the date is January 2 and we subtract 5 days, the result should be in December of the previous year.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting days. If the resulting day is 0, set it to the last day of the previous month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 in this case) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently apply the correct rules for day and month transitions, ensuring the date 10 days ago is calculated accurately.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting 10 days from January 5 or December 31.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles subtracting various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 10 days prior to a given date, handling various date transitions and special cases, including month and year changes.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is implied to be January 22, 2012, based on the narrative. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date, considering the transition between years and the number of days in each month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting one year from a given date, which can be achieved by decrementing the year and then adjusting the month and day as needed to maintain a valid date. In this case, subtracting one year from January 22, 2012, would result in a date in 2011, but we need to account for the number of days in each month to determine the correct month and day.

If the current year is not a leap year, this rule should simply decrement the year. However, if the current year is a leap year, and the date is in February or later, the year subtraction should also decrement the day by one for dates in February or later.\n\n3. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement rules to adjust the month and day after subtracting a year. For example, if the original date is January 31, 2012, subtracting one year should result in January 31, 2011, which is invalid.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today's date, which is implied to be shortly after January 21, 2011, based on the narrative context. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date. Given that today is likely within a few days after January 21, 2011, the date one week ago would be around January 14, 2011.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a specific number of days (7 days) from a date that falls within a known range (a few days after January 21, 2011). The challenge is to handle the subtraction of days while considering month and year boundaries. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the correct date between two conflicting claims: Jane's belief that today is June 18, 2019, and John's belief that today is June 19, 2019. To resolve this, we need to analyze the validity of both claims and provide the correct date. In this case, Jane's claim of June 18, 2019, is correct.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compare the two dates and determine which one is valid for \"today.\" This involves understanding the structure of dates and performing a simple comparison to identify the correct date. In Prolog, we can use date structures and built-in comparison operators to validate the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle comparison operations.\n\n2. **Comparison Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that compares two dates using the `>` or `<` operator to determine which date is later. For example, `date(6, 18, 2019) < date(6, 19, 2019)` should be true.\n\n3. **Validation Rule:**\n   - Create a rule that validates a given date as \"today\" based on the comparison with the other date. For instance, if Jane's date is earlier than John's date, then Jane's date is \"today.\"\n\n4. **User Interaction:**\n   - Prompt the user to input Jane's and John's dates and then apply the comparison and validation rules to determine the correct date for \"today.\"\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the comparison rule for different date combinations, ensuring that the correct date is identified as \"today.\"\n\n6. **Handling Invalid Inputs:**\n   - Implement error handling for invalid date inputs, such as incorrect month or day values.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific problem, consider using recursive rules to handle more complex date comparisons or calculations.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that can compare two dates and identify the correct one as \"today,\" taking into account the structure of dates and using comparison operators.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nGiven that Jane is correct and today is June 18, 2019, the task is to determine the date ten days ago from this date. Calculating ten days ago involves subtracting ten days from June 18, 2019, which will result in a date in the past.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days from a given date, considering the transition between months and potentially years. Since June has 30 days, subtracting ten days will take us back to an earlier date in the same month. The solution requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day values accordingly during the subtraction process. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n   - For example, if `MM` is 6 (June) and `DD` is 18, subtracting one day should result in June 17, 2019.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day becomes 0, decrement the month and set the day to the last day of the new month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from June 1 would result in May 31, not May 0.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case for the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 in this case) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct transition is applied based on the current date during the day subtraction process.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries. Test cases should also cover leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date ten days ago from a given date, handling month and year transitions correctly and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date subtraction and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nGiven that Jane is correct and today is June 18, 2019, the task is to determine the date one week from today. To find the date one week later, we need to add seven days to the current date. This calculation will result in a date of June 25, 2019, which can be represented as 06/25/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic by adding seven days to the given date. This involves understanding how to increment days, months, and years correctly. In this case, the addition of seven days does not cross any month or year boundaries, so the solution is straightforward. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation and use recursion to add the specified number of days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle normal day increments and month/year transitions if the addition crosses month or year boundaries.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the current month. If so, adjust the day and month accordingly (e.g., from June 30 to July 1).\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from December to January if the addition crosses the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a function to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly call `add_days` until the desired number of days (7 days) has been added.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various inputs, including dates near the end of a month or year, to ensure correct handling of transitions.\n\n9. **Calculate the Date One Week Later:**\n   - Using the `add_days` function, add 7 days to the given date (June 18, 2019) to find the date one week later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from a given date, handling day increments and month/year transitions correctly. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from June 18, 2019, given that Jane's belief of the date is correct. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the date 24 hours later would simply be the next day, June 19, 2019, which can be represented as 06/19/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross any month or year boundaries, which is not a concern in this specific case. In SWI-Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day component of the date structure.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 6 (June) and `DD` is 18, the next date should be June 19, 2019.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific case, include a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This will ensure that the code works correctly for any date.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Similarly, include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is December, and the incremented day falls outside the days of December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering potential month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on a given input date, handling both simple and more complex date transitions.",

In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation and use pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the input date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for incrementing days and months.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering the transition between the last day of a month to the first day of the next month.\n   - For example, if `MM` is 6 (June) and `DD` is 30, the next date should be July 1, as June has 30 days.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition between months when incrementing days. This involves checking the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day values accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years. If the year is a leap year, February will have 29 days instead of the usual 28.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for incrementing the date by any number of days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will enable the program to automatically handle various date scenarios.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years. For example, test the transition from June 30 to July 1 and from December 31 to January 1.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month transitions. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is June 19, 2019. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current date. This involves handling the transition from one year to another, going from 2019 to 2018, and determining the corresponding date in June 2018.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting one year from a given date. This involves understanding how to decrement the year component of a date and handling any adjustments to the month and day components that may be necessary due to varying month lengths and leap years. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation, including year subtraction, and handling month and day adjustments accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting years.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from a given date.\n   - If `MM` is January or February, and the resulting year is a leap year, ensure that the day adjustment is handled correctly for leap years.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the `subtract_year` function, include logic to adjust the month and day components as needed. For example, if the original date is March 31, 2019, then one year earlier would be March 31, 2018, which is a valid date. However, if the original date is February 29, 2020, then one year earlier would be February 29, 2019, which is not a valid date in a non-leap year. In such cases, the day should be adjusted to the last day of February (28).\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month and day adjustments based on the current date and the year being subtracted.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including regular year-to-year transitions, transitions involving leap years, and cases where the day or month needs to be adjusted due to the varying number of days in different months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year prior to a given date, handling all necessary adjustments for month lengths and leap years. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and leveraging Prolog's pattern matching and search capabilities to apply those rules effectively.",

To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date. This calculation will result in the date June 26, 2019, which can be represented as 06/26/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date by adding a specified number of days (one week) to a given date.

In Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for date manipulation, including adding days and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` that adds `DaysToAdd` to the given date.\n   - If adding days results in a date beyond the number of days in the current month, the function should handle the transition to the next month.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to check if the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the current month. If so, increment the month and reset the day to 1.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle the transition from December to January by incrementing the year if the month transitions from December to January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add multiple days to a date. For example, to add 7 days, recursively call `add_days` with 1 day added at a time.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for adding days, transitioning between months, and handling leap years.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, transitioning between months, and handling leap years.

        "question": "May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, but that is actually ten years ago. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow based on the information that May 6, 1992, feels like yesterday to Jane, but it was actually ten years ago. If May 6, 1992, was ten years ago, then today's date is May 6, 2002, and tomorrow's date will be May 7, 2002, represented as 05/07/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate tomorrow's date by adding one day to today's date, which is ten years after May 6, 1992. This involves understanding date arithmetic, including handling the addition of days, months, and years. In Prolog, we can use rules and functions to perform these calculations, taking into account month lengths and leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - If adding days causes the date to exceed the number of days in the current month, the function should roll over to the next month and adjust the day count accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to handle transitions between months. If adding days causes the date to exceed the current month's length, increment the month and adjust the day count.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Add Months and Years Functions:**\n   - Create functions `add_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), MonthsToAdd, NewDate)` and `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), YearsToAdd, NewDate)` to handle the addition of months and years, respectively. These functions will utilize the `add_days` function and adjust the month and year accordingly.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules within the `add_days` function to handle the addition of multiple days, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to correctly apply rules for adding days, months, and years based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, adding days that span across months, adding months, and adding years. Test cases should also consider leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate tomorrow's date based on the given information. This involves defining functions for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to May 6, 1992, which is perceived as \"like yesterday\" by Jane but is actually ten years ago. To calculate the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from May 6, 1992, considering any necessary adjustments for month length and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting one month from a given date, taking into account the number of days in each month and handling the transition between years. In this case, subtracting one month from May 6, 1992, would result in a date in April 1992. We need to determine the correct day in April that corresponds to this date. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for date manipulation and month subtraction.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting months.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, the subtraction should result in the same day in December of the previous year. Otherwise, the month should simply be decremented.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day component when subtracting a month. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the new month, roll back to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering the varying number of days in each month and potential year transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month subtraction based on the current month and year. This will ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including month-end transitions (e.g., subtracting a month from May 31), year-end transitions (e.g., subtracting a month from January 1), and leap years (e.g., subtracting a month from February 29).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month prior to a given date, considering month length variations and year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that May 6, 1992, which is ten years ago, feels like yesterday to Jane. First, we need to calculate the current date by adding ten years to May 6, 1992, which results in May 6, 2002. Then, we need to subtract seven days from this date to find the date one week ago.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: adding ten years to a given date and then subtracting seven days from the resulting date. The challenge lies in handling the addition of years, which may involve leap years, and then correctly subtracting days while considering month and year boundaries. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling leap years and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), YearsToAdd, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - Consider leap years when adding years to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n3. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToSubtract, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - Handle month and year transitions when subtracting days, ensuring that the day remains valid for the resulting month.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding or subtracting time intervals. For example, subtracting a day from January 1 may result in December of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Create a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurate date calculations involving February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition and subtraction of time intervals.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that Jane feels like May 6, 1992, is like yesterday, but it was actually ten years ago. This problem involves two steps: first, calculating the current date by adding ten years to May 6, 1992, and second, adding seven days to that date to find the date one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including adding years and days to a given date. The first step is to add ten years to May 6, 1992, which can be done by incrementing the year component by 10. The second step is to add seven days to the resulting date, considering the transition between months and potentially between years. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation, handling month and year boundaries, and performing recursive operations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and days.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), YearsToAdd, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - If the resulting year is a leap year and the date falls in February, adjust the date to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle month and year transitions, such as rolling over to the next month or year if needed.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding days. For example, adding one day to January 31 should result in February 1, and adding one more day should result in February 2.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for accurate date calculations during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add multiple days or years to a date. For example, to add seven days, recursively call `add_days` seven times.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for adding days and years based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various dates, including those near month and year boundaries, to ensure correct transitions.\n   - Verify that the functions handle leap years correctly, especially when adding days to February during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date one week from today, even when starting from a date that feels like yesterday but is actually ten years ago.

The date 24 hours later would be May 7, 1982, represented as 05/07/1982 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a given past date. Specifically, we need to add one day to the given date, taking into account potential month and year transitions. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date manipulation, including handling month boundaries and year increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that adds one day to a given date. If the current day is not the last day of the month, simply increment the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the current day is the last day of the month. For example, if the date is May 31, adding one day should result in June 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the current date is December 31. Adding one day should result in January 1 of the following year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.

Therefore, Christmas Eve of 1937 would be December 24, 1937, represented as 12/24/1937 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to associate the given event, Christmas Eve, with its fixed date, December 24, and then specify the year, which is 1937 in this case. In Prolog, we can define rules that represent the relationship between events and their corresponding dates, allowing us to query the date of a specific event for a given year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle different months, days, and years.\n\n2. **Event-Date Association:**\n   - Create rules that associate events with their corresponding dates. For example, `christmas_eve(date(12, 24, YYYY))` would represent that Christmas Eve falls on December 24 for any given year.\n\n3. **Querying Event Date:**\n   - Write a query that asks for the date of a specific event in a particular year. For instance, `event_date(christmas_eve, date(MM, DD, 1937)).`\n\n4. **Handling Year Variations:**\n   - Ensure that the rules can handle different years by parameterizing the year in the event-date association rules. This will allow for querying the date of an event in any given year.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the event-date associations are correct for various events and years. For example, check the date of Christmas Eve for different years, such as 1937, 2023, and 2050.\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input an event and a year, and then displays the corresponding date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Christmas Eve of 1937. Christmas Eve is the day before Christmas, which is celebrated on December 25. Therefore, Christmas Eve falls on December 24, 1937, in this case. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is 10 days prior to a given date, specifically Christmas Eve of a given year. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days, as well as accounting for leap years. In Prolog, this can be accomplished by defining rules for date manipulation, including day subtraction, month transitions, and leap year checks.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Christmas Eve Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Christmas Eve for a given year. This involves finding the date that is one day before December 25.\n\n3. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day. Otherwise, roll back to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, decrement the month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days from a date. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct rules to apply for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as dates in January or February.\n   - Verify the correctness of the program for both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of determining the date 10 days before Christmas Eve of a given year, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as leap years and month/year rollovers.

Christmas Eve is celebrated on December 24th, so the date in question is December 24, 1937.

In this case, moving one month back from December to November is straightforward, but we also need to account for the number of days in November, which is 30.

If the current month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handle Day Overflow:**\n   - When subtracting a month, adjust the day component to match the last day of the resulting month if the original day is greater than the number of days in the resulting month.\n   - For example, if the original date is November 31, it should become November 30 after subtracting a month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering potential year transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month subtraction based on the current month and year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from January, February during leap and non-leap years, and other months with different day counts.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given that today is December 24, 1937, use the \"subtract a month\" rule to calculate the date one month ago.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month prior to a given date, handling month transitions and considering the number of days in each month.

        "question": "Today is Christmas Eve of 1937. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week before Christmas Eve of 1937. Christmas Eve falls on December 24th, so one week before that would be December 17th, 1937. This date can be represented as 12/17/1937 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) before a given date. This involves understanding the specific date of Christmas Eve and then performing a simple date subtraction, taking into account any month or year transitions that may occur during the subtraction. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic operations, including subtraction.\n\n2. **Christmas Eve Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Christmas Eve for a given year. Christmas Eve falls on December 24th each year, so this rule should set `MM` to 12 and `DD` to 24 for any given year.\n\n3. **Date Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should handle the transition between months and years correctly. For example, subtracting 7 days from December 24 should result in December 17.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to another when subtracting days. For instance, if the day becomes negative during subtraction, decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle February during leap years when performing date subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to another, considering month and year transitions. This will be useful for subtracting more than one day.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will help in automatically choosing the right path during date subtraction.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries. Test cases should also cover leap years to ensure accurate handling of February.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week before Christmas Eve for any given year, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve defining rules for date subtraction and leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

The challenge is to handle the progression of dates, including the transition between months and years if necessary. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year increments.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when adding days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of the palindrome day in 2020, where the date in MMDD format reads the same backward and forward. In the year 2020, there were two such dates: February 2, 2020 (02/02/2020), and December 2, 2020 (12/02/2020). Since today's date is mentioned to be the palindrome day, it refers to the latter, December 2, 2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify dates that are palindromes in the MMDD format. This involves checking if the month and day values are the same when reversed. In Prolog, this can be achieved by comparing the month and day digits and ensuring they are equal. Additionally, we need to consider the year 2020 as a constraint for this specific palindrome day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle comparisons between month and day digits.\n\n2. **Palindrome Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to check if a given date is a palindrome in the MMDD format. This rule should compare the month and day digits and confirm that they are equal.\n   - For example, for the date December 2, 2020 (date(12, 2, 2020)), the rule should check that 12 and 2 are the same when reversed.\n\n3. **Year Constraint:**\n   - Implement a constraint to ensure that the palindrome day occurs in the year 2020. This can be done by adding a condition to the palindrome day rule, checking that the year is 2020.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to find all possible dates that satisfy the palindrome condition within the year 2020. This involves generating dates with varying month and day combinations and checking if they meet the palindrome criteria.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s backtracking and pattern matching to efficiently find all dates that meet the palindrome criteria within the specified year.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for palindrome dates in 2020, such as February 2, 2020, and December 2, 2020, to ensure the rule correctly identifies them.\n   - Also, test non-palindrome dates to ensure they are correctly rejected by the rule.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that asks for the year and returns the palindrome day(s) for that year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can identify and return the palindrome day(s) for a given year, specifically finding the palindrome day in the year 2020. This involves defining rules for palindrome detection, handling date comparisons, and using Prolog's search capabilities to efficiently find the desired date(s).",

If so, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n   - For example, adding 7 days to November 25 should result in December 2, not November 32.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January of the next year when adding days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, crossing month boundaries, crossing year boundaries, and during leap years.\n\n9. **Calculate the Date One Week Later:**\n   - Given today's date, use the `add_days` function with 7 as the number of days to calculate the date one week from today.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week from a given date, taking into account month and year transitions, and handling special cases like leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, handling date boundaries, and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the palindrome day of 2020. The palindrome day of 2020 was February 2, 2020, which can be written as 02/02/2020 and reads the same backward and forward. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add one day to this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the given date by one day, considering the transition between months and years. In this case, adding one day to February 2, 2020, would result in February 3, 2020. The challenge is to handle the month and year transitions correctly, especially in the context of a leap year, as February has 29 days in a leap year. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, month transitions, and leap year handling.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering the transition between months. For example, if `MM` is 2 (February) and `DD` is 2, the next date should be February 3, 2020.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. For instance, if `MM` is 2 (February) and `DD` is 29, the next date should be March 1, 2020, considering February has 29 days in a leap year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Handle the transition from December to January when necessary, incrementing the year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions, both within and across leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later from the palindrome day of 2020, handling date increments, month transitions, and leap year considerations.

Since we don't have specific information about the month, we need to consider two possible scenarios:\n1. **Scenario 1:** If the last day of 1899 refers to December 31, 1899, then tomorrow would be January 1, 1900.\n2. **Scenario 2:** If the last day of 1899 refers to the last day of a month other than December (e.g., January, February, etc.), then we need to know the month to determine the exact date tomorrow.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle two possible cases: transitioning to the next month or transitioning to the next year. This involves understanding month lengths and year transitions. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle these transitions, taking into account the current date and month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day and month increments, as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Handle Last Day of the Month:**\n   - Write a rule to check if the given date is the last day of its month.

This handles regular day transitions within a month.\n\n4. **Transition to Next Month:**\n   - Write a rule to transition to the next month if the given date is the last day of the current month. This rule should reset the day to 1 and increment the month.\n\n5. **Transition to Next Year:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the given date is December 31.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that today is the last day of 1899. Since we are not provided with the specific month, we need to consider all 12 months and determine the last day of each. The last day of a month can vary, but it is typically the 30th or 31st, with February being an exception in non-leap years, ending on the 28th.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the last day of each month in 1899 and then determine the day before that date. This involves understanding the pattern of days in each month and handling the variation in month lengths. In Prolog, we can define rules for each month's last day and then implement logic to decrement that date by one day.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like decrementing days and months.\n\n2. **Last Day of Month Rules:**\n   - Write rules for each month to identify its last day in 1899. For example:\n     - `last_day_of_january(date(1, 31, 1899)).`\n     - `last_day_of_february(date(2, 28, 1899)).`\n     - ...\n\n3. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to decrement a day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should set the date to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the previous month when decrementing days. For example, decrementing one day from January 1 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Since 1899 is not a leap year, February should have 28 days. Ensure that the rules for February and other months reflect this.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for decrementing days and transitioning between months.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic for each month's last day in 1899 and verify that decrementing a day results in the expected date.\n   - Include test cases for transitioning between months, such as from January 1 to December 31, 1898.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date yesterday, given that today is the last day of 1899, by handling month transitions and considering the varying lengths of months.",

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from this date, considering any necessary adjustments for month length and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting one month from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months, especially when the starting date is not the first day of the month. In this case, subtracting one month from June 2, 1943, would take us back to May 2, 1943. We need to define rules in Prolog that handle this calculation, considering month lengths and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like subtracting months.\n\n2. **Subtract One Month Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If `MM` is not 1 (January), decrement it by 1. If `MM` is 1, decrement `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to 12 (December).\n\n3. **Handle Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day (`DD`) when subtracting a month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is June 2, 1944.

This date can be represented as 06/02/1943 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date.

In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this task effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from the given date.\n   - This function should decrement the year (`YYYY`) by 1 and consider month and day adjustments due to the varying number of days in different months.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the `subtract_year` function, include logic to adjust the month and day components of the date if necessary. For example, if the original date is February 29 in a leap year, the new date should be February 28 or February 29 in a non-leap year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year.

Given that today is one day after the originally scheduled concert date of June 1, 1943, the date 24 hours later would be June 3, 1943. This can be represented as 06/03/1943 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple increment of the day by one within the same month and year. There are no special conditions or transitions to consider for this specific date. In Prolog, we can handle this with a straightforward rule that increments the day, considering the number of days in the month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. In this case, if `MM` is 6 (June) and `DD` is 2, the next date should be June 3, 1943.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly handling the end of February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering potential month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month and year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that there are appointments scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the given date. This involves handling the transition from one day to the previous one, considering month and year boundaries.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting one day from a given date. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting for month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can define rules for decrementing days, handling month-end transitions, and managing year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day decrements and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Subtract One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If `DD` is not 1 (the first day of the month), decrement `DD` by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when `DD` is 1. For example, if the date is July 1, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the previous month (June 30 in this case).\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the previous year when `MM` is January and `DD` is 1. For instance, if the date is January 1, decrement `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` and `DD` to the last day of the previous year (December 31).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous one, considering month and year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the correct rule for day, month, or year decrements based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as subtracting a day from July 9, January 1, or February 28/29 during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date yesterday based on the given input, handling month and year transitions correctly and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current year, 1972, resulting in the year 1971.

In Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for year subtraction, handling month-end and year-end transitions, and checking for leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting years.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the current year is a leap year, the new year should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one year to another, considering the varying number of days in different months. If the target month has fewer days than the original month, adjust the day accordingly (e.g., moving from March 31 to February).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the subtraction of multiple years. This will be useful for cases where the user wants to calculate dates several years in the past.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for year subtraction, month and day adjustments, and leap year handling based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including transitions between months, years, and leap years. For example, test cases could include subtracting a year from February 29, 2020 (a leap year), or from December 31, moving from one year to the next.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date one year prior.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today's date, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from this date. This calculation will take us back to the previous week, which was the last week of June. Therefore, the date one week ago from July 9, 1972, would be June 28, 1972, represented as 06/28/1972 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a specific number of days (7 days) from a given date while handling month and year transitions. In this case, the calculation spans across the end of June, so we need to consider the transition from June to July when subtracting days. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including month-end and year-end adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - If subtracting days results in a negative day value, the function should adjust the month and year accordingly, considering month lengths and leap years.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `subtract_days` function to handle the transition from one month to the previous one. This involves decrementing the month and adjusting the day value based on the number of days in the previous month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursion within the `subtract_days` function to repeatedly subtract a single day until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct rules to apply when subtracting days, especially when dealing with month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including subtracting days across month boundaries (e.g., from July 1 to June 30), year boundaries (e.g., from December 31 to December 1 of the previous year), and leap years (e.g., February 29 to February 28 in a non-leap year).\n\n8. **Date Calculation for One Week Ago:**\n   - Given today's date, use the `subtract_days` function with `Days` set to 7 to calculate the date one week ago.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute a date one week prior to a given date, considering month and year transitions, and handling leap years.

In Prolog, we can define rules to handle this day increment, taking into account the month boundaries and year transitions, although in this specific case, we do not need to worry about those transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(day, month, year)` or `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. In this case, going from July 9 to July 10.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not applicable in this specific case, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the date exceeds the last day of December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years. However, this is not a concern for the given date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for the addition of multiple days if needed.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. In this case, the transition will be straightforward.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years. This will ensure that the code handles various scenarios accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours later from a given date, taking into account day increments and potential month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and handling date boundaries correctly.",

To find the date of yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the given date, considering any month or year transitions that may occur.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting one day from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years correctly. In this case, subtracting one day from May 4, 2004, would result in a date in the previous month, April. Prolog can be used to define rules for date subtraction, taking into account the varying number of days in each month and handling year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date subtraction operations.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to subtract one day from a given date.\n   - If `DD` is not the first day of `MM`, decrement `DD` by 1. Otherwise, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the new month, considering leap years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years correctly.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from the given date and time, which is 3:02 PM on May 4, 2004. This involves subtracting 10 days from the specified date while considering any month and year transitions that may occur during this interval.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate a date in the past by subtracting a certain number of days from a given date. This requires handling transitions between months and years, especially when the subtraction spans over these boundaries. In this case, going back 10 days from May 4 will take us to April. Prolog can be used to implement rules for date subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and adjusting for different month lengths.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for date and time, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(HH, MM, SS)`.\n   - Ensure that the date structure can handle operations like subtracting days.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - This function should handle transitions between months and years, adjusting the month and year values accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `subtract_days` function to check if the resulting day is less than 1. If so, decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n   - Special handling is needed for the transition from December to January, where the year should also be decremented.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to determine if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to subtract days one by one, decrementing the `Days` counter until it reaches 0. This will ensure accurate date subtraction, even when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct transition rules based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions, leap years, and different numbers of days to subtract. For example, subtracting 10 days from May 4, 2004, should result in April 24, 2004.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given the input date of May 4, 2004, use the `subtract_days` function with `Days` set to 10 to calculate the date 10 days ago.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date some days in the past from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as month and year boundaries and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the given time and date, which is 3:02 PM on May 4, 2004. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add one day to the current date, considering the time as well. Since we are adding 24 hours, we move to the next day, and the time will be 3:02 PM again. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is May 5, 2004, represented as 05/05/2004 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a specific duration of time (24 hours) to a given date and time. The challenge is to handle the transition from one day to the next, ensuring that the time remains consistent. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date and time manipulation functions to add durations to dates and handle the day and time components separately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for date and time, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(Hour, Minute, Second)`.\n   - Ensure these structures can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding durations.\n\n2. **Add 24 Hours Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_24_hours(Date, Time, NewDate, NewTime)` that adds 24 hours to the given date and time.\n   - This function should handle the transition to the next day correctly, considering the number of hours in a day and adjusting the date accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Within the `add_24_hours` function, include logic to check if adding 24 hours causes an overflow into the next day. If the resulting hour is less than the original hour, increment the day and reset the hour to the start of the day (e.g., 3:02 PM + 24 hours = 3:02 AM of the next day).\n\n4. **Date and Time Arithmetic:**\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's built-in date and time arithmetic functions to perform additions and comparisons. These functions will help in calculating the new date and time accurately.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for handling February correctly when adding durations that span over multiple months or years.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_24_hours` function with various input times to ensure that the function correctly handles the transition to the next day, regardless of the starting time.\n   - Include test cases that span across month and year boundaries to verify that the function adjusts the date and time correctly.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and time, and then displays the date and time 24 hours later, providing clear feedback on the calculation.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date and time 24 hours later from a given input, handling day and time transitions gracefully and considering potential leap years.",

For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 2, the next date should be March 3, 1966.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when the day is the last day of the current month. For March, if `DD` is 31, the next date should be April 1, 1966, with `MM` becoming 4 and `DD` resetting to 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January of the next year when necessary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not relevant for this specific date, consider adding a rule to check for leap years, which would impact the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, test the transition from March 30 to March 31, and from December 31 to January 1.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for the day after a given date, handling both regular day increments and month transitions. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is described as the second day of the third month of 1966. This means today's date is March 2, 1966, and the target date is one year before, which would be March 2, 1965. The date can be represented as 03/02/1965 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract one year from the given date while ensuring that the month and day remain consistent. In this case, since March exists in both years, we simply need to decrement the year by one. However, if the target date had been in a month that doesn't exist in the previous year (e.g., February 29), we would need to adjust the month and day accordingly. Prolog can be used to define rules for year subtraction and handling month and day adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the month and day are valid for the previous year, simply decrement the year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where the month and day need to be adjusted due to the year subtraction. For example, if the original date is January 31, the previous year's date should be January 31 as well, even though January 31 may not exist in the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly during leap years. If the original date is February 29, the previous year's date should be February 28 for non-leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to another, considering any necessary adjustments to the month and day.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including regular year transitions, transitions involving February 29 to February 28, and transitions across month boundaries (e.g., from March 1 to February 28).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute a date one year prior to a given date, handling regular and special cases like leap years and month boundaries.

If the year is a leap year and the date is in February, incrementing days may need to account for the extra day in February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for incrementing any number of days.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being incremented.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases for various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from March 30 to March 31, from December 30 to December 31, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling both simple day increments and more complex transitions involving the end of a month or year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date represented by \"9/7\" in the context of Jane watching NFL 2003. Given the format \"MM/DD,\" \"9/7\" translates to September 7. Therefore, the date today is September 7, 2003, or 09/07/2003 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves interpreting a date in the \"MM/DD\" format and converting it to the \"MM/DD/YYYY\" format by inferring the missing year. The year 2003 is mentioned in the context of Jane watching NFL, so it is safe to assume that the missing year is 2003. The challenge is to correctly associate the month and day with the inferred year. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for interpreting and converting dates.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle interpretation of dates in different formats.\n\n2. **Interpreting Input Date:**\n   - Write a rule that takes the input date in \"MM/DD\" format and interprets it as an instance of the `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure.\n   - For example, \"9/7\" should be interpreted as `date(9, 7, YYYY)`.\n\n3. **Inferred Year Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to infer the missing year from additional context. In this case, the context mentions \"NFL 2003,\" so the inferred year should be 2003.\n\n4. **Converting to Full Date:**\n   - Create a rule that takes the interpreted `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` structure with the missing year and fills in the inferred year.\n   - This rule should ensure that the final date structure has all components (MM, DD, and YYYY) filled in.\n\n5. **Handling Invalid Inputs:**\n   - Include error handling for cases where the input date is incomplete or in an invalid format.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various input dates in \"MM/DD\" format, ensuring that the inferred year is correctly applied and the resulting date is in the desired \"MM/DD/YYYY\" format.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date in \"MM/DD\" format and returns the interpreted date in \"MM/DD/YYYY\" format, taking into account the inferred year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can interpret and convert dates in different formats, handling missing components and providing a user-friendly interface for date manipulation.

If the day is greater than the number of days in that month, adjust the day and month accordingly.\n   - For instance, if we subtract 10 days from September 20, the result should be September 10, not September 30.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a given year is a leap year, which will impact the number of days in February during the subtraction process.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days. The rule should repeatedly subtract one day until the specified number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for date subtraction based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries.\n   - Test cases should also include leap years to ensure the correct handling of February during those years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date a specified number of days in the past, considering month and year transitions and handling special cases like leap years. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply those rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is September 7, 2003. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to the current date. This calculation should result in the date September 14, 2003, which can be represented as 09/14/2003 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a given current date. The challenge is to handle the progression of days, months, and years correctly, especially when crossing month boundaries. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to add days to a date, taking into account the varying number of days in each month and handling year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days to a date.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between months correctly, considering the varying number of days in each month.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check if adding days would exceed the number of days in the current month. If so, adjust the month and day accordingly, rolling over to the next month.\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle the transition between years when adding days. If adding days causes the month to exceed December, increment the year and set the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February during leap years when adding days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. For example, to add seven days, recursively call the `add_days` function seven times, adding one day at each step.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various dates and numbers of days to add, including transitions between months, years, and leap years. For example, test adding 7 days to September 7, 2003, to verify that it results in September 14, 2003.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date one week from a given date, handling month and year transitions and considering leap years.

Calculating the date 24 hours later involves adding one day to today's date. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be September 8, 2023, or 09/08/2023 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the day component of the current date by one while ensuring that we do not cross any month boundaries. In this case, incrementing one day from September 7 will simply result in September 8, without any month or year transitions. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, including day increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 9 (September) and `DD` is 7, the rule should calculate the next date as September 8, 2023.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not applicable in this specific case, include a general rule to handle transitions from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month.

This can be represented as 01/02/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one year to the next, considering that December has only 31 days. The key is to recognize the pattern that the day after December 31 is January 1 of the following year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that today cannot be December 32, 1929, because December has only 31 days. This implies that if today is not December 32, then yesterday must have been December 31, 1929. Therefore, the date yesterday was 12/31/1929 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to deduce the date of yesterday based on the invalid date of December 32, 1929. This involves understanding month boundaries and recognizing that December has only 31 days. In Prolog, we can use pattern matching and rules to determine the correct date for yesterday.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle month and day comparisons.\n\n2. **Invalid Date Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that identifies an invalid date like December 32, 1929. This rule should match the specific pattern of an invalid month and day combination.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that handles the transition from an invalid date to a valid date by rolling back to the last day of the previous month. In this case, it would adjust the date to December 31, 1929.\n\n4. **Normal Day Decrement Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that decrements the day by one if the date is not at the end of the month.\n\n5. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the same year.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for handling February correctly.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to identify invalid dates and apply the appropriate transition rules to determine yesterday's date.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover transitions between months, years, and leap years, ensuring that the program correctly identifies invalid dates and calculates the previous day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of yesterday based on an invalid date, handling month and year transitions and considering the number of days in each month.

In this case, subtracting 10 days from today's date (assuming today is January 1, 1930) will result in a date in December of the same year.

In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments and month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries.

In Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for date manipulation, including handling month-end transitions and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month-end transitions. If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM` unless it's December, in which case the year should increment.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a specific rule to handle the transition from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month. For example, from November 30 to December 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year, incrementing the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the correctness of the rules, including transitions between months (e.g., November to December), transitions between years (e.g., December to January), and leap years (e.g., February 28 to February 29).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of yesterday based on the input of the day before yesterday, handling month-end and year-end transitions correctly and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow based on the information that the day before yesterday was November 23, 1933. First, we need to calculate today's date, which is two days after November 23, 1933, and then we can determine the date for the following day. Given that November has 30 days, two days after November 23 would be November 25, 1933.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of the US Thanksgiving in the year 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. To find the date, we need to identify the fourth Thursday in November of the given year. This involves calculating the first Thursday in November and then adding three weeks to determine the fourth Thursday.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1. Calculate the first day of November in the given year (2001).\n2. Find the first Thursday in November by checking the days of the week for each day in the month.\n3. Add three weeks (21 days) to the first Thursday to arrive at the fourth Thursday, which is the date of Thanksgiving.\n4. Format the resulting date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nIn SWI-Prolog, we can use built-in predicates like `current_date` to get the current date and `check_date` to validate dates. We can also use arithmetic operations to perform date calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Calculate First Day of November:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the first day of November for a given year. This involves setting `MM` to 11 and `DD` to 1, while keeping the given `YYYY`.\n\n3. **Find First Thursday:**\n   - Implement a rule to find the first Thursday in November by checking the days of the week for each day starting from the first day of the month. Use Prolog's `check_date/3` predicate to check the day of the week.\n\n4. **Calculate Fourth Thursday:**\n   - Write a rule to add three weeks (21 days) to the first Thursday to find the fourth Thursday, which is Thanksgiving Day.\n\n5. **Format Date:**\n   - Implement a rule to format the resulting date in MM/DD/YYYY format for output.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years to ensure the Thanksgiving date is calculated correctly. For example, test for 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a year and returns the date of Thanksgiving for that year.\n\n8. **Error Handling:**\n   - Implement error handling for invalid inputs or years that are not supported by the current calendar.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date of US Thanksgiving for any given year, taking into account the specific rules for determining the fourth Thursday in November.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In the year 2001, the fourth Thursday of November was November 22, so yesterday would have been November 21, 2001. This date can be represented as 11/21/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of US Thanksgiving for the year 2001 and then determine the date one day prior to that. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday of November) and then performing a simple day subtraction. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Calculate Thanksgiving Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the first day of November, identifying the first Thursday, and then adding three weeks to reach the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Write a function to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day. If it is the first, decrement the month and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to another, especially when subtracting days near the end of a month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during date calculations.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases for various scenarios, including normal day subtractions, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, test subtracting one day from November 22, 2001, to ensure it yields November 21, 2001.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of yesterday based on the input of today's date being US Thanksgiving in 2001, handling month and year transitions correctly and considering the specific rules for calculating Thanksgiving.",

Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001. Therefore, to find the date 10 days ago, we need to calculate the date difference and then apply it to the given date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting 10 days from the given date. This involves understanding how to handle month and year transitions when subtracting days. In this case, since 10 days ago falls within the same month, we don't need to worry about transitioning to a different month or year. However, it's important to consider the number of days in each month to ensure accurate calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations like subtraction.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - If the resulting day is less than 1, adjust the day and decrement the month accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month if the day subtraction results in a negative day value.\n   - If the month becomes negative, decrement the year and set the month to the last month of that year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during date subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days, decrementing the day counter until it reaches zero.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow based on the given date of October 16, 1924. The prompt mentions a meeting rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, indicating that the reference date is one day prior to the desired date. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be October 17, 1924, which can be represented as 10/17/1924 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date. Specifically, we need to add one day to the given date to determine the date of the following day. This requires handling the transition between days, including the end of the month, and potentially the end of the year. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, month transitions, and year transitions to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that adds one day to a given date. If the day is not the last day of the month, simply increment the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day is the last day of the current month. For example, if the date is October 31, the next date should be November 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year. This will be important for cases where the date addition spans across years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Create a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for adding any number of days to a date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to October 16, 1924, which is the date of a rescheduled meeting. To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from this given date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting a month. This requires understanding the concept of month subtraction, including adjusting the year if the starting month is January. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid after subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day, adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the month subtraction, especially when crossing year boundaries. This will involve repeatedly applying the month subtraction rule until the correct number of months has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for month subtraction, taking into account the specific date structure and transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from January, February during leap and non-leap years, and other months with different day counts.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given the input date of 10/16/1924, use the month subtraction rule to calculate the date one month prior.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before a given date, handling transitions between months and years, and considering the impact of leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today's date is October 16, 1924. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to the current date. This calculation will result in a new date that is within the same month and year, so there are no month or year transitions to consider in this specific case.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the addition of seven days to the current date. This involves incrementing the day by seven while accounting for potential month and year transitions. In this instance, adding seven days falls within the same month, so we only need to consider day increments. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle this calculation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. In this case, adding seven days will not result in a transition to the next month.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific case, include rules to handle transitions to the next month and year if the day increment exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to add a specified number of days to a given date. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day increment rule until the desired number of days has been added.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, adding days that span across months, and adding days during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from a given date, handling day increments and potential month and year transitions.

The challenge is to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering the month, day, and year components of the date. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for dates and times, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(Hour, Minute, Second)`.\n   - Ensure that these structures can handle arithmetic operations for adding time intervals.\n\n2. **Add Time Interval Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_time_interval(Time, Interval, NewTime)` that adds a time interval (in seconds, minutes, or hours) to a given time.\n   - This function will handle wrapping around for hours (e.g., 24:00:00 + 1 hour = 00:00:00).\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function will handle month and year transitions, ensuring that the resulting date is correct even when crossing these boundaries.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when adding days.

This will enable calculations for dates across different years.\n\n5. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that asks for the description of the date, such as \"last day of January 2012.\" The program should then parse this input to extract the month and year.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with various inputs for different months, including months with different numbers of days (e.g., January, February in a leap year, March, etc.).\n   - Ensure that the program can handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing informative error messages.\n\n7. **Date Output:**\n   - Implement a predicate to display the calculated date in the desired MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date based on descriptions like \"last day of a month\" for a given year. This will involve pattern matching, user input handling, and date representation in SWI-Prolog.",

Since Jane is celebrating the last day of January, we know that today is January 31, 2012.

In Prolog, we can define rules to handle this month transition and correctly update the day and month values.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1. If the resulting day exceeds the number of days in the current month, the rule should handle the transition to the next month.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day increment exceeds the days in the current month. This rule should update the month (`MM`) and reset the day (`DD`) to the first day of the new month.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the current month is December and the day increment causes a transition to January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct transition rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as transitioning from January 31 to February 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 29 to March 1 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date tomorrow, given that Jane is celebrating the last day of January 2012.

To calculate the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the given date, considering any necessary adjustments for month and day values.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date, which involves decrementing the year and potentially adjusting the month and day values. In this case, subtracting one year from January 31, 2012, would result in a date in 2011.

In Prolog, we can define rules for year subtraction, month transitions, and day adjustments to handle this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting years.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from the given date.\n   - If `MM` and `DD` are not valid for the new year, adjust them accordingly. For example, if the date is January 31, 2012, subtracting one year would result in January 31, 2011, which is invalid since 2011 is not a leap year. The correct date would be January 30, 2011.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the `subtract_year` function, implement logic to check the number of days in each month and adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n   - For example, if the original date is March 31, the new date after subtracting a year should be February 28 (in a non-leap year) or February 29 (in a leap year).\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling the number of days in February during year subtraction.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month and day adjustments based on the current date and the year being subtracted.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including regular and leap years, different months, and dates that require adjustments (e.g., January 31, March 31, etc.).\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date one year prior.

For example, subtracting 10 days from August 25 should lead to August 15, but if we subtract another day, it becomes August 14, not July 25.\n   - Special cases for December and January should be considered, as well as leap years for February.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to handle the calculation of the date one week ago and the subtraction of 10 days. This will involve repeatedly applying the rules for day subtraction.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being subtracted.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those near month and year boundaries. For example, test subtracting 10 days from August 25, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n\n9. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date 10 days prior, providing clear instructions and handling invalid inputs.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 10 days before a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from September 1, 2021. To find this date, we need to subtract one month from September 1, considering any necessary adjustments for month length and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date one month prior to a given date, which can be achieved by subtracting one month from the original date. However, we need to consider the varying number of days in each month and handle the transition from one month to another, potentially crossing a year boundary. In this case, going one month back from September 1 would be August 1, 2021. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, handling these transitions and adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like subtracting months.\n\n2. **Subtract One Month:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, the year should be decremented, and the month should be set to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from September (9) should result in August (8).\n\n3. **Handling Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day component of the date when subtracting a month. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n   - For instance, if the original date is September 30, going one month back would result in August 30, which should be adjusted to August 31.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering the varying number of days in each month and potential year transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct month transition based on the current month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that it was September 1, 2021, a week ago. If it was September 1st a week ago, then today is September 8th, 2021. Therefore, the date one week from today would be September 15th, 2021, which can be represented as 09/15/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from today's date. This involves adding 7 days to the current date while handling any potential month or year transitions that may occur during this addition. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling month boundaries and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function will handle day increments, month transitions, and year transitions as necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check if adding the specified number of days would cause a transition to the next month. If so, adjust the month and day values accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a special case in the `add_days` function to handle the transition from December to January when adding days that span across the end of the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. For example, to add 7 days, recursively call the `add_days` function with 1 day added at a time.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct date transitions are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, adding days that cross into a new month, and adding days that span across the end of the year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute a date one week from today, considering all necessary date transitions and special cases, such as month and year boundaries.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, given that they married on January 2, 1958. To find today's date, we need to calculate the date that is exactly five years after their wedding date. This involves adding 5 years to the original date while handling potential leap years and ensuring that the resulting date is valid.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, adding 5 years to the original wedding date. This includes handling the transition between different months and years, considering the varying number of days in each month, and accounting for leap years. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date manipulation, including year increments, month transitions, and leap year adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding years and days.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), YearsToAdd, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - If `MM` and `DD` are not valid for the resulting year, adjust them to the last valid day of that month.

This will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the `add_years` function, include logic to check if the resulting month and day combination is valid for the new year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that Jane and John married on January 2, 1958, and today is their 5-year anniversary. This means that today's date is January 2, 1963, which is 5 years after their marriage. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be January 3, 1963, represented as 01/03/1963 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is one day after a given date, considering the passage of time and potential transitions between years. In this case, we are given the date of their marriage and the fact that today is their 5-year anniversary. By adding 5 years to the marriage date, we can determine today's date and then calculate tomorrow's date by simply adding one day. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding years and days.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition to a new year by incrementing the year and adjusting the day and month if necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `add_years` to check if the resulting year is a leap year and adjust the number of days in February accordingly.\n\n4. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle month and year transitions, similar to the `add_years` function.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and adjust the day and month accordingly. For example, adding one day to January 31 should result in February 1.\n\n6. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple years and days. For example, to add 5 years and 1 day, the function should recursively call `add_years` and then `add_days`.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of years and days to be added.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding years and days across month and year boundaries, handling leap years, and ensuring correct transitions between months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute tomorrow's date based on the given information, considering year transitions and potential leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, which is January 2, 1963. To find the date 10 days prior, we need to subtract 10 days from this anniversary date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days before a given date, specifically 10 days. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and years when subtracting days, as January is the first month of the year. In Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for decrementing days, months, and years, and handling these transitions correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from January 2 results in January 1.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day becomes zero, decrement the month. If the month becomes zero (December), decrement the year.\n   - Special handling is needed for months with different day counts, like February and leap years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, which is January 2, 1963. To find the date one month ago, we need to go back one month from this date, considering the transition from one month to another and the change in the year. Therefore, the date one month ago would be December 2, 1962, represented as 12/02/1962 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month prior to a given date, considering potential transitions between months and years. In this case, we are moving from January to December of the previous year. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date manipulation, including month and year adjustments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting a month.\n\n2. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Write rules to handle the transition from one month to another. If the current month is January, the previous month should be set to December of the previous year. For other months, simply decrement the month value.\n\n3. **Day Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when moving to the previous month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day, adjust the day to the last day of the new month.\n\n4. **Year Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous year when moving from January to December. This involves decrementing the year by 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years. If the original date is in February, the previous date may be in January of the same year if it is a leap year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering potential year transitions and day adjustments.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct rules to apply based on the current month and year.

Since it is their anniversary today, the date is January 2, 2023. One week from today would be January 9, 2023.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from the given date, January 2, 2023.

Implement this function using recursion, decrementing `Days` and repeatedly calling `add_day` to add a single day until `Days` reaches 0.\n\n3. **Add a Single Day:**\n   - Implement a function `add_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds a single day to a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions. If `DD` is not the last day of `MM`, increment `DD` by 1. Otherwise, increment `MM` by 1 and reset `DD` to 1, considering month lengths and leap years.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_day` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, which was on January 2, 1958. Given that their anniversary is today, the date 24 hours later would be the day after their anniversary, which is January 3, 1958. This can be represented as 01/03/1958 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date (their anniversary) by one day. This involves understanding the transition from one day to the next within the same month and year. In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for day increments, considering the number of days in each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` to add one day to the input date. If `DD` is not the last day of `MM`, simply increment `DD` by 1. If `DD` is the last day of the month, set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM` by 1, unless it is December, in which case increment `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to 1.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if `DD` is the last day of `MM` and, if so, apply the correct transition to the next month or year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the date is incremented correctly even across month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day increments and month-end transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as normal day increments, month-end transitions (e.g., from January 31 to February 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., from December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours after a given date, handling day increments and month transitions correctly.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday, given that Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, ate one egg per day, and ran out of eggs today. This problem involves calculating the number of days that have passed since May 9, 2017, and then subtracting one day to find the date of the day before Jane ran out of eggs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically calculating the number of days between two dates. We can then subtract one day to find the desired date. In Prolog, we can use built-in date manipulation functions and arithmetic operations to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Calculate Days Difference:**\n   - Write a function `days_difference(date(MM, DD, YYYY), date(MM2, DD2, YYYY2), Days)` that calculates the number of days between two dates. This can be done by subtracting the two dates as numbers (treating `YYYY` as 4 digits, `MM` as 2 digits, and `DD` as 2 digits) and then taking the absolute value.\n\n3. **Add and Subtract Days:**\n   - Implement functions `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` and `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to add and subtract days from a given date. These functions will handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if adding days causes the date to exceed the number of days in the current month, increment the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for adding and subtracting days based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `days_difference`, `add_days`, and `subtract_days` functions with various dates, including transitions between months and years, and during leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate Yesterday's Date:**\n   - Use the `days_difference` function to calculate the number of days between May 9, 2017, and today's date. Then, use the `subtract_days` function to find the date one day before today, which is the date yesterday.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date of the previous day based on a given date and the number of eggs eaten per day, taking into account date arithmetic and transitions between months and years.",

Given that she bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one per day, she would have run out of eggs 40 days later, which is June 18, 2017. Therefore, 10 days ago from today would be June 8, 2017. This date can be represented as 06/08/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date when Jane ran out of eggs based on the given information and then determine the date 10 days prior to that.

        "question": "On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from the day Jane ran out of eggs. Given that Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one per day, she would have run out of eggs 40 days later, which is June 18, 2017. The date one month before June 18, 2017, is May 18, 2017, and can be represented as 05/18/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is one month before a given date. This involves understanding how to subtract one month from a given date, considering the transition between months and handling cases where the month has fewer days than the target date. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic operations, including month subtraction.\n\n2. **Calculate Egg-Eating Duration:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the number of days it took for Jane to eat all 40 eggs. This will help in determining the date when she ran out of eggs.\n\n3. **Date Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day, adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering the possibility of crossing a year boundary.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for month subtraction across different scenarios, including normal cases, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. Verify that the day component is adjusted correctly in each case.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before a given date, considering various date transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be a useful tool for solving problems involving date arithmetic and manipulation.",

This problem involves calculating a date a certain number of days in the past, considering the transition from one year to another. Today's date is assumed to be the date when Jane ran out of eggs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 40 days before today's date (since Jane ate one egg per day for 40 days). This calculation should consider the transition from one month to another and also from one year to the next, as the calculation involves subtracting a significant number of days.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, ate one per day, and ran out of eggs today. This problem involves calculating the number of days that have passed since Jane bought the eggs, considering the daily consumption rate, and then adding that number of days to today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, taking into account a fixed rate of egg consumption (one egg per day). We can calculate the number of days between May 9, 2017, and today, and then add seven days to today's date to determine the date one week from now. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations and handle date boundaries, such as month transitions and leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days from dates.\n\n2. **Calculate Days Since Egg Purchase:**\n   - Write a function `days_since_purchase(PurchaseDate, Today, Days)` that calculates the number of days between the date Jane bought the eggs (`PurchaseDate`) and today's date (`Today`). This function should consider leap years and month lengths.\n\n3. **Add Days to Date:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date, handling month and year transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if adding days takes us past the end of a month, update the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `days_since_purchase` function with various purchase dates and today's dates to ensure accurate calculations.\n   - Test the `add_days` function with different starting dates and day counts to verify correct date transitions, including month and year changes.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one week from today, considering the egg consumption rate and handling date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and leap years.",

Given that Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one per day, she would have run out of eggs 40 days later, which is June 18, 2017. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be June 19, 2017, represented as 06/19/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 40 days after May 9, 2017, and then add another 24 hours to that date.

The last day of the first quarter will always be the last day of March, which is March 31st, unless it is a leap year, in which case it would be March 30th. In Prolog, we can use rules and date calculations to determine the date based on this information.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations related to quarters and months.\n\n2. **Identify Last Day of First Quarter:**\n   - Write a rule to identify the last day of the first quarter for a given year. This involves finding the last day of March, which is typically March 31, unless it is a leap year.\n\n3. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for accurately determining the last day of the first quarter in leap years.\n\n4. **Year Input:**\n   - Prompt the user to input the year for which they want to find the last day of the first quarter.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate the last day of the first quarter based on the input year. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in identifying the correct date based on the defined rules.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for both non-leap and leap years to ensure the logic correctly identifies the last day of the first quarter.\n\n7. **Displaying the Result:**\n   - After calculating the last day of the first quarter, display the result to the user in the format MM/DD/YYYY.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the last day of the first quarter for any given year, taking into account leap years. This involves understanding quarters, months, and date calculations, and utilizing Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The last day of the first quarter is the last day of March. Given that March has 31 days, the last day of March 2008 was March 31, 2008. Therefore, the date one month prior would be February 29, 2008, as 2008 is a leap year, and February had 29 days. This can be represented as 02/29/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month before the last day of March in 2008. This involves understanding the concept of quarters in a year and recognizing that the last day of the first quarter is the last day of March. We then need to handle the transition from March to February, taking into account the varying number of days in each month and the leap year adjustment. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Calculate Last Day of a Month:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the last day of a given month in a specified year. This involves checking if the year is a leap year and adjusting the last day of February accordingly.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date, considering the transition between months and adjusting the day and month accordingly.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day, adjust the day to the last day of the new month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a given year is a leap year, which will impact the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the last day of a month and the subsequent month subtraction. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in selecting the correct rules based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those that span month and year boundaries, to ensure that the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including leap years and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before the last day of the first quarter of a given year, taking into account month lengths, year transitions, and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter of a year includes the months of January, February, and March. Since March is the last month of the first quarter, and we are given that it is the last day of March, it implies that the date today is March 31, 2008. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be April 1, 2008, which can be represented as 04/01/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day, considering the transition from March to April. This involves understanding month-day boundaries and handling the change from one month to the next. In Prolog, we can define rules that manage day increments and month transitions, ensuring that the correct date is calculated.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should handle the transition to the next month. For example, if `MM` is 3 (March) and `DD` is 31, the next date should be April 1, 2008.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This rule should adjust the month and reset the day accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January of the next year if the date crosses the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check to determine if the year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later from the given input, handling both regular and special cases like month transitions.

We need to count forward by days from the start of the year until we reach a Monday. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to iterate through the days, checking each day's corresponding day of the week until we find a match.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle operations like adding days and checking the day of the week.\n\n2. **Days of the Week Enumeration:**\n   - Define an enumeration or structure to represent the days of the week, such as `enum_day(sunday, monday, tuesday, ...)` or `day(1, 2, 3, ...)` to associate each day with a unique identifier.\n\n3. **Day of the Week Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the day of the week for a given date. This can be done using a formula that considers the day, month, and year to determine the day of the week.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Counting:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to count forward by days from the start of the year until a Monday is reached. This rule should repeatedly add one day to the current date and check if it is a Monday.\n\n5. **Base Case:**\n   - The base case of the recursion should be when a Monday is found. At this point, the recursion should stop, and the current date should be returned as the solution.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find the correct date that satisfies the condition of being the first Monday of the year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years to ensure the correct date is calculated for the first Monday.

If today is the first Monday, then yesterday was the first Sunday of 2019, which is January 6, 2019. Therefore, the date yesterday can be represented as 01/06/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of the first Monday of 2019 and then determine the date one day prior to that.

        "question": "The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from the first Monday of 2019. Given that the first day of 2019 (January 1) was a Tuesday, the first Monday of 2019 would be January 7, 2019. To find the date 10 days prior to this, we need to subtract 10 days from January 7, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days before a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and potentially years when subtracting days. In this case, subtracting 10 days from January 7, 2019, will take us back to the previous month, December 2018. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days, months, and years, and handling transitions between them.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day, month, and year decrements.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month and year transitions. For example, subtracting one day from January 7, 2019, should result in January 6, 2019.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. If the day reaches the beginning of a month, decrement the month. If the month reaches January, decrement the year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to dynamically apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries.\n   - Test cases should also consider leap years and non-leap years to ensure accurate handling of February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for 10 Days Ago:**\n   - Given the date of the first Monday of 2019 (January 7, 2019), use the recursive subtraction rule to calculate the date 10 days prior to that date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 10 days before the first Monday of 2019, handling transitions between days, months, and years, and considering leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from the first Monday of 2019. If today is the first Monday of 2019, then it is January 7, 2019. One month prior to this date would be December 7, 2018, which can be represented as 12/07/2018 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month before a given date, considering the day of the week and the month transition. This involves understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting for the month transition, especially when moving backward from January to December. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Calculate First Monday of the Year:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of the first Monday of a given year. This involves finding the first day of the year, identifying if it is a Monday, and if not, finding the next Monday.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, it should transition to December of the previous year, and the day should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n4. **Handling Day Adjustments:**\n   - When subtracting a month, ensure that the day remains valid for the new month. For example, if the original date is January 31, the day should be adjusted to December 31 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the first Monday of the year and the subtraction of one month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is the first Monday of 2019. If today is the first Monday, then it is January 7, 2019, as January 1st falls on a Tuesday in 2019. One week from today would be January 14, 2019, which can be represented as 01/14/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) ahead of the given date. This involves understanding the days of the week and their progression. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to add days to a given date, considering the correct transition between days of the week.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations for adding days to a date.\n\n2. **Days of the Week Representation:**\n   - Define a mapping between days of the week and their corresponding abbreviations or full names (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function should handle the transition between days of the week correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Week Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition between weeks. For example, if adding 7 days lands on a Sunday, the correct date should be the following Monday.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add days to a date until the desired number of days (in this case, 7 days) has been reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for adding days based on the current day of the week and the target date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover different scenarios, including adding days that span across months and years, as well as handling leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one week from a given date, considering the correct progression of days and handling transitions between weeks, months, and years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",
