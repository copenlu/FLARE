                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. From this information, we can deduce that today is May 1, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

Therefore, the correct date today is January 1, 1930, represented as 01/01/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one year to the next, which occurs after December 31. The key is to recognize that the date rolls over to January 1 of the following year. This requires understanding both month-day boundaries and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to correctly identify when the transition to a new month and year should occur.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage both day and month increments as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should change the month to January (`MM` becomes 1), the day to 1, and increment the year (`YYYY` increases by 1).\n\n3. **Normal Case:**\n   - Write a rule that simply increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month and handles month transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between different months, recognizing that different months have different numbers of days (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days, etc.).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to determine if the year is a leap year to correctly handle February dates.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle day, month, and year transitions, making sure that the correct logic is applied depending on the date structure.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s built-in search to correctly apply rules and pattern matching, ensuring the correct date is selected when moving from one day to the next.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct transition from December 31 to January 1 across different years, including both non-leap and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately determines the date \"today\" based on the input, handling both regular and boundary cases like year transitions."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that the year 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future, which means it will be January 1, 2015, in 12 hours. Therefore, today is December 30, 2014. One week from today would be January 6, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the new year transition from December to January. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to December 30, 2014, should result in January 6, 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago, given that a concert originally scheduled for June 1, 1943, was delayed by one day, making today June 2, 1943. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

The solution involves structuring the provided date into a format that can be easily compared and matched with the expected output.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle comparisons and unification with input dates.\n\n2. **Input and Output Handling:**\n   - The input date, \"April 30, 2021,\" should be parsed and transformed into the `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` format.\n   - The expected output date is the same as the input date, as the query asks for the date of yesterday.\n\n3. **Date Comparison:**\n   - Write a rule that compares the input date with the expected output date.\n   - Use Prolog's pattern matching to unify the input date with the expected output date, confirming that they are the same.\n\n4. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date string (e.g., \"April 30, 2021\") and queries the system to verify if that date was indeed yesterday's date.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different months, days, and years to ensure that the program correctly handles various date formats and inputs.\n\n6. **Feedback to the User:**\n   - Provide clear feedback to the user, indicating whether the input date matches the expected date for yesterday.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple SWI-Prolog program that compares the input date with the expected date for yesterday, providing confirmation or denial based on the match. This program will focus on date parsing, pattern matching, and user interaction rather than complex date arithmetic or transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from a given date, which is April 30, 2021. To find the date 10 days prior, we need to subtract 10 days from April 30, 2021. This calculation will involve handling the transition between months, as well as considering the number of days in each month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date in the past by subtracting a specified number of days from a given date. The challenge lies in handling the transition between months, especially when crossing over from a longer month (30 or 31 days) to a shorter month (like April, with 30 days). Prolog can be used to define rules for date subtraction, handling month-end transitions, and correctly identifying the resulting date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for subtracting days.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day count.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from April 30 should result in April 29.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This involves recognizing when the day count goes below 1 and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - For instance, subtracting one more day from April 29 should result in March 31, as April only has 30 days.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive function to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This function should repeatedly call the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied for day and month transitions when subtracting days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including month-end transitions (e.g., subtracting days from April 30), year-end transitions (e.g., from December), and leap years (e.g., February in a leap year).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering month transitions and handling leap years.

First, we need to find today's date, which is one day after April 30, resulting in May 1, 2021. Then, we need to calculate the date one week prior to May 1, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past based on a known date in the future. We need to handle the subtraction of days, considering the transition between months and potentially years. In this case, the calculation will likely involve moving from May to April. Prolog can be used to define rules for date subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and managing different month lengths.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from May 1, 2021, should result in April 30, 2021.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes adjusting the month and day correctly, considering the number of days in each month.\n   - Special handling may be needed for February during leap years.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive function that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule. It should decrement a counter until it reaches zero, at which point the final date is obtained.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied for month-end and year-end transitions when subtracting days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including transitions between months (e.g., May to April), transitions between years (e.g., December to January), and leap years (e.g., February 2020 to February 2024).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date one week ago from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or leap years.

If so, adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly, considering different month lengths.\n\n4. **Year Transition:**\n   - Special handling is needed for December. If `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should be January 1 of the next year, so increment `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to 1 and `DD` to 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct transition rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `increment_day` function with various dates, including month-end transitions (e.g., April 30 to May 1), year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1), and leap year transitions (e.g., February 28 to February 29).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling month transitions and considering the impact of leap years. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and using SWI-Prolog's search capabilities to apply those rules effectively.",

The date can be represented as 05/30/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 2 days before a given date, which involves subtracting days from a specified deadline.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today's date, which is two days away from the deadline of June 1, 2021. First, we need to calculate today's date by subtracting two days from the deadline. Then, we can calculate the date one week ago from today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including subtracting days and handling month and year transitions. Since the deadline is in June, subtracting two days will likely bring us to a date in May. We then need to calculate the date one week prior to this date, which may involve further month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these date manipulations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date.\n   - Handle month and year transitions when subtracting days, especially when crossing the end of a month or year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to manage the transition from one month to another and from one year to another when subtracting days. For example, subtracting a day from May 1 should result in April 30, not May 0.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to repeatedly apply the `subtract_days` function to calculate the date two days before the deadline.\n\n6. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Use the `subtract_days` function to calculate today's date by subtracting two days from the deadline (June 1, 2021).\n\n7. **Determine Date One Week Ago:**\n   - Apply the `subtract_days` function again to calculate the date one week ago from today's calculated date.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules for month and year transitions during date subtraction.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_days` function with various dates, including month-end and year-end transitions, to ensure accurate results.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week ago from today's date, which is two days away from the given deadline.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today's date, given that the deadline is June 1, 2021, and it is currently two days away. This problem involves calculating a future date based on a known deadline and an interval of one week.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, adding one week (7 days) to today's date. This calculation should consider the transition between months and potentially between years if the addition spans a longer interval. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, handling month and year transitions, and performing arithmetic operations on dates.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic operations, including addition of days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle the transition between months and years when adding days. For example, adding one day to May 31 should result in June 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to check if adding a day would cause a transition to the next month. If the current day (`DD`) plus the added days exceeds the number of days in the current month, increment the month (`MM`) and reset the day to the corresponding day in the next month.\n\n4. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Also in the `add_days` function, handle the transition between years when adding days. If the current month is December and adding days causes a transition to January, increment the year (`YYYY`).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper function to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to determine the correct transition between months and years based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including transitions between months (e.g., May 31 to June 1), transitions between years (e.g., December 30 to January 1), and leap years (e.g., February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year and February 29 to March 1 in a leap year).\n\n8. **Calculate One Week Later:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to calculate the date one week (7 days) from today's date, which is two days away from the deadline of June 1, 2021.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week from today, considering month and year transitions and handling leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from a given deadline, which is June 1, 2021, and is specified as being two days away from the current date. This means that today's date is May 30, 2021. The date 24 hours later from today would be May 31, 2021. This date can be represented as 05/31/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 24 hours later from the given deadline, taking into account the specified time interval of two days. This involves understanding how to increment dates correctly, handling transitions between days, and considering month boundaries. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to perform these calculations and handle date manipulations effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days and performing date manipulations.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` that adds one day to the input date.\n   - This function should handle the transition from one day to the next, considering the number of days in each month.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Within the `increment_day` function, include logic to check if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, set the day to 1 and increment the month.\n   - For example, if the date is May 31, the next date should be June 1.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Add Hours Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_hours(Date, Hours, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of hours to the input date. This function will be useful for handling the 24-hour increment.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's recursive capabilities to define a function that adds 24 hours to the given deadline, considering the current date and applying the appropriate day and hour increments.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog's pattern matching and backtracking to select the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, leap years, and adding 24 hours to dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately calculate the date 24 hours later from the given deadline, considering the specified time interval and handling date manipulations and transitions effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date given that tomorrow's date is 11/12/2019. To find today's date, we need to subtract one day from the given date of tomorrow. This involves handling the transition from one day to another, potentially crossing month boundaries.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement logic for decrementing a date by one day, considering the number of days in each month and adjusting for month and year transitions. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including handling month-end and year-end cases.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, specifically decrementation.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day (`DD`) is not 1, simply decrement it. However, if `DD` is 1, then we need to consider the previous month.\n\n3. **Month Transition:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when `DD` is 1. If `MM` is not 1 (January), decrement it and adjust `DD` to the last day of the new month. For example, if the date is 11/01/2019, subtracting one day should result in 10/31/2019.\n\n4. **Year Transition:**\n   - Include a special case for handling the transition from January to December of the previous year when `MM` is 1 and `DD` is 1. In this case, decrement the year and set `MM` to 12, and `DD` to the last day of December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the appropriate rule for day subtraction based on the current date structure.

For example, for the date 11/12/2019, we should extract '11' as the month, '12' as the day, and '2019' as the year.\n\n3. **Increment Day:**\n   - Define a rule to increment the day component of the date by one. This will be the primary operation to calculate the date for tomorrow.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month if the day component exceeds the maximum number of days in the current month. For example, if the date is 05/31/2023, incrementing the day should result in 06/01/2023.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for incrementing the day, transitioning between months, and handling leap years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including regular day transitions, month-end transitions, and leap years.

To find the date yesterday, we need to calculate one day before tomorrow's date.

For example, if `MM` is 11 (November) and `DD` is 12, then the previous date should be November 11, 2019.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from the first day of the month to the last day of the previous month.

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from November 11, 2019, which involves handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting 10 days from a given date. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting for the transition from one month to another, and potentially from one year to another. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including decrementing days, handling month transitions, and considering leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic, including day decrementation.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day is the first of the month, decrement the month (`MM`) and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Year Transition:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the previous year when subtracting days from January.

To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract seven days from the given date. \n\n**Analysis:**\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date subtraction and handle potential month and year transitions. Given the date format, we can assume that the month and day values are within the valid range (1-12 for months and 1-31 for days). We will need to consider the scenario where subtracting seven days takes us back to the previous month. \n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day of the month is not the first, simply decrement the day value.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days.

This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle the transition between February 28 and 29 when subtracting days.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including ones that require transitions between months and years, such as dates near the end or beginning of a month or year.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date structure.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week ago from a given date, handling day subtraction and month/year transitions correctly.",

To calculate the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date, considering any necessary adjustments for month length and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting one month. This involves understanding the number of days in each month and making the appropriate adjustments to the month and year when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Handling Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment Logic:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day component when subtracting a month. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check to determine if a year is a leap year, which will impact the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date one month ago. This will involve repeatedly applying the month subtraction rule until the target date is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for month subtraction and day adjustments based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure that the month subtraction and day adjustments are accurate.\n   - Include test cases for both regular and leap years to verify the correctness of the solution.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month prior to a given date, handling transitions between months and years, and making the necessary day adjustments.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the given date, August 3, 1997. This can be calculated by simply adding one day to the given date, resulting in August 4, 1997. This date can be represented as 08/04/1997 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the day component of the given date by one while ensuring that we do not cross any month boundaries. In this case, incrementing August 3 by one day will not cross into a new month, so the solution is straightforward. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation and handle such calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. If the resulting day is greater than the maximum days in the current month, then set the day to 1 and increment the month.\n\n3. **Month Boundary Handling:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when incrementing the day. If the current month is December, then incrementing the month should set it to January of the following year.\n\n4. **Year Boundary Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December of one year to January of the next year when incrementing days. This will ensure that the year is correctly incremented in such cases.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not relevant for the given date, consider adding a rule to check for leap years, which will be important for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month and year boundaries. This will allow for the addition of any number of days to a given date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date. This will enable the program to handle various date increments, including those that cross month and year boundaries.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from September 9, 1909. To find this date, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date. This calculation will involve handling a transition to the previous month, as 10 days before September 9 is at the end of August.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires the subtraction of 10 days from a given date, taking into account month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can solve this by defining rules for date manipulation, including decrementing days and handling month-end and year-end transitions. The key is to ensure that the date is adjusted correctly when crossing month boundaries and that leap years are considered for accurate calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from September 9 should result in September 8.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day is the first of the month, decrement the month and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from September 1 should result in August 31.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January when subtracting days, decrementing the year and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Create a predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the current date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve month-end and year-end transitions, such as subtracting days from January 1 or December 31.\n   - Verify the program's accuracy for various numbers of days, including 1 day, 10 days, and dates that span across months or years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date 10 days prior to a given date, considering month and year transitions, and handling leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from September 9, 1909. To find this date, we need to subtract 7 days from September 9, 1909. This calculation will lead us to the previous week's date, which falls within the same month.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting a specific number of days (7 days) from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between days and months correctly, especially when crossing month boundaries. In this case, the calculation remains within the same month (September), so there is no need to consider year transitions. Prolog can be used to define rules for date subtraction and handling month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day count.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from September 9 should result in September 8.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition when subtracting a day from the first day of the month. This rule should decrement the month by one and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from September 1 should result in August 31.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not applicable in this specific case, include a rule to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days. This will involve repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (7 days) has been subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases for various scenarios, including normal day subtractions, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions. For example, subtracting 7 days from September 9, 1909, should result in September 2, 1909.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date one week ago from a given date, handling month transitions and considering the structure of days and months in the calendar.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that today is April 19, 1969. To find the date of tomorrow, we simply need to add one day to today's date. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be April 20, 1969, which can be represented as 04/20/1969 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a basic date addition operation by incrementing the day while keeping the month and year constant. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to handle date manipulation, ensuring that we correctly update the day without affecting the month or year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Month, Day, Year)` to represent dates. For example, today's date would be `date(4, 19, 1969)`.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments within the same month and year.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Create a rule named `increment_day` that takes a date as input and returns the date for the next day.\n   - In this rule, we will add 1 to the `Day` component of the date structure, keeping the `Month` and `Year` components unchanged.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not necessary for this specific case, include logic to handle transitions to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n   - Similarly, handle transitions to the next year if the incremented month exceeds the number of months in a year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a predicate to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during date additions.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases to validate the `increment_day` rule, including scenarios where the day increment crosses into a new month or year.\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly query that allows the user to input a date and receive the date for the following day.\n\n7. **Prolog Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's pattern matching and unification to apply the `increment_day` rule based on the input date structure.\n\n8. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Consider implementing a recursive predicate to handle more complex date additions, such as adding a variable number of days to a given date.\n\nBy following this plan, we can guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately determine the date for tomorrow, handling day increments and potential month and year transitions.

To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to the current date. However, since there are only 30 days in April, adding seven days will take us to the end of the month, which is April 30. To find the date one week from April 30, 1969, we need to consider the month and year transition. The correct date one week from today is May 6, 1969, which can be represented as 05/06/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date addition and handling the transition between months. We need to calculate the date after adding seven days to the current date, taking into account the varying number of days in each month. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle date arithmetic and month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day and month arithmetic.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function will handle day increments within the same month and month/year transitions correctly.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if adding days would exceed the number of days in the current month. If so, adjust the day and month accordingly (e.g., from April 30 to May 1).\n\n4. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between years when adding days. For example, adding days to December 31 should roll over to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a function to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to add multiple days to a date. For example, to add seven days, recursively call `add_days` with 1 day seven times.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries, taking leap years into account.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from a given date, handling month and year transitions correctly and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

This involves a simple increment of one day, leading to the date April 20, 1969. The date 24 hours later can be represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the addition of one day to the given date while considering potential month and year transitions. In this specific case, since April has 30 days, adding one day will not cause a transition to the next month. Therefore, the solution involves incrementing the day value by one.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For instance, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not applicable in this case, include a general rule to handle transitions to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a rule to handle transitions to the next year if the incremented month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February in leap years, though it does not apply in this specific case.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle day increments, month transitions, and year transitions.

Since today is her 16th birthday, it must be a leap year again, which means today's date is February 29, 2016. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be March 1, 2016, represented as 03/01/2016 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate Jane's birthday in 2016, taking into account that she was born on February 29 in a leap year. This involves understanding leap year patterns and calculating dates accordingly. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to determine Jane's birthday and then add one day to find the date tomorrow.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic and leap year considerations.\n\n2. **Leap Year Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. A leap year occurs every four years, except for years divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400.\n\n3. **Calculate Jane's Birthday:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate Jane's birthday in a given year. Since she was born on February 29, the rule should set `MM` to 2, `DD` to 29, and consider the leap year rule to determine the correct year.\n\n4. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Define a rule to increment the day by one, considering month and year transitions. This rule will be used to calculate the date tomorrow.\n\n5. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when incrementing days. For example, if the month is December and the day is 31, the next date should be January 1 of the following year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate the date tomorrow by applying the increment day rule to Jane's birthday date.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date structure and whether it is a leap year.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct calculation of Jane's birthday in different years, including leap years and non-leap years.\n   - Test cases should also cover the correct transition to March 1 when incrementing from February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine Jane's birthday in a given year, considering leap years, and then calculate the date tomorrow. This involves handling date arithmetic, leap year patterns, and month and year transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthdate is February 29, 2000, which is a leap day. Leap years occur approximately every four years, adding an extra day to the month of February. The year 2000 was a leap year, making February 29 a valid birthdate. Given that today is her 16th birthday, it is now February 29, 2016. The task is to determine the date yesterday, which would be February 28, 2016.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of leap years and handle the calculation of a birthday falling on a leap day. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for calculating birthdays, handling leap years, and performing date arithmetic to determine the date yesterday.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic and comparisons.\n\n2. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. A leap year occurs almost every four years, except for years divisible by 100 but not 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not, and 2024 will be a leap year.\n\n3. **Birthday Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate a birthday based on a given birthdate and the number of years since birth. This rule should consider leap years and adjust the date accordingly.\n\n4. **Date Arithmetic:**\n   - Implement rules for basic date arithmetic, such as adding or subtracting days, months, or years from a given date.\n\n5. **Handling Yesterday's Date:**\n   - Create a rule to calculate yesterday's date based on a given date. This rule should subtract one day from the input date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle date arithmetic, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for date calculations based on the input conditions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for birthday calculations on both regular and leap years, ensuring that the leap day (February 29) is handled correctly.\n   - Verify that the \"yesterday\" calculation works accurately for various dates, including month and year transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can calculate yesterday's date based on Jane's birthdate, taking into account the concept of leap years and her 16th birthday celebration.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, which means she was born on February 29, 2000, during a leap year. Given that today is her 16th birthday, it is now February 29, 2016. The task is to determine the date 10 days ago from this date. Calculating 10 days ago involves subtracting 10 days from February 29, 2016, which may require handling a month transition.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another when subtracting days. Since February only has 28 days in common years and 29 days in leap years, subtracting 10 days from February 29 will take us back to February 19, which is within the same month. However, we must also consider the transition to the previous year, as February 19, 2016, is before Jane's birthday in 2016.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day and year subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering the transition between months. If the day becomes zero, the month should be decremented, and the day should be set to the last day of that month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the previous month and year when subtracting days. For example, subtracting 10 days from February 29, 2016, should result in February 19, 2016, which is within the same month but the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Create a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during the subtraction process.\n\n5. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the subtraction of multiple days. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to ensure that the correct transition rules are applied based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and during leap years.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input Jane's birth date and the number of days to subtract, providing clear instructions and handling potential errors gracefully.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date a certain number of days ago from a given date, considering month and year transitions, as well as leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, and today she is celebrating her 16th birthday, which means she was born in the year 2000. To find the date one year ago from today, we need to calculate the date when Jane was 15 years old. This involves subtracting one year from her birth date while considering the varying number of days in February across different years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting one year from a date that falls on the last day of February, which has a different number of days depending on whether it is a leap year. In this case, we need to determine if the year of Jane's 15th birthday was a leap year to correctly identify the last day of February for that year. Prolog can be used to handle this calculation by defining rules for year subtraction, month-end transitions, and leap year checks.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle subtractions in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from the given date. If the year is a leap year, ensure that the last day of February is adjusted to February 29.\n\n3. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given year is a leap year. A leap year occurs every four years, except for century years not divisible by 400. This rule will be crucial for determining the last day of February.\n\n4. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the last day of the previous month when subtracting a year. For example, if Jane's birthday is February 29 during a leap year, the previous year's birthday would be February 28.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the transition from one year to another, considering month-end and leap year transitions. This rule should repeatedly subtract one year until the target date is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for year subtraction, month-end transitions, and leap year checks based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that fall on the last day of February in both leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of one year, ensuring that the date is adjusted properly for leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year ago from Jane's birthday, considering the dynamic nature of the last day of February in leap years.

        "question": "Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 16th birthday falls on February 29, 2016, which is a leap day. Since leap years occur roughly every four years, adding 16 years to 2000 would typically bring us to 2016, a leap year with 29 days in February. The date 24 hours later would be March 1, 2016, as it is the day immediately following February 29.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date 24 hours later from a leap day (February 29) in a leap year (2016). This involves understanding how to handle the transition from February 29 to March 1, considering the varying number of days in February during leap years. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules to manage this transition and calculate the date 24 hours later.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Leap Year and Leap Day Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, unless it is also divisible by 100 but not by 400.\n   - Include a special case for handling the transition from February 29 to March 1 in a leap year. This transition only occurs once every four years (except for century years not divisible by 400).\n\n3. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering the month-end transition. If `DD` is the last day of the month, increment `MM` to the next month and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years, ensuring that the date rolls over correctly, especially in the case of February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions, as well as the leap day transition.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected, especially when dealing with leap days and month-end transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions, transitions involving the end of a month, and specifically, the transition from February 29 to March 1 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 24 hours later from a leap day in a leap year, considering the unique aspects of leap years and the varying length of February.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, and she is turning 16 this year, 2017. To find her birthday in 2017, we need to consider that February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year. Since 2001 was a common year, February had 28 days. Therefore, Jane's birthday in 2017 would be February 28, which is 16 years after her birth year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe task is to calculate Jane's birthday date in 2017, given that she was born on the last day of February in 2001.

If her birth year is a leap year, her birthday falls on February 29, and in a common year, it falls on February 28.\n\n4. **Add Years Rule:**\n   - Create a recursive rule to add years to a date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's birthday is on the last day of February, which means she was born on February 28, 2001, as 2001 is not a leap year. Given that today is her 16th birthday, it is February 28, 2017. The task is to determine the date 10 days ago from this birthday. Calculating 10 days ago involves subtracting 10 days from February 28, 2017, which may require handling a transition between months.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days from a date, considering potential transitions between months and years. In this case, subtracting 10 days from February 28 falls within the same month, but it is important to account for such transitions in the code. Prolog can be used to define rules for day subtraction and month-end transitions, ensuring accurate date calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day subtraction and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering month-end transitions. If `DD` is 1, then subtracting one day should result in the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This rule should consider the number of days in each month and adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January of the next year when subtracting days.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve month-end and year-end transitions, as well as leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from Jane's 16th birthday, which is today. Given that Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, her 16th birthday falls on February 28, 2017. To find the date one week ago from this birthday, we need to subtract seven days from February 28, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of seven days from a given date, taking into account the transition between months and years. February has 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year. Since 2017 is not a leap year, we need to subtract seven days from February 28, considering the transition to the previous month, which is January. This will involve decrementing the month and adjusting the day accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including day and month decrements.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is celebrated 50 years after their marriage on January 2, 1958. To find the date of their golden anniversary, we need to calculate 50 years from the given marriage date. This involves adding 50 years to the year 1958 and considering the corresponding date in January.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date a certain number of years (50 years) after a given date. We need to add 50 years to 1958, resulting in the year 2008. Then, we need to determine the corresponding date in January, which is simply January 2, mirroring the original marriage date. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations and transformations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years.\n\n2. **Adding Years to a Date:**\n   - Write a rule to add a certain number of years to a given date. This involves incrementing the year by the specified amount and handling any month and day adjustments due to leap years or month length differences.\n\n3. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a function to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately adjusting the number of days in February when adding years.\n\n4. **Month and Day Preservation:**\n   - Ensure that the month and day values remain consistent when adding years. If the resulting year is a leap year and the original date falls in February, adjust the day to the corresponding date in the leap year.\n\n5. **User Input and Calculation:**\n   - Prompt the user to input the original marriage date (e.g., date(1, 2, 1958)).\n   - Calculate the date 50 years later by adding 50 years to the input year and preserving the month and day values.\n\n6. **Displaying the Result:**\n   - Use Prolog's formatting functions to display the resulting date in the desired MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover different scenarios, such as adding years to dates in February during leap and non-leap years, and adding years that cross century boundaries.\n\n8. **Handling Invalid Inputs:**\n   - Implement error handling for invalid user inputs, such as non-existent dates or dates with incorrect month or day values.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that calculates the date of Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, 50 years after their marriage in 1958.

        "question": "Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. Today is their golden wedding anniversary. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is their 50th wedding anniversary. Given that they married on January 2, 1958, their golden anniversary occurs in the year 2008. To find the date 10 days before this anniversary, we need to calculate the date of the anniversary and then subtract 10 days.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating the date of the golden wedding anniversary and then subtracting 10 days from that date. The calculation of the anniversary date requires adding 50 years to the original wedding date, considering potential leap years and handling transitions between months and years. Once the anniversary date is determined, we need to subtract 10 days, which may involve crossing month boundaries and adjusting for the number of days in each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Calculate Golden Wedding Anniversary:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of the golden wedding anniversary by adding 50 years to the original wedding date.\n   - Handle potential leap years by checking if the resulting year is a leap year and adjusting February accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between years when adding 50 years. This involves incrementing the year and checking if the resulting year is a leap year.\n\n4. **Subtract 10 Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract 10 days from a given date, considering month boundaries. If the day goes below 1, decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n5. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day is greater than the number of days in the month, decrement the month and set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during date calculations.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of 10 days, as well as the calculation of the golden wedding anniversary date.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for date calculations, month and year transitions, and leap year adjustments.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various original wedding dates to ensure the golden anniversary date is calculated correctly for different years, including leap years and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of 10 days from different dates, crossing month boundaries, and adjusting for leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate the date 10 days before Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, taking into account the anniversary date calculation, date subtraction, and handling of various date transitions and special cases.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is being celebrated today. Given that they married on January 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage, which means today's date is January 2, 2008. To find the date one month ago from today, we need to calculate the date for December 2, 2007, and represent it in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one month from a given date. This involves understanding the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another. In this case, subtracting one month from January will result in a date in the previous month, December. We need to consider the number of days in each month and adjust the month and year accordingly. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, the resulting month should be December of the previous year.\n   - For example, subtracting one month from January 2, 2008, should result in December 2, 2007.\n\n3. **Day Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day (e.g., transitioning from March 31), adjust the day to the last day of the resulting month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering potential year transitions.\n   - For example, to subtract one month from January 2, recursively apply the rule to get to December, and then adjust the year if necessary.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for month subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from different starting months, handling transitions between years, and considering leap years.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given the anniversary date of January 2, 2008, use the month subtraction rule to calculate the date one month ago, which should result in December 2, 2007.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can determine the date one month prior to a given date, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years.

        "question": "Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. Today is their golden wedding anniversary. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is being celebrated today. Given that their wedding date was January 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary marks 50 years of marriage. To find the date one year ago from today's anniversary, we need to calculate the date that was 49 years ago from their wedding date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past based on a known anniversary date and a specific interval (49 years). We need to handle the subtraction of years from a given date, considering potential transitions between months and years. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the resulting year is not a leap year and the date is February 29, adjust the date to February 28 of the previous year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and days when subtracting years. For example, if the resulting month has fewer days than the original date, adjust the day accordingly (e.g., moving from March 31 to February).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, ensuring correct handling of February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple years. This will involve repeatedly applying the single-year subtraction rule until the desired number of years (49 years) has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to select the appropriate transition logic based on the current date and the number of years being subtracted.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal year subtractions, transitions between months, and handling leap years correctly.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given the wedding date of January 2, 1958, use the recursive function to subtract 49 years and determine the date of their golden wedding anniversary.\n   - Then, use the year subtraction rule to find the date one year ago from their anniversary.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year before Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, considering all necessary date transitions and adjustments for leap years. This will involve defining rules for year subtraction and leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is 50 years after their marriage on January 2, 1958. To find the date one week ago, we need to calculate their golden wedding anniversary date and then subtract seven days from it. This involves handling the addition of 50 years and then subtracting a week from that date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem consists of two parts: calculating the golden wedding anniversary date and then subtracting seven days from that date. The first part involves adding 50 years to the original marriage date, which is a straightforward date addition operation. The second part requires handling the subtraction of days, potentially crossing month boundaries, and possibly year boundaries as well. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations and handle the necessary transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Golden Wedding Anniversary Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the golden wedding anniversary date by adding 50 years to the original marriage date. This involves incrementing the year by 50 and handling any necessary adjustments to the month and day due to leap years or varying number of days in months.\n\n3. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date, considering the transition between months and years. If the day is the first of the month, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, potentially in the previous year.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to another when subtracting days. If the day subtraction reaches the start of a month, decrement the month and adjust the day accordingly. If it reaches the start of a year, decrement the year and adjust the month and day.\n\n5. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (seven days in this case) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurate day subtraction in February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to dynamically apply the correct rules for day subtraction based on the current date structure, month, and year boundaries.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those that cross month and year boundaries, to ensure accurate results. Test both leap and non-leap years as well.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week ago from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, taking into account the addition of 50 years and the subsequent subtraction of seven days, while handling all necessary date transitions and adjustments.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from Jane and John's golden wedding anniversary, which is 50 years after their marriage on January 2, 1958. To calculate the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to their anniversary date, considering any month or year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, adding one day to the given date while handling month and year transitions. Since their anniversary is on January 2, adding one day will not cross into a new month or year. However, we should consider the possibility of crossing such boundaries in the general case. In Prolog, we can define rules for date addition and month/year transitions to handle this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Create a rule that adds one day to the given date. If the day is not the last day of the month, simply increment the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the current day is the last day of the current month.

        "question": "Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane's 3-year work anniversary, given that she started working in 2016 and remembers spilling coffee on her laptop on December 2, which was her second day at work. To find today's date, we need to calculate three years from Jane's first day at work, which was December 1, 2016. Therefore, today's date is December 1, 2019, and it can be represented as 12/01/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate a date that is three years after a given start date. This involves adding 36 months to the original date, considering the transitions between months and years. In this case, the calculation spans over the end of February in leap years and the transition from one year to the next. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling month lengths and leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding months and years.\n\n2. **Add Months Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_months(Date, Months, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of months to a given date. This function should handle the transition between months, considering the varying number of days in each month.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_months` function to check if the resulting day is valid for the target month. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the target month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a helper function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle transitions between years within the `add_months` function. If the addition of months results in a month greater than 12, increment the year accordingly and adjust the month and day values.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple months, especially when crossing year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct transition rules based on the current date and the number of months being added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_months` function with various scenarios, including transitions between months, year boundaries, and leap years. For example, adding 36 months to December 1, 2016, should result in December 1, 2019.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date three years after a given start date, considering month and year transitions, as well as leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, handling special cases, and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane started her job in 2016, and today is her 3-year work anniversary, which means it has been exactly three years since she started working.

If the resulting year is a leap year and the date falls in February, adjust the date to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n3. **Month and Day Handling:**\n   - Define rules to handle the transition between months when adding years. For example, adding one year to January 31, 2020, should result in February 28, 2021 (or February 29 in a leap year).\n\n4. **Date Addition Rule:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to add three years to the initial date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's work anniversary is on December 1, and she recalls spilling coffee on her laptop on December 2, which was her second day at work. To find the date 10 days ago from an unknown date, we need to calculate the date difference and then subtract it from the known date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 10 days before Jane's second day at work, which was December 2. This involves subtracting 10 days from a date in early December, potentially crossing into November. We need to handle the transition between these two months and correctly adjust the day and month values. In Prolog, we can define rules for date subtraction and month-end transitions to solve this problem.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date arithmetic, including subtraction.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the last day of the month, simply decrement the day value.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day is 1, decrement the month value and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, 10 days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for accurately handling the number of days in February during date subtraction.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to determine the correct path for date subtraction, especially when crossing month boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the subtraction logic with dates that span month boundaries, such as subtracting days from early December to late November.\n   - Include test cases for leap years to ensure that the number of days in February is handled correctly during date subtraction.\n\n8. **Date Calculation:**\n   - Given that Jane's second day at work was December 2, use the recursive subtraction rule to calculate the date 10 days prior to that.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 10 days before a given date, handling month transitions and considering leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's work anniversary is today, which is three years after she started her job in 2016. She recalls an incident with her laptop and coffee on her second day, December 2. Given that her work anniversary is in December, it can be deduced that today's date is December 2nd of a year that is three years after 2016, which is 2019. The task is to calculate the date one month ago from today's date, December 2, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo determine the date one month ago, we need to subtract a month from the current date, December 2, 2019. This involves handling the transition between months, considering the number of days in each month, and potentially adjusting for the previous year. In this case, subtracting a month from December would lead us to November. The specific date needs to be calculated while accounting for the varying number of days in each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can accommodate operations for subtracting months and days.\n\n2. **Handling Month Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, the subtraction should result in the previous month, December, of the same year.\n   - For all other months, the rule should decrement the month value by 1 and adjust the day and year as needed.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment:**\n   - Within the month subtraction rule, include logic to adjust the day value based on the number of days in the previous month. If the resulting day is higher than the number of days in the new month, set the day to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Year Transition:**\n   - Handle the transition to the previous year when subtracting a month results in a month that is in the previous year. This will be necessary for months like January, where subtracting a month leads to December of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to accurately handle the number of days in February during the day adjustment step.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to handle the transition from one month to another, especially when crossing year boundaries. This will ensure that multiple month subtractions can be handled correctly.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the current month and apply the appropriate rules for month subtraction, day adjustment, and year transition.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including month-end dates, dates that span year boundaries, and leap years. For example, subtracting one month from January 31 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating the date one month ago from a given date, considering month transitions, day adjustments, and year changes.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's work anniversary is on December 1st, and she recalls spilling coffee on her laptop the following day, December 2nd. To find the date one week ago from today, we need to calculate seven days back from the date of the coffee incident.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves calculating a date one week ago from a given date, considering potential month and year transitions. In this case, we need to subtract seven days from December 2, which falls within the same month. However, we must still account for the possibility of crossing month and year boundaries. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, handling day decrements, and managing transitions between months and years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from the given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day value.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition from the first day of the month to the last day of the previous month. For example, subtracting one day from December 1 should result in November 30.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to manage the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction crosses into the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement logic to check for leap years, which is necessary for accurately handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract seven days by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for day and month transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that span across month and year boundaries, including leap and non-leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's work anniversary is on December 1st, 2019, which is three years after she started her job in 2016. She recalls that on her second day, December 2nd, she had a mishap with coffee and her laptop. The task is to determine the date 24 hours after this incident. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the date 24 hours later would be the same as the date one day later, which is December 3rd, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the given date, December 2nd, 2019, by one day. This involves handling the transition from one day to the next, considering the number of days in the month and adjusting for month and year changes if necessary. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules to manage these date transitions and accurately calculate the date 24 hours later.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Handling Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if the input date is December 2nd, the day should be incremented to December 3rd.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. If `DD` is the maximum number of days in the given `MM`, then incrementing the day should result in rolling over to the next month, and `DD` should be set to 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year. If `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, then incrementing the day should lead to January 1 of the following year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years. If the year is a leap year and the date falls within February, adjust the maximum number of days accordingly.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic for Day Increment:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that any number of days can be added, and the correct transitions will be applied.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to automatically select the appropriate rule for day and month transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date by calculating the number of days that have passed since Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, which is given as 176 days. To find today's date, we need to add 176 days to March 20, 2020, and determine the resulting date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date arithmetic, specifically adding a significant number of days to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transitions between months and years as we add days, potentially crossing over month and year boundaries. In SWI-Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to handle these transitions and calculate the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day, month, and year arithmetic.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a recursive function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - In the base case, if `Days` is 0, `NewDate` should be the same as `Date`.\n   - In the recursive case, use the `increment_day` function to add a single day and then recursively call `add_days` with `Days` decremented by 1.\n\n3. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that correctly handles the transition to the next day, considering month and year boundaries.\n   - If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment `DD` by 1.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM` by 1, handling month transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle transitions between months, considering the number of days in each month.\n   - Special handling is needed for February during leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various numbers of days to add, including cases that cross month and year boundaries, such as adding 176 days to March 20, 2020.\n   - Verify that the function correctly handles leap years and non-leap years, ensuring accurate transitions through February.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate today's date by adding a given number of days to a specified date, handling all necessary transitions and special cases.",

        "question": "Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and 176 days have passed since then. To find the date one year ago, we need to calculate the date that was one year before today's date and then subtract 176 days from that date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two main steps: calculating one year before a given date and then subtracting a number of days from that date. The challenge lies in handling the transition between different months and years when performing these calculations. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and logic to address these challenges.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Year, Month, Day)` to represent dates, where `Year`, `Month`, and `Day` are integers.\n\n2. **Calculate One Year Ago:**\n   - Implement a predicate `one_year_ago(Date, Result)` that calculates the date one year before the given date. This involves decrementing the year by 1 and handling the transition between months correctly.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - When decrementing the year, consider the number of days in each month and adjust the month and day values accordingly. For example, if today is March 20, decrementing the year by one would result in a date in March of the previous year.\n\n4. **Subtract Days:**\n   - Implement a predicate `subtract_days(Date, Days, Result)` that subtracts a specified number of days from a given date. This predicate should handle cases where the subtraction results in a negative day value, indicating a transition to the previous month.\n\n5. **Handle Negative Day Values:**\n   - When subtracting days results in a negative day value, adjust the day and month accordingly. For example, if today is March 20 and we subtract 15 days, the result would be March 5. However, if we subtract 35 days, the result should be February 24, considering February has fewer days.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years when handling the month of February during date calculations. This will ensure accurate results for leap years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `one_year_ago` and `subtract_days` predicates with various input dates to ensure they handle month and year transitions correctly. For example, test dates near the end and beginning of the year, such as December 31 and January 1.\n\n8. **Calculate Target Date:**\n   - First, calculate one year ago from today's date using the `one_year_ago` predicate. Then, subtract 176 days from that date using the `subtract_days` predicate to find the target date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can determine the date one year ago from today, considering the given information about Jane's job quitting date and the number of days passed.",

Let's break this down:\n\n- Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, which can be represented as 03/20/2020 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n- We are asked to calculate the date 176 days after this date.\n- Then, we need to find the date one week (7 days) ago from that calculated date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two parts: date addition and date subtraction. For the first part, we need to add 176 days to the given date, considering any month and year transitions that may occur. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and correctly adjusting the month and year as needed.\n\nFor the second part, we need to subtract 7 days from the calculated date, again considering month and year transitions. This subtraction should be handled similarly to the addition, but in reverse.\n\nIn SWI-Prolog, we can use rules, recursion, and pattern matching to handle these date calculations effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle additions and subtractions of days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Date Addition Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` to add a specified number of days to a given date, considering month and year transitions.\n   - This function should handle cases where adding days crosses into a new month or year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if adding or subtracting days causes a transition to a new month or year. For example, if adding days causes `DD` to exceed the number of days in the current month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Date Subtraction Function:**\n   - Write a function `subtract_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days from a given date, using similar logic to the addition function but in reverse.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle both addition and subtraction of days, allowing for any number of days to be added or subtracted.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the correct rules for date addition and subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the addition and subtraction functions with various dates, including transitions between months and years, and during leap and non-leap years.\n\n9. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to calculate the date 176 days after March 20, 2020.\n   - Then, use the `subtract_days` function to calculate the date one week (7 days) ago from that date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from today's date, considering the specified number of days (176) and handling all necessary date transitions and calculations.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, and that 176 days have passed since then. To solve this problem, we need to calculate today's date by adding 176 days to March 20, 2020, and then adding another 7 days to find the date one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves two parts: calculating today's date based on the number of days passed since a known date, and then adding one week to that date. The challenge is to handle the transitions between months and years accurately when adding a large number of days. In SWI-Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage these date calculations and transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle additions of days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle month and year transitions correctly, considering the number of days in each month and leap years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to check if adding the specified number of days crosses into a new month or year.\n   - If the addition causes the day to exceed the number of days in the current month, adjust the day and month accordingly, and consider year transitions for months like December.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper function to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion within the `add_days` function to handle the addition of a large number of days. If the number of days to add is greater than the days in a month, recursively call the function with the remaining days and the updated date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, adding days that cross into a new month, adding days that cross a year boundary, and handling leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to calculate today's date by adding 176 days to March 20, 2020.\n\n9. **Calculate Date One Week From Today:**\n   - Add 7 days to today's date using the `add_days` function to find the date one week from today.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from today, given a specific starting date and the number of days passed.

The first part requires understanding how to increment days, months, and years correctly, considering the varying number of days in each month and handling leap years. The second part involves applying the same logic to add one more day to the resulting date. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and using recursion to add multiple days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day, month, and year arithmetic.\n\n2. **Date Incrementation Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_date(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a certain number of days to a given date.\n   - This rule should handle month and year transitions correctly, considering the number of days in each month and leap years.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when incrementing days.

        "question": "2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date, given that 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now is equivalent to one and a half days, which means today is the day before New Year's Eve, December 30, 2014. Therefore, the date today is 12/30/2014 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the current date based on the information that 2015 is approaching in 36 hours. This involves understanding the concept of time intervals and date manipulation. In SWI-Prolog, we can use rules and predicates to perform date arithmetic and determine the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date manipulation and arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Time Interval Calculation:**\n   - Implement a predicate that calculates the time interval between two dates. For example, \"36 hours\" can be represented as `time_interval(36, hour)`.\n\n3. **Date Incrementation:**\n   - Define a predicate that increments a date by a given time interval. This will involve adding the appropriate number of days and hours to the current date.\n\n4. **Handling Hour Rollover:**\n   - Consider the case where the hour count exceeds 24, indicating a transition to the next day. This logic will be crucial for correctly determining today's date from the given time interval.\n\n5. **Current Date Calculation:**\n   - Create a predicate that takes the time interval until 2015 as input and calculates today's date by decrementing that interval from the known date of January 1, 2015.\n\n6. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when incrementing or decrementing dates. This will ensure that the date is adjusted correctly, especially when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and unification to apply the correct rules for date manipulation based on the given time interval.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various time intervals, including those that span across month and year boundaries, to ensure that the date calculations are accurate.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can determine today's date based on the given time interval until 2015, taking into account hour rollovers and date transitions.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that 2015 is arriving in 36 hours. First, we need to calculate today's date based on the information provided. There are 24 hours in a day, so 36 hours from now is equal to 1 day and 12 hours. This means that in 12 hours, it will be January 1, 2015. Therefore, today's date is December 31, 2014. To find the date for tomorrow, we simply need to add 1 day to today's date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle date arithmetic, including the transition from one year to the next. The challenge is to increment the date correctly, taking into account the number of days in each month and the transition from December to January. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, month transitions, and year increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day and month increments, as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month (e.g., 31 for December), the function should set `MM` to the next month and `DD` to 1.\n\n3. **Handle Month Transitions:**\n   - Add logic to handle the transition from December to January when incrementing days. If `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the function should set `MM` to 1 (January), `DD` to 1, and increment the year.\n\n4. **Handle Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle year increments when necessary. If the current year is 2014 and the month transitions from December to January, the year should be incremented to 2015.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to increment days, months, and years as needed. This will allow for the correct handling of various date arithmetic scenarios.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to select the appropriate rules for date manipulation based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to validate the correctness of the `increment_day` function, including transitions between months, years, and leap years.\n\n9. **Calculate Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Given today's date (December 31, 2014), use the `increment_day` function to calculate tomorrow's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately determine tomorrow's date, taking into account the transition from one year to the next and handling date arithmetic correctly.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days before the arrival of the year 2015, which is assumed to be in 36 hours. First, we need to calculate the date that is 36 hours away, which would be January 1, 2015, as it is the start of a new year. Then, we need to find the date that is 10 days before that, which involves subtracting 10 days from January 1, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform two main steps: calculate the date 36 hours away, and then calculate the date 10 days before that. The first step involves adding 36 hours to the current time, which can be done by adding 1.5 days. The second step involves subtracting 10 days from the resulting date. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for dates and times, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(HH, MM, SS)`.\n   - Ensure that the structures can handle arithmetic operations for adding hours and days.\n\n2. **Adding 36 Hours:**\n   - Write a rule to add 36 hours to the current time, which involves adding 1.5 days. This calculation should consider the transition from one day to the next and any month or year changes.\n\n3. **Date Calculation for 2015:**\n   - Calculate the date that is 36 hours away, which, in this case, would be January 1, 2015. This involves adding 1.5 days to the current date and handling any month or year transitions.\n\n4. **Subtracting 10 Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract 10 days from a given date. This rule should handle month and year transitions, especially when subtracting days that cross into a different month or year.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to manage transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, subtracting 10 days from January 1, 2015, would result in a date in December 2014.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days or adding time.\n\n7. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of 36 hours and the subtraction of 10 days. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in selecting the correct rules based on the current date and time.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates and times to ensure accurate calculations.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the date when someone claims that \"2015 is coming in 36 hours.\" This statement indicates that in 36 hours, it will be the year 2015. To find the date 24 hours after that, we need to calculate the date 60 hours (36 hours for \"2015 is coming\" plus 24 hours for \"24 hours later\") from now.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date calculations involving both time intervals and year transitions. We are given an indirect reference to a date (\"2015 is coming\") and asked to calculate a date a certain number of hours later. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations, taking into account the transition into the year 2015 and then adding another 24 hours.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(YYYY, MM, DD, HH)` to represent the year, month, day, and hour components of a date and time.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding hours and adjusting dates.\n\n2. **Calculate Current Date and Time:**\n   - Write a rule to determine the current date and time, including the hour, when the statement is made. This will serve as the starting point for calculations.\n\n3. **Add 36 Hours for \"2015 is coming\":**\n   - Implement a rule to add 36 hours to the current date and time. This will bring us to the moment when it becomes the year 2015.\n\n4. **Transition to Year 2015:**\n   - Ensure that the year component is updated to 2015 when adding the 36 hours, handling any month and day adjustments that may be necessary due to the time interval.\n\n5. **Add Another 24 Hours:**\n   - Write a rule to add another 24 hours to the date and time after transitioning to 2015. This will give us the desired date and time, which is 24 hours after the start of 2015.\n\n6. **Handling Date and Time Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to handle cases where adding hours causes an overflow in the day, month, or year components. For example, adding 24 hours to November 30 should result in December 1.\n\n7. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of 36 hours, the transition to 2015, and then the addition of another 24 hours.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to convert a date from the UK format (DD/MM/YYYY) to the standard MM/DD/YYYY format used in the previous examples. Given the UK date of 02/01/1987, we need to rearrange the day and month components to obtain the equivalent date in the desired format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves rearranging the components of a date to match a different format. Specifically, we need to swap the day and month parts of the date. In Prolog, we can achieve this by deconstructing the given date, swapping the values of the day and month, and then reconstructing the date in the desired format.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the standard MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Define another structure, `uk_date(DD, MM, YYYY)`, to represent dates in the UK format (DD/MM/YYYY).\n\n2. **Date Conversion:**\n   - Write a rule to convert a `uk_date` to a `date`. This rule should deconstruct the `uk_date`, swap the values of `DD` and `MM`, and then construct a `date` with the swapped values.\n\n3. **Swapping Values:**\n   - Implement logic to swap the values of `DD` and `MM`. This can be done by using temporary variables or by directly assigning the values in reverse order.\n\n4. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various UK format dates to ensure the conversion rule works correctly. For example, test cases could include dates like 01/02/2023, 12/03/1999, and so on.\n\n5. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date in UK format and receive the equivalent date in the standard MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**\n   - Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs, such as dates with incorrect ranges for day, month, or year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a simple Prolog program that can convert dates between the UK format and the standard MM/DD/YYYY format.

Tomorrow's date will be February 2, 1987, or 02/02/1987 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current day by one while considering the month-day boundary. In the UK format, the day is represented before the month, so we need to ensure that the day increment is handled correctly. In Prolog, we can define rules for day increments and month-end transitions to solve this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (day, month, year).\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day increments and month-end transitions.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month. For example, if `DD` is 1 and `MM` is 2 (February), the next date should be February 2, 1987.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day is the last day of the current month. For instance, if the date is January 31, the next date should be February 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from December to January of the next year when necessary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Consider a leap year check to correctly manage the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define rules for transitioning from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n   - Use pattern matching to ensure the correct application of rules based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including normal day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.\n   - Verify that the program handles leap years correctly, especially when incrementing days in February during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine tomorrow's date based on the given UK-formatted date, handling day increments and month transitions appropriately.

In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (day/month/year).\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Month Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n3. **Adjusting Day Component:**\n   - When subtracting a month, ensure that the day component remains valid. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day, adjust the day to the last day of the new month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the subtraction of multiple months, repeatedly applying the single-month subtraction rule until the desired number of months has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for month subtraction based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a month from January, February in both leap and non-leap years, and other months with different day counts.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date in the UK format and receive the date one month prior, providing clear instructions and handling invalid inputs.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month before a given date in the UK format, handling month and year transitions, day adjustments, and leap years effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is given as 02/01/1987 in the UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY). To calculate the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the given date while considering the structure of the date format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting one year from the given date. This involves decrementing the year by 1 while ensuring that the resulting date is valid, taking into account the number of days in each month and handling potential leap years. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to handle date manipulation and perform the necessary calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (day, month, year).\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a predicate `subtract_year(date(DD, MM, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from the given date.\n   - If the current year is a leap year (e.g., 1988), and the month and day are both 2/29, set the new date to 2/28/1987. Otherwise, simply decrement the year by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the `subtract_year` predicate, include logic to handle adjustments to the month and day when necessary. For example, if the current month is January (MM is 1), and the day is greater than the number of days in that month (DD is greater than 31), decrement the month to 12 and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling the end of February during leap years.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_year` predicate with various dates, including leap year dates, non-leap year dates, and dates that span month boundaries (e.g., January 31 to February 1).\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date in the UK format and receive the date one year prior.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Consider using recursive rules to handle more complex date arithmetic, such as subtracting multiple years or performing other date calculations.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can calculate the date one year prior to a given date, taking into account the UK date format and handling various date adjustments and special cases, such as leap years and month-end transitions.",

        "question": "In the UK, people usually put the day before the month when formatting the date. Therefore, today is 02/01/1987 to them. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours from now, given that today's date in the UK format is 02/01/1987, where the day is written before the month. This date format is different from the standard MM/DD/YYYY format. To calculate the date 24 hours from now, we need to add one day to the given date, considering the month and year as well.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, adding one day to the given date while taking into account the month and year. In the UK format, the day is represented first, followed by the month and then the year. We need to ensure that our calculations consider this format correctly. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules and predicates to handle date manipulation and addition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (day, month, year).\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like adding days while considering month and year boundaries.\n\n2. **Add One Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_one_day(date(DD, MM, YYYY), NewDate)` that adds one day to the given date.\n   - This function should handle cases where adding one day causes a transition to the next month or even year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_one_day` function, include logic to check if adding one day results in a transition to the next month. If `DD` is the last day of the month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n   - Special handling is needed for December (transition to a new year): if `MM` is 12 and `DD` is 31, set `MM` to 1, `DD` to 1, and increment `YYYY`.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years. If a leap year is detected, adjust the end date of February to 29 days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that repeatedly applies `add_one_day` until the desired number of days (in this case, 1 day) has been added.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date. For example, match the pattern `date(31, 12, YYYY)` to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_one_day` function with various dates, including month-end and year-end transitions, to ensure correct behavior. For instance, test adding one day to 02/01/1987, 12/31/2023, and dates in February during leap and non-leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Apply the `add_one_day` function once to the given date to find the date 24 hours later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours later from a given date in UK format, considering month and year transitions, and handling leap years correctly.",

If Jane's flight is booked for tomorrow, then today is one day before July 29, 2002, which is July 28, 2002.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one day before the given date, July 29, 2002.

For example, if today is the 31st of a month, moving one day back should result in the 30th of the same month.\n   - Special handling is needed for December, as moving one day back from January 1 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n3. **Month-End and Year-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years correctly. For example, moving one day back from January 1 should result in December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is July 28, 2002 (the day before July 29, 2002). To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting a year from a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between different months and years correctly. In this case, subtracting one year from July 28, 2002, would take us back to July 28, 2001. However, we need to consider the number of days in each month and adjust for leap years. Prolog can be used to implement these calculations by defining rules for date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and leap year handling.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Years:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the current year is a leap year, and the date is in February, adjust the date to February 29 of the previous year.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition between months when subtracting years. For example, if the date is January 31, subtracting one year should result in January 31 of the previous year, but if the date is February 28, it should adjust to February 28 or 29 depending on leap years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Create a predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that subtracts one year from a date by repeatedly applying the rule for subtracting a single year until one year has been subtracted.\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule for day and month adjustments based on the current date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including regular years, leap years, and different months. For example, subtracting one year from July 28, 2002, should result in July 28, 2001. Subtracting one year from February 28, 2000 (a leap year), should give February 28, 1999.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows the user to input a date and receive the date one year prior.

If `DD` reaches the maximum number of days in the current month (`MM`), then the rule should trigger a month increment and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n3. **Month Increment Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the month (`MM`) by 1 when `DD` exceeds the maximum days in the current month. This rule should also handle the transition from December to January by incrementing the year (`YYYY`) and resetting `MM` to 1.\n\n4. **Year Increment Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to increment the year (`YYYY`) when the month transitions from December to January.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during month and date calculations.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date, such as incrementing the day, month, or year.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that validate the correct date transitions, including crossing month boundaries (e.g., July 31 to August 1) and year boundaries (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 24 hours later from a given date, considering month transitions and handling leap years.",

In Prolog, we can solve this problem by defining rules for date arithmetic, including month and year transitions, and handling the specific day within each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle month increments and fixed-day calculations.\n\n2. **Increment Month Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_months(date(MM, DD, YYYY), MonthsToAdd, NewDate)` that increments the month by `MonthsToAdd`. Handle month-end transitions by resetting `MM` to 1 and incrementing `YYYY` if necessary.\n\n3. **Fixed Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to ensure that the day (`DD`) remains 16 during the month increments.

        "question": "Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from the October of 2009. It is her 5th visit to the bookstore today. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday based on the information that Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, and today is her 5th visit starting from October 2009. This problem involves calculating the date of the previous visit and then determining the date one day before that. Given that today is Jane's 5th visit, yesterday would be one day before the date of her 4th visit, which occurred on February 16, 2010. Therefore, the date yesterday would be February 15, 2010, or 02/15/2010 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the dates of Jane's bookstore visits and then determine the date one day prior to her 4th visit. This involves understanding the pattern of her visits (16th of each month) and keeping track of the months and years as we move from one visit to the next. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to generate the dates of her visits and then apply a day subtraction to find the date of her 4th visit, ultimately determining the date yesterday.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like adding and subtracting months and days.\n\n2. **Jane's Bookstore Visit Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that generates the dates of Jane's bookstore visits. Given a starting date (e.g., October 2009) and the pattern (16th of each month), calculate the dates for each visit sequentially.\n\n3. **Month Addition Logic:**\n   - Implement a function to add months to a given date, considering the varying number of days in each month and handling year transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Day Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a function to subtract one day from a given date, handling month-end and year-end transitions correctly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Visit Dates:**\n   - Use recursion to generate the dates of Jane's visits. Start with the initial date and recursively apply the \"add one month\" function until you reach her 4th visit.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the month addition and day subtraction steps.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month addition and day subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that Jane's visit dates are calculated correctly and that the day subtraction step handles various scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of Jane's 4th bookstore visit and then calculate the date yesterday based on that information, taking into account the pattern of her visits and any relevant date transitions.",

        "question": "Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from the October of 2009. It is her 5th visit to the bookstore today. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, starting from October 2009. Today is her 5th visit, which means four months have passed since her first visit. To find the date one month ago, we need to calculate the date of her 4th visit and then subtract another month. Her 4th visit would have been on February 16, 2010, and one month before that would be January 16, 2010, or 01/16/2010 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate dates based on a recurring monthly event and then subtract two months from the most recent event date. This involves understanding month transitions and ensuring that the correct date is selected within each month. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to calculate the dates of Jane's visits and then subtract months as needed.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle month additions and subtractions.\n\n2. **Jane's Visit Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Jane's visit based on the starting date (October 2009) and the number of visits. This rule should add the correct number of months to the starting date while ensuring the day remains the 16th.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a function to subtract one or more months from a given date. This logic should handle month-end transitions (e.g., from January to December) and year transitions (e.g., from December to November).\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting months. If the resulting date lands on a non-existent day (e.g., February 30), adjust it to the last day of that month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate the dates of Jane's visits and to subtract months. This will allow for dynamic calculation based on the number of visits.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for month addition and subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that Jane's visit dates are calculated correctly for various numbers of visits, including visits that span over year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month ago based on Jane's recurring visits to the bookstore, taking into account month transitions and potential leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nJane's 5th visit to the bookstore falls on the 16th of the month, and she started these visits in October 2009. To find the date one week from today, we need to calculate the date of her 5th visit and then add 7 days to it. Given that her visits started in October 2009, her 5th visit would be in March 2010, which is 5 months later.

The solution will involve defining rules to handle day increments and month boundaries in SWI-Prolog.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, `increment_day(date(3, 11, 2002), date(3, 12, 2002)`.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month. For instance, if the date is January 31, the next date should be February 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases for various scenarios, including normal day increments, transitions between months, and year-end transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one day after a given date, considering potential month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and handling date boundaries using SWI-Prolog's capabilities.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is March 12, 2002. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current date. This involves handling the transition from one year to another, going back from 2002 to 2001.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires subtracting one year from a given date, taking into account any month and day adjustments that might be necessary due to the transition between years. In this case, going back one year from March 12, 2002, would be March 12, 2001. However, since 2001 is a leap year, we need to consider the extra day in February, which would make the correct date March 11, 2001.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like subtracting years.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing `YYYY` by 1 and then adjusting `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Within the `subtract_year` rule, include logic to handle the transition between months and days correctly. For example, if the original date is January 31, going back one year should result in January 31 of the previous year since January exists in both years.\n   - Special cases, such as February in leap years, should be considered when adjusting the month and day.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate `is_leap_year(YYYY)` to determine if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during year subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - If necessary, use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another or from one day to the next within the `subtract_year` rule. This may be useful for adjusting the month and day correctly.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to ensure that the correct month and day adjustments are made based on the original date and the year being subtracted.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as subtracting a year from dates in different months, including the end of the year, and considering leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of one year, resulting in the expected date one year prior.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one year ago from a given date, taking into account month and day adjustments, as well as leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that today is March 12, 2002. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from March 12, 2002, which falls within the same month. Therefore, the date one week ago would be March 5, 2002, represented as 03/05/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting a specific number of days (7 days) from a given date, which requires handling the transition between days within the same month. In this case, the calculation does not span across month or year boundaries, simplifying the logic. Prolog can be used to define rules for decrementing days and handling potential month and year transitions, even though they are not applicable in this specific case.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations for subtracting days from a given date.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. If `Days` is greater than `DD`, decrement `DD` by `Days` and set `NewDate` accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Although not applicable in this case, include logic to handle transitions to the previous month or year if the day subtraction results in a negative day value. For example, subtracting 15 days from March 5 would lead to February, and potentially the previous year.\n\n4. **Month-End and Year-End Adjustments:**\n   - Implement rules to adjust the day, month, and year when subtracting days results in a date before the start of the month or year. For instance, subtracting 30 days from January 31 should lead to December 31 of the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to correctly apply rules for day subtraction, month transitions, and year transitions, ensuring that the resulting date is accurate.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `subtract_days` rule with various scenarios, including subtracting days within the same month, crossing month boundaries, and spanning across years. Verify that the logic correctly handles transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date some days prior to a given date, considering potential transitions and adjustments due to month and year boundaries, even though this specific case does not require such complex logic.",

Since it is the first day of the year, the month is January, and the day is 1.

The challenge is to correctly represent the date in the desired format and ensure that Prolog can interpret and manipulate the date components effectively. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date structures and format the output accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, where `MM` is the month, `DD` is the day, and `YYYY` is the year.\n\n2. **Input and Output Format:**\n   - Specify that the input will be provided as facts representing the month, day, and year. For example: `month(1).`, `day(1).`, and `year(2007).`\n   - Define the desired output format as a single atom representing the date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n3. **Date Construction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that constructs the date structure based on the input facts. This rule should unify the `month/1`, `day/1`, and `year/1` predicates with their respective values.\n\n4. **Formatting Output:**\n   - Implement a rule or a set of rules to format the date structure into the desired MM/DD/YYYY format. This may involve using Prolog's string concatenation and number formatting predicates.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases for different dates to ensure that the program correctly constructs and formats the dates.

This can be represented as 01/02/2007 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross any month or year boundaries, which is not a concern in this case since we are only moving one day forward within January 2007. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day while considering potential month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule named `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month and year. For example, if `Date` is `date(1, 1, 2007)`, then `NewDate` should be `date(1, 2, 2007)`.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific case, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This will ensure that the code works for any date within a year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds December.

This problem involves understanding how dates wrap around at the end of the year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from the first day of the year to the last day of the previous year. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage year transitions and correctly identify the last day of the preceding year.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle year transitions and day decrements.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that specifically handles the transition from the first day of the year to the last day of the previous year. For example, if `date(1, 1, YYYY)` is given, the rule should return `date(12, 31, YYYY-1)`.\n\n3. **Normal Day Decrement:**\n   - Implement a rule that decrements the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the first day of the month.

For example, if `MM` is 1 (January) and `DD` needs to be decremented, then `MM` should become 12 (December), and `DD` should be adjusted accordingly.\n   - Also, handle the transition from one year to another when decrementing days in December.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `decrement_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that repeatedly calls `decrement_day` until `Days` reaches 0.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct path for decrementing days, especially when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve transitions between months and years, such as decrementing days from January 1 or December 31.\n   - Verify the correctness of the program by decrementing various numbers of days, including 1 day, 10 days, and dates that span over multiple months or years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate a date some days ago from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as month-end and year-end scenarios.

In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, specifically for incrementing days while handling month and year boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` that takes a date and returns the next day.\n   - If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment `DD` by 1.\n   - If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should handle the transition to the next month and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transition:**\n   - Within the `increment_day` rule, include logic to check if `DD` is the last day of the month. If so, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Handle Year-End Transition:**\n   - Special handling is needed for December.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane's appointment, which is three days later than April 10, 1985. To find the date of the appointment, we simply add three days to April 10, 1985. This calculation yields April 13, 1985, as the date of Jane's appointment.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic by adding three days to a given date. This involves incrementing the day count by three while considering potential month and year transitions. In this case, adding three days to April 10 does not cross into the next month or year, so the calculation is straightforward. Prolog can be used to define rules for date addition and handling month and year boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` that adds `DaysToAdd` to the given date. If `DD + DaysToAdd` exceeds the number of days in the month, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `add_days` to handle transitions between months. If adding days exceeds the current month's days, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should be adjusted within the new month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle adding multiple days. If `DaysToAdd` is greater than 1, recursively call `add_days` with decremented `DaysToAdd` until it reaches 0.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct path for date addition, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, crossing into a new month, and crossing into a new year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane's appointment, which is three days after April 10, 1985, and then find the date for the day after that appointment. Today, April 10, 1985, can be represented as the date `date(4, 10, 1985)`. Jane's appointment falls on April 13, 1985, which is three days later and can be represented as `date(4, 13, 1985)`. Tomorrow's date will be one day after the appointment, on April 14, 1985, represented as `date(4, 14, 1985)`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, adding days to a given date. This involves incrementing the day, month, or year depending on the number of days added and handling transitions between months and years. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for incrementing days, handling month-end and year-end transitions, and recursively applying these rules to add multiple days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, where `MM` is the month, `DD` is the day, and `YYYY` is the year.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule `increment_day(Date, NewDate)` that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. If `DD` is the last day of the month, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transition:**\n   - Add logic to the `increment_day` rule to handle the transition between months. For example, if today is April 30, then tomorrow should be May 1.\n\n4. **Handle Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Recursive Day Addition:**\n   - Create a recursive predicate `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that repeatedly calls `increment_day` to add multiple days. If `Days` is greater than 1, decrement it and recursively call `add_days` to add the remaining days to the incremented date.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate `leap_year(Year)` to check if a given year is a leap year.

If today is April 10 and Jane's appointment is in three days, then yesterday would be April 9, 1985. The goal is to represent this date in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting one day from the given date. This involves understanding how to decrement days, handle month transitions, and consider year changes if necessary. In Prolog, we can define rules for decrementing days, checking for month-end and year-end transitions, and handling these cases accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the previous day's date. If `DD` is not 1, then `NewDate` should be `date(MM, DD-1, YYYY)`.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transition:**\n   - Within the `decrement_day` function, include logic to check if `DD` is 1, indicating the first day of the month. In this case, the `MM` should decrement by 1, and `DD` should be set to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Handle the transition from December to January when decrementing days. If `MM` is 1 (January) and `DD` needs to be decremented, then `MM` should be set to 12 (December), and `DD` should be decremented accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the appropriate rule for decrementing days based on the current date structure. This will ensure that month-end and year-end transitions are handled correctly.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover normal day decrements, month-end transitions (e.g., from April 10 to April 9), and year-end transitions (e.g., from January 1 to December 31).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date for yesterday based on the given information.

First, we need to calculate Jane's appointment date by adding three days to April 10, 1985, which results in April 13, 1985.

This date, March 13, 1985, is the final answer in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform two main operations: adding days to a date and subtracting one month from a date. Adding days involves incrementing the day count while considering month and year transitions. Subtracting a month requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, month transitions, and year transitions to handle these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day and month arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` that adds `DaysToAdd` to the given date.\n   - This function should handle month and year transitions correctly, e.g., adding days to April 30 should result in a date in May.\n\n3. **Subtract One Month Function:**\n   - Create a function `subtract_month(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the date one month before the given date.\n   - This function should consider the number of days in each month and adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly, e.g., subtracting one month from April should result in a date in March.\n\n4. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `add_days` and `subtract_month` to handle transitions between months, ensuring that the day is valid for the target month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct transition rules when adding days or subtracting a month, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various day counts and dates, including transitions between months and years.\n   - Test the `subtract_month` function for different months, ensuring that the day is adjusted correctly, e.g., subtracting one month from April 30 should result in March 30 in non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate dates a certain number of days later and a certain number of months earlier, considering month and year transitions and handling leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is April 10, 1985. Additionally, Jane's appointment is scheduled for three days later. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from today's date while considering any adjustments required for leap years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including subtracting days and years from a given date. In this case, we have two operations: subtracting three days and then subtracting one year. The challenge is to handle the transition between different months and years accurately, especially when dealing with leap years. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, taking into account the varying number of days in different months and the leap year cycle.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like day and year subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. If the resulting day is less than 1, adjust the month and day accordingly (e.g., subtracting 3 days from April 10 results in April 7).\n\n3. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the month and day are valid for the new year, simply decrement the year. Otherwise, adjust the month and day to the last valid date in the previous year (e.g., subtracting 1 year from April 10, 1985, results in April 10, 1984).\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Ensure that the day and month adjustments during year subtraction consider the varying number of days in different months. For example, subtracting 1 year from January 31 should result in February 28 (or 29 during a leap year).\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the day and year subtraction, allowing for multiple adjustments as needed.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules based on the current date and the number of days/years to subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those near the end of the month or year, to ensure that the day and year subtractions are accurate and handle all possible transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute dates a certain number of days and years in the past, taking into account leap years and various date boundaries.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is April 10, 1985, and Jane's appointment is scheduled for three days later. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to the current date, considering any month or year transitions that might occur.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date manipulation, specifically adding a certain number of days to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to the next. In this case, adding seven days to April 10, 1985, will result in a date in the same month, but we need to ensure that the day adjustment is correct and no month or year transitions are missed.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations that add days to a date.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` that adds `DaysToAdd` to the given date. Use recursive logic to repeatedly call the function with `DaysToAdd` decremented until it reaches zero.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months. If adding a day causes the `DD` to exceed the maximum days in the current month, increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n   - Also, handle the transition from December to January by incrementing `YYYY` and resetting `MM` to 1 if `MM` is 12 (December).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for correctly handling February during leap years when adding days.\n\n5. **Day Overflow Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when adding days. If adding days causes the `DD` to exceed the maximum days in the current month, adjust `DD` to the last day of that month.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for adding days, handling month and year transitions, and adjusting days as needed.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries. Verify that the function correctly handles leap years and day overflows.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date one week from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and adjustments.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane's next meteor shower observation in the year 1973, given that today is her second observation and it is March 5. Since meteor showers typically occur at specific intervals, we can assume that Jane's next observation will be one interval after today's date. Therefore, we need to calculate the date that is one meteor shower interval later.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern or interval between meteor shower occurrences. Let's assume that meteor showers occur at regular intervals throughout the year. We can then calculate the date of the next meteor shower by adding this interval to today's date. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date addition operations.\n\n2. **Meteor Shower Interval:**\n   - Define the interval between meteor showers. Let's assume, for simplicity, that meteor showers occur at a fixed interval of `X` days. This interval can be defined as a constant or a parameter.\n\n3. **Add Interval Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_interval(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Interval, NewDate)` that adds the meteor shower interval to a given date. It should consider month and year transitions when adding the interval.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `add_interval` to handle transitions between months and years. If adding the interval causes the day (`DD`) to exceed the number of days in the current month, increment the month and adjust the day accordingly. If the month exceeds 12, increment the year and reset the month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February when adding intervals. If the year is a leap year, ensure that February has 29 days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of intervals, especially when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for adding intervals, considering month and year transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_interval` function with various dates and interval values to ensure it correctly handles month and year transitions, including leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date of Jane's next meteor shower observation, considering the specified interval and handling date transitions effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday based on the information that today is 3/5, and Jane has seen a meteor shower twice in the year 1973. We can interpret this as Jane seeing a meteor shower on two separate dates in 1973, and today's date, 3/5, is one of those dates. To find the date yesterday, we need to understand the format and make the necessary date adjustments.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves working with dates and interpreting the given information. We can assume that the date format is MM/DD, and based on the context, Jane seeing a meteor shower twice refers to two distinct dates. To find the date yesterday, we need to identify the structure and perform date manipulation. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date structures and built-in predicates to handle date calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Month, Day, Year)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date comparisons and arithmetic.\n\n2. **Interpret Given Information:**\n   - Interpret \"3/5\" as the third meteor shower occurrence in the year 1973. This interpretation is based on the context provided in the question.\n\n3. **Calculate Yesterday's Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate yesterday's date based on the given date format. In SWI-Prolog, you can use built-in predicates like `check_date/3` to validate dates and `date_value/3` to extract individual components.\n   - To find yesterday's date, decrement the `Day` component by 1, and if it becomes 0, decrement the `Month` component by 1 and set `Day` to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Handle Year Information:**\n   - Since the year 1973 is mentioned, ensure that the year component is considered when validating and manipulating dates.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the correctness of the date calculations, especially when dealing with month-end and year-end transitions. For example, validate that yesterday's date for 3/31 is correctly calculated as 3/30, and yesterday's date for 12/31 is correctly calculated as 12/30 with the year decremented.\n\n6. **Use of SWI-Prolog Predicates:**\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's built-in date manipulation predicates, such as `check_date/3`, `date_value/3`, and others, to perform date calculations and validations efficiently.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle date adjustments, especially when dealing with month-end and year-end transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from today's date, which is March 5, 1973. Jane has seen a meteor shower twice this year, implying that there is some significance to this event. To find the date one month ago, we need to subtract one month from today's date, considering any necessary adjustments for month length and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform month subtraction, taking into account the number of days in each month and handling the transition from February to March, as February has only 28 days in a standard year and 29 days in a leap year. Prolog can be used to define rules for month subtraction, handling these transitions and ensuring the correct date is calculated.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle month subtraction and day adjustments.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If `MM` is January, decrement `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to December. Otherwise, decrement `MM` by 1, wrapping around to the previous month.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment for Shorter Months:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the day (`DD`) when subtracting a month results in a shorter month. For example, if the original date is March 31, the resulting date should be February 28 in a standard year or February 29 in a leap year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the month subtraction, repeatedly applying the single-month subtraction rule until one month has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct month subtraction logic is applied based on the current month and year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the month subtraction logic with various dates, including transitions from longer to shorter months (e.g., March 31 to February) and handling leap years correctly (e.g., February 29 to January).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one month prior to a given date, considering month length variations and year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is March 5, 1973, and it is Jane's second meteor shower observation of the year. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to the current date while considering potential month and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date addition, specifically adding seven days to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to the next. In SWI-Prolog, we can use rules and predicates to manage these transitions and correctly calculate the date one week later.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function will handle day increments, month transitions, and year transitions as needed.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if adding days would exceed the number of days in the current month. If so, roll over to the next month and adjust the day count.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from December to January of the next year if adding days crosses the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to add a specified number of days to a date, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries. Test both leap and non-leap years.\n\n9. **Date Calculation for One Week Later:**\n   - Given today's date (03/05/1973), use the `add_days` function with `Days` set to 7 to calculate the date one week from today.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can compute the date one week from a given date, handling month and year transitions and considering leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow based on the given information: \"Yesterday was January 21, 2011.\" To find the date tomorrow, we need to calculate today's date (which is one day after yesterday) and then add another day to find the date for the day after today (i.e., tomorrow).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves date arithmetic, specifically incrementing a given date by two days. The key steps are to handle the transition from one day to the next and to manage month and year boundaries. In Prolog, we can define rules for incrementing days, months, and years, and use recursion to handle multiple increments.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day, month, and year arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n   - For example, if `MM` is 1 (January), `DD` is 31, and we increment by 1, the date should become February 1 of the same year.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n   - For instance, if `MM` is 1 (January) and `DD` is 31, incrementing by 1 should result in `MM` becoming 2 (February) and `DD` rolling over to 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next year when the date exceeds December 31.\n   - For example, if the date is December 31, 2022, and we increment by 1, the date should become January 1, 2023.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to handle multiple increments. For instance, to increment by 2 days, call the increment rule twice recursively.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which will impact the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure the correct application of rules based on the current date structure during the increment process.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve transitions between months (e.g., January 31 to February 1), between years (e.g., December 31 to January 1), and during leap years (e.g., February 28 to February 29).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow by handling the correct transition from yesterday's date to today's date and then to tomorrow's date, considering month and year boundaries, and using recursion for multiple increments.",

In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and using recursion to add the specified number of days.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days, months, or years.\n\n2. **Calculate Today's Date:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - Use this function to calculate today's date by adding 1 day to January 21, 2011.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to handle transitions between months and years.\n   - If adding days causes a transition to a new month or year, update the `MM` and `YYYY` values accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to add a specified number of days to a date. For example, to add seven days, recursively call the `add_days` function seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to correctly apply the date arithmetic operations and handle month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding days within the same month, across month boundaries (e.g., from January 31 to February 1), and across year boundaries (e.g., from December 31 to January 1).\n\n8. **Calculate Date One Week from Today:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to add 7 days to today's date, which is one day after January 21, 2011.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one week from today, given a past date. This involves defining rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year transitions, and using recursion to add the desired number of days.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the given date, January 21, 2011. This involves incrementing the date by one day, which is a straightforward addition of 24 hours to the time. The result will be January 22, 2011, represented as 01/22/2011 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires a simple increment of the day within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross any month or year boundaries, which is not a concern in this case since January has 31 days. In SWI-Prolog, we can handle this with a basic rule that increments the day while considering potential month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can accommodate basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1, considering potential month-end transitions. For instance, if `MM` is 1 (representing January) and `DD` is 31, the next date should be February 1 of the same year.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to manage the transition to the next month when necessary. This rule will be applied if incrementing the day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January of the next year when day increments cross the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check for leap years, which will be crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to manage transitions from one day to the next, taking month-end and year-end transitions into account.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the initial date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases that validate normal day transitions (e.g., January 21 to January 22), month-end transitions (e.g., January 31 to February 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide users in creating a SWI-Prolog program capable of computing the date 24 hours later from a given input date.

This rule should adjust the month and reset the day to 1.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year. This will ensure that the year is correctly incremented when necessary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to correctly handle the end of February, which has 28 or 29 days depending on the leap year status.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for incrementing the date by one day.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day increments and month/year transitions based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that span month-end and year-end transitions, such as December 30 to December 31, and December 31 to January 1.\n   - Include test cases for leap years to ensure that the end of February is handled correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date tomorrow based on the given input, considering potential transitions between days, months, and years. This involves defining rules for date increments, handling special cases, and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nGiven that Jane is correct and today's date is June 18, 2019, the task is to determine the date one week from today. To calculate this, we need to add 7 days to the current date. One week from today would be June 25, 2019, represented as 06/25/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe problem involves adding a specific number of days (7 days) to a given date while handling potential month and year transitions. In this case, adding 7 days to June 18, 2019, remains within the same month. However, the solution should be general enough to handle transitions to the next month or even year if the addition spans a longer period. SWI-Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling these transitions correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to add a specified number of days to a given date.\n\n3. **Normal Day Addition:**\n   - Implement a rule within `add_days` to handle the addition of a single day. If `DD` is not the last day of `MM`, increment `DD` by 1.\n\n4. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Include logic in `add_days` to handle the transition to the next month when `DD` exceeds the number of days in the current month. For example, adding one day to May 31 should result in June 1.\n\n5. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Handle the transition from December to January in `add_days`. If the month is December, and adding days exceeds the days in December, increment the year and reset the month and day accordingly.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle February during leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from June 18, 2019, given that Jane's belief of the date (June 18, 2019) is correct. To find the date 24 hours later, we simply need to add one day to this date, resulting in June 19, 2019. This can be represented as 06/19/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing a given date by one day, taking into account month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, including day increments, month transitions, and handling leap years. By applying these rules, we can calculate the date 24 hours later from the given input.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments and month/year transitions.\n\n2. **Day Increment Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by one. If the resulting day exceeds the maximum for the given month, carry over to the next month.\n   - For example, incrementing June 18 (06/18) by one day should result in June 19 (06/19).\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle month transitions when the day increment causes a carryover to the next month. This rule should adjust the month (`MM`) and reset the day (`DD`) accordingly.\n   - For instance, incrementing May 31 (05/31) by one day should result in June 1 (06/01).\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle year transitions when incrementing days causes a carryover from December to January. This rule should increment the year (`YYYY`) and reset the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during leap years. If the current year is a leap year, adjust the maximum days in February to 29.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's recursive capabilities to apply the day increment rule repeatedly until the desired number of hours (24) or days (1) have passed.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including month-end and year-end transitions, to ensure correct results. For example, test cases could include June 18 to June 19, December 31 to January 1, and February 28 to February 29 during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours later from a given input date, considering day increments and month/year transitions.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date ten days ago from June 19, 2019, given that John is correct about the current date. Calculating the date ten days in the past involves subtracting ten days from June 19, 2019, which may require handling a transition between months.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of ten days from the given date, considering the possibility of transitioning between months. This involves decrementing the day component and, if necessary, the month component as well. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage this date subtraction, taking into account the varying number of days in each month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day and potential month/year subtractions.\n\n2. **Single Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule that subtracts a single day from the given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the previous month if the day subtraction results in a date before the first day of the current month. For example, if the date is June 2, decrementing ten days should lead to May 23.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to manage the transition to the previous year if the month subtraction reaches January of the same year. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) and rolling back to the last month of the previous year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, ten days) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add logic to check for leap years, which will impact the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to dynamically select the appropriate rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases to validate the correctness of the date subtraction across month and year boundaries, taking into account both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program capable of accurately determining the date ten days ago from a given date, handling potential transitions between days, months, and years effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from June 19, 2019, given that John is correct about the date. Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from this date. Since there are no month or year transitions involved, the date one week ago would be June 12, 2019, represented as 06/12/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of seven days from the given date. This requires a mechanism to decrement the day component of the date while considering potential month and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage this task effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for day, month, and year components.\n\n2. **Single Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule that subtracts one day from the given date. If `DD` is not 1, simply decrement it. If `DD` is 1, then we need to consider a transition to the previous month.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to handle the transition to the previous month when `DD` is 1. This rule should decrement `MM` and adjust `DD` to the last day of the previous month. For example, if the date is June 1 (06/01/2019), subtracting one day should result in May 31 (05/31/2019).\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle year transitions when subtracting days from dates near the start of the year (e.g., January 2 to January 1). This rule should decrement the year and adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add logic to check for leap years, which will impact the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover single-day subtraction, month transitions, and year transitions, ensuring that the rules handle various scenarios correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, considering potential transitions between days, months, and years.

For example, if `MM` is 6 (June) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be June 20, 2019.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not applicable in this specific case, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during day increments.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering potential month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months (e.g., from June 30 to July 1), and transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both regular and potential boundary cases like month and year transitions.

For instance, subtracting a day from May 1 should result in April 30.\n   - Also, handle year transitions when subtracting days that cross December to ensure the year is decremented correctly.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, ten days) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, which will impact the number of days in February when subtracting days that involve this month.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to dynamically select the appropriate rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases that validate the correct date calculation when subtracting ten days, including scenarios that cross month boundaries and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date ten days before a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This involves recursive logic and careful management of date boundaries.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, considering that for Jane, May 6, 1992, feels like yesterday, but it was actually ten years ago. This problem involves calculating the date one year back from the current date, taking into account the time difference perceived by Jane.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract one year from today's date while considering the time discrepancy perceived by Jane. The perceived time difference of ten years when, in reality, it has been a shorter amount of time, adds a layer of complexity to the calculation. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this time discrepancy and accurately calculate the date one year ago.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Calculate Perceived Time Difference:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the perceived time difference between two dates. In this case, the perceived difference is ten years, as May 6, 1992, is like yesterday to Jane.\n\n3. **Adjust for Actual Time Difference:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the perceived time difference to the actual time that has passed. In this case, the actual time difference is less than ten years, so we need to subtract the perceived difference from the current date.\n\n4. **Year Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Create a rule to subtract one year from a given date. If the month and day of the resulting date are higher than the current month and day, adjust the values accordingly (e.g., subtract one from the month and add 12 to the year).\n\n5. **Handling Month and Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the month and day components remain consistent when subtracting a year. If the resulting date has an invalid month or day (e.g., February 30), adjust the values to the valid range.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to another, considering any adjustments needed for month and day values.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules based on the input dates and perceived time differences.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that validate the perceived time difference calculation and the subsequent adjustment for the actual time difference. Test various dates to ensure the year subtraction logic works correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can determine the date one year ago from today, considering the unique time perception of Jane.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that Jane feels like May 6, 1992, is like yesterday, but it was actually ten years ago. This problem involves two parts: calculating the correct date that is ten years ahead of May 6, 1992, and then determining the date one week ago from that calculated date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including adding ten years to a given date and then subtracting seven days (one week) from that new date.

This involves incrementing the year by 10 and then handling any adjustments for leap years and varying month lengths.\n\n3. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during the year addition.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - When adding ten years, consider the possibility of the resulting month having fewer days than the original month. Adjust the day and month accordingly to ensure a valid date.\n\n5. **Subtracting Days Rule:**\n   - Write another rule to subtract seven days from a given date, considering month and year boundaries.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that for Jane, May 6, 1992, feels like yesterday, but it was actually ten years ago. This problem involves calculating a date in the future relative to a past date. First, we need to calculate today's date by adding ten years to May 6, 1992, which would be May 6, 2002. Then, we need to add seven days to that date to find the date one week from today.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires date manipulation, including adding years and days to a given date. We need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when adding days. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage these transitions and calculate the correct date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like adding years and days.\n\n2. **Adding Years Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to add a certain number of years to a given date. This involves incrementing the year (`YYYY`) and handling any necessary adjustments to the month and day due to leap years or varying month lengths.\n\n3. **Adding Days Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to add a certain number of days to a given date. This rule should handle the transition between months and years when adding days. For example, adding seven days to May 6 may result in a date in the next month or even year.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the next month or year when adding days. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the current month, increment the month, and if the month exceeds 12, increment the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February when adding days or years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to apply the day-adding rule repeatedly until the desired number of days (seven days) has been added.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and the number of days or years being added.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those near month and year boundaries, to ensure that the correct transitions are made when adding days or years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from today, relative to a past date, taking into account all necessary date transitions and adjustments.",

Since May has 31 days, there is no need to consider a month transition for this specific case. The focus is on ensuring that the day is incremented correctly. In Prolog, we can use a straightforward rule to handle this day increment.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure is designed to handle operations like incrementing days within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1, considering that the month remains the same. In this case, if `MM` is 5 (May) and `DD` is 6, the next date should be May 7, 1992.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not applicable to this specific date, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next month if the incremented day exceeds the number of days in the current month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule to handle the transition to the next year if the incremented month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a rule to check for leap years, which is not necessary for this specific date but will be useful for handling February in other cases.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to manage transitions from one day to the next, taking into account potential month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date, allowing for dynamic adjustments as needed.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases that validate simple day increments within the same month, as well as transitions between months and years, to ensure the code handles various scenarios accurately.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a straightforward Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours after a given date, taking into account potential date transitions and special cases, even though this specific example is relatively simple.",

Christmas Eve falls on December 24 each year, so the date in question is December 24, 1937.

        "question": "Today is Christmas Eve of 1937. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nGiven that today is Christmas Eve, December 24, 1937, the task is to determine the date one week from today. Christmas Eve falls on December 24 each year, so today's date is indeed 12/24/1937. One week from today would be New Year's Eve, December 31, 1937, which can be represented as 12/31/1937 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known holiday, Christmas Eve. The key is to understand the date of Christmas Eve (December 24) and then perform a simple one-week (seven-day) addition to that date. In Prolog, this can be achieved by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling month and year boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Christmas Eve Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Christmas Eve for a given year. In this case, Christmas Eve is always on December 24, so the rule is straightforward.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function will handle day increments, month transitions, and year transitions as necessary.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `add_days` function to check for month and year transitions when adding days. For example, if adding days crosses into a new month, update the month and reset the day to 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date addition based on the current date and the number of days being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that cover various scenarios, such as adding days within the same month, crossing into a new month, crossing into a new year, and handling leap years.\n\n8. **Calculate One Week Later:**\n   - Using the `add_days` function, add seven days to the date of Christmas Eve, 12/24/1937, to find the date one week later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one week after Christmas Eve in 1937, considering the structure of dates and the handling of month and year transitions.

        "question": "Today is Christmas Eve of 1937. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from Christmas Eve of 1937. Christmas Eve is on December 24, so the date in question is December 24, 1937. Adding 24 hours to this date will take us to December 25, 1937, which is Christmas Day. This date can be represented as 12/25/1937 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the day from December 24 to December 25 within the same year. The main consideration is handling the transition from one day to the next without crossing any month or year boundaries. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules to increment the day and handle month-end and year-end transitions, ensuring that the date is updated correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month-end and year-end transitions. In this case, the rule should simply add 1 to the day since there are no transitions to handle.\n\n3. **Month-End and Year-End Transitions:**\n   - Include rules to handle transitions to the next month and year when necessary. For example, if the day is the last day of the month, roll over to the first day of the next month, and if it is December 31, transition to January 1 of the next year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a function to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. In this case, the recursion will simply add 1 to the day.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date, ensuring that day, month, and year increments are handled appropriately.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions (e.g., December 24 to 25), month-end transitions (e.g., November 30 to December 1), and year-end transitions (e.g., December 31 to January 1).\n\n8. **Date Calculation for 24 Hours Later:**\n   - Given the initial date of December 24, 1937, use the `increment_day` rule to calculate the date 24 hours later by adding 1 day.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later from Christmas Eve of 1937, handling day increments and considering potential month and year transitions, although in this specific case, the transition is straightforward.",

        "question": "Today is the palindrome day of 2020, because the MMDDYYYY format of the date is the same backwards as forwards. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of the palindrome day in 2020, which occurs when the date in MMDD format is the same when read forwards and backwards. In the year 2020, there were several palindrome dates, including 02/02/2020, 03/03/2020, 04/04/2020, and so on. To find the specific date being referred to, we need to identify the one that satisfies the condition for being a palindrome.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify dates within the year 2020 that meet the palindrome criteria. This involves iterating through the months and days to find dates where the month and day digits are the same when read forwards and backwards. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for generating dates and checking their palindrome property.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Generate Dates in 2020:**\n   - Write a rule to generate all possible dates within the year 2020. This can be done by iterating through the months (MM) from 01 to 12 and the days (DD) from 01 to the maximum number of days in each month.\n\n3. **Check for Palindrome Dates:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if a given date is a palindrome. This can be done by comparing the month and day digits when read forwards and backwards. For example, `02/02/2020` is a palindrome because '02' is the same forwards and backwards.\n\n4. **Filter Palindrome Dates:**\n   - Use Prolog's filtering capabilities to find dates that satisfy the palindrome condition. This can be achieved by applying the palindrome check to all generated dates for the year 2020.\n\n5. **Find Specific Palindrome Date:**\n   - To identify the exact date being referred to, additional context or constraints may be needed. For example, if there are multiple palindrome dates in 2020, we might need to consider the day of the week or a specific event associated with the date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and recursion to generate and filter dates efficiently.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to validate the palindrome check for various dates within the year 2020.\n   - Consider test cases for non-palindrome dates to ensure the rule correctly identifies non-matching dates.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can identify palindrome dates within the year 2020 and, with additional context, can pinpoint the specific palindrome date being referenced. This involves generating dates, checking for the palindrome property, and using Prolog's filtering capabilities to find dates that meet the criteria.",

Yesterday's date would be February 1, 2020, which can be represented as 02/01/2020.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date one day prior to the given palindrome date. The solution requires understanding how to decrement a date by one day, considering the transition from one month to another, and handling the year component accordingly. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these operations effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day decrements.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Implement a function `decrement_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the previous day's date.\n   - If `DD` is not 1, simply decrement it by 1. However, if `DD` is 1, then check the number of days in the month and adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End and Year-End Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the previous month if `DD` is 1. If `MM` is also 1 (January), then decrement `YYYY` by 1 and set `MM` to 12 (December).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the previous day, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases that validate the `decrement_day` function for various scenarios, including normal day decrements, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions, taking leap years into account.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can determine the date one day prior to the palindrome day of 2020, handling date arithmetic and transitions between days, months, and years effectively.",

In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for year subtraction and validating dates.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), date(MM, DD, NewYYYY))` to decrement the year by one.\n   - Handle cases where year subtraction results in a date that does not exist (e.g., February 29 in a non-leap year).\n\n3. **Date Validation:**\n   - Implement a rule `validate_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY))` to check if a given date is valid for the specified month and year.\n   - This rule should consider the number of days in each month and handle leap years.\n\n4. **Handling Invalid Dates:**\n   - Define logic to adjust invalid dates. For example, if the date is February 29, 2019, it should be adjusted to March 1, 2019.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to determine if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February dates.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for year subtraction and date validation based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for year subtraction in various scenarios, including regular years, leap years, and dates that require adjustment (e.g., February 29 in a non-leap year).\n\n8. **Apply Year Subtraction:**\n   - Use the `subtract_year` rule to calculate the date one year before the palindrome date (02/02/2020).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one year before a given date, ensuring that the resulting date is valid and handling special cases like leap years and date adjustments. This will involve defining rules for year subtraction and date validation, leveraging Prolog's pattern matching and search capabilities.",

In this case, the rule should transform 02/02/2020 to 02/03/2020.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. For example, if the date is January 31, the next date should be February 1 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Consider a leap year check to correctly manage the end of February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to manage transitions from one day to the next, taking month-end and year-end transitions into account.\n\n7. **Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases for regular day increments, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.

Since we are not given a specific date, we can assume it is the end of December 1899, which is December 31, 1899. One month before this date would be November 30, 1899, as November has 30 days.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one month before the end of a given year. This involves understanding how to handle the transition from one month to another and considering the possibility of different month lengths. In SWI-Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation and transitions to handle this task effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule to handle the transition from one month to another when subtracting a month. If the current month is not the first month (January), simply decrement the month. However, if it is January, then decrement the year and set the month to December.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement a rule to adjust the day component when subtracting a month results in a day that is higher than the maximum for the new month. For example, if the date is March 31 and we subtract one month, the result should be February 28 (or 29 in a leap year).\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for correctly handling the end of February during a leap year. If the year is a leap year, adjust the end date of February to the 29th.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date one month ago, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rule for month subtraction based on the current date and whether it is a leap year.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that a concert originally scheduled for June 1, 1943, was delayed by one day until June 2, 1943. To find the date tomorrow, we need to add one day to the current date, June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one day ahead of the given date. We need to consider the transition between days, months, and potentially years when adding a day. In this case, adding one day to June 2, 1943, should result in June 3, 1943. Prolog can be used to define rules for incrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to add one day to the given date. If `DD` is the last day of the month, then `MM` should be incremented, and `DD` should be reset to 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `increment_day` to handle transitions between months. If `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is also 31, then the transition should be to January 1 of the following year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February during leap years. If the year is a leap year and `MM` is 2, ensure that February has 29 days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursion to apply the `increment_day` rule repeatedly as needed. This will allow for adding any number of days to a date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct transition rules are applied based on the current date. This will enable accurate date calculations.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `increment_day` function with various dates, including month-end and year-end transitions, to ensure that the function correctly handles all cases, such as adding one day to December 31 or adding multiple days that span across months.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one day ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from today's date, June 2, 1943, which was originally scheduled for June 1, 1943. To find the date one month ago, we need to go back one month from the current date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date one month prior to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between months and potentially between years. In this case, going back one month from June will take us to May, but we need to consider if the current date is at the end of May, which would require an additional transition to the previous year. Prolog can assist in managing these transitions through rule-based logic and pattern matching.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can accommodate operations involving the decrement of days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous month. If the current month is January, then subtracting one month should result in December of the previous year.\n   - For example, going back one month from January 2, 1943, should yield December 2, 1942.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment:**\n   - Develop a rule to adjust the day component when transitioning between months. If the original day does not exist in the target month, adjust it to the last day of that month.\n   - For instance, going back one month from June 2, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943, as May has only 31 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Month Subtraction:**\n   - Create a recursive rule that applies the month subtraction rule repeatedly until one month has been subtracted. This will handle cases where the target date spans across multiple months or years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be crucial for accurately determining the number of days in February during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to identify and apply the correct rules for month transitions and day adjustments.\n   - Ensure that the system selects the appropriate path during recursion to accurately compute the date one month ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month boundaries, such as going back one month from January 31 or February 28/29.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles transitions between months with different day counts, such as going from March 31 to February 28 or 29 during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program capable of calculating the date one month prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and adjustments.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is June 2, 1943. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current date. This involves decrementing the year by 1 while considering any adjustments needed for the month and day due to the varying number of days in different months.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires calculating a date one year prior to a given date. The challenge lies in handling the transition between years, especially when the previous year is a leap year, which could affect the number of days in February. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to manage this transition, taking into account the varying lengths of months and the leap year cycle.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can accommodate subtractions in years, months, and days.\n\n2. **Handling Year Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year by 1 and then adjusting the month and day as needed.\n\n3. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - When subtracting a year, the month and day may need to be adjusted. For example, if today is June 2, subtracting one year should lead to June 2 of the previous year. However, if today's date falls in a month that doesn't exist in the previous year (e.g., February 29), the date needs to be adjusted to the last day of that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check if the previous year is a leap year. This is crucial for determining the number of days in February during the year subtraction. If the previous year is a leap year, and the current date is after February, then the date should be adjusted to February 29.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the transition from one year to another. This rule should consider the varying lengths of months and adjust the month and day accordingly during the transition.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to identify the correct rules to apply for year subtraction, taking into account month and day adjustments.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that span across different months and years, including leap years and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles year subtraction for various dates, such as December 31, January 1, and February 28/29.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating the date one year prior to a given date, considering all necessary adjustments for month and day transitions, as well as handling leap years effectively.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the rescheduled concert date, which is June 2, 1943. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add one day to this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding one day to a given date, considering the transition between days, months, and potentially years. In this case, adding one day to June 2, 1943, should result in the following day, which is June 3, 1943. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation, handling the addition of days and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Addition of a Single Day:**\n   - Write a rule to add one day to a given date. If the current day (`DD`) is the last day of the month (`MM`), then adding one day should set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM`.\n   - For example, adding one day to May 31, 1943, should result in June 1, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to the next and from one year to the next when adding days. For instance, adding one day to December 31, 2023, should result in January 1, 2024.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February during leap years. This will be important for accurate date calculations.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Although the current task only requires adding 24 hours (one day), it is beneficial to create a recursive rule that can add any number of days. This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day addition rule until the desired number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rule is applied based on the current date and the addition of a single day.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the addition of days across various scenarios, including normal day additions, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles leap years, such as adding days to February 28 or 29.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of adding 24 hours (one day) to a given date, considering potential transitions between days, months, and years.

To find \"today's\" date, we need to calculate one day before the given date of July 9, 1972.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date one day prior to a given date. The challenge is to handle the transition between days, months, and potentially years, especially when crossing month boundaries. In this case, going one day back from July 9 falls within the same month, so we only need to consider day and month adjustments. Prolog can be used to define rules for date manipulation and handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day and month adjustments.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition when subtracting a day results in moving to the previous month. For example, if the date is July 1, subtracting one day should lead to June 30 of the same year.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Consider a special case for the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year and resetting the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years, which will be important for accurately handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to another, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that multiple day subtractions are handled correctly.\n\n7. **Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will allow for dynamic handling of various date scenarios.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including normal day subtractions, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.\n   - For example, test subtracting one day from July 9, 2023, to ensure it results in July 8, 2023, and verify that subtracting one day from February 29 during a leap year results in February 28.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one day prior to a given date, considering potential transitions between days, months, and years.

Tomorrow will be Tuesday, July 10, 1972, which can be represented as 07/10/1972 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to increment the current date by one day, taking into account the transition between days of the week and months.

For example, if `MM` is December, and `DD` is incremented past December 31, `MM` should become January, `DD` should reset to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n4. **Day of the Week Calculation:**\n   - Define a rule to calculate the day of the week for a given date.

We need to handle the transition between days of the week, months, and potentially years when subtracting 10 days. In Prolog, we can use built-in predicates and custom rules to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(Day, MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates, where `Day` is the day of the week, `MM` is the month, `DD` is the day of the month, and `YYYY` is the year.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle arithmetic operations for subtracting days.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. This rule should consider the transition between days of the week and months.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from Tuesday, July 9, should result in Monday, July 8.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the previous month and year when subtracting days. If the subtraction crosses into the previous month, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n   - For instance, subtracting 10 days from July 9 should lead to June 29.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, 10 days).

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from a given date, which is Tuesday, July 9, 1972. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from this date, considering the transition between different months and years.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date in the past by subtracting a year from a given date. The challenge lies in handling the transition between years correctly, especially when dealing with leap years or dates that don't exist in certain months (e.g., February 30). In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Subtraction:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the subtraction of one year from a given date. If the year is not a leap year, simply decrement the year by 1. However, if it is a leap year, special handling may be needed for dates in February and March.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to adjust the month and day components of the date when subtracting a year. If the original month and day are valid for the new year, no change is needed. Otherwise, adjust the month and day to the last valid date in the new year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be crucial for correctly handling dates in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Years:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the subtraction of multiple years. This will be useful if the prompt requires calculating dates more than one year in the past.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for year subtraction based on the input date. This will ensure that the transition to the previous year is handled accurately.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases for various scenarios, including standard year transitions, leap years, and dates near the end or beginning of a year.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of one year from dates in different months, such as January, February, and December.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program capable of determining the date one year prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and adjustments, especially when dealing with leap years or dates that don't exist in certain months.",

The challenge lies in handling the transition between months and years correctly. In this case, subtracting 7 days from July 9, 1972, would bring us back to the previous month, June. Prolog can assist in managing these calculations and transitions through the use of date manipulation rules and functions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can accommodate operations like subtracting days and making adjustments to months and years.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from July 1 should result in June 30.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Develop logic to manage transitions between months when subtracting days. This includes accounting for varying numbers of days in different months and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases, such as February in leap years, should be considered to ensure accurate calculations.\n\n4. **Recursive Subtraction for Multiple Days:**\n   - Create a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (7 days) has been subtracted.\n   - This approach handles the subtraction of any number of days and manages transitions across multiple months or years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a function to check if a given year is a leap year.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Jane's scheduled appointments on Tuesday, July 9, 1972. Given that there are 24 hours in a day, the date 24 hours later would simply be the next day, which is Wednesday, July 10, 1972, represented as 07/10/1972 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to add one day to the given date, considering the transition from one day to the next within the same week. In Prolog, we can define rules for date manipulation, specifically for adding a single day, to handle this task effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule named `add_one_day(Date, NewDate)` that adds one day to the input date. If the current day (`DD`) is not the last day of the month, simply increment `DD` by 1.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_one_day` rule, include logic to handle the transition from the last day of the month to the first day of the following month. For example, if the input date is July 31, the new date should be August 1.\n   - Also, consider the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year. This will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the `add_one_day` rule correctly identifies and handles month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the correctness of the `add_one_day` rule for various scenarios, including normal day transitions, month-end transitions, and year-end transitions.\n   - Test cases should cover both leap and non-leap years to ensure accurate handling of February.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a simple Prolog program that can add one day to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and handling month and year boundaries, making it useful for scheduling and calendar-related applications.",

Prolog can be used to define rules for day subtraction and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for date and time, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(Hour, Minute, Second)`.\n   - Ensure that the date structure can handle operations like day subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from May 4, 2004, should result in May 3, 2004.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month or year when subtracting days. If the day is the first of the month, decrement the month (`MM`) and reset the day to the last day of the previous month.\n   - For instance, subtracting one day from January 1, 2000, should result in December 31, 1999.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check to determine if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Time Handling:**\n   - If time subtraction is also required, implement rules to handle time subtraction, considering cases where subtracting a minute or hour causes a transition to the previous hour or day.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day, month, and year transitions based on the input date.\n   - Ensure that the search mechanism correctly handles cases where multiple rules could apply, such as when subtracting days near month-end boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including those near month and year boundaries, to ensure correct transitions.\n   - Verify that the program handles both regular and leap years accurately when subtracting days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of determining the date \"yesterday\" based on a given date and time, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and correctly updating the date structure to reflect the new date.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from the given date and time: 3:02 PM on May 4, 2004. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from this date, considering any month or year transitions that may occur. The result will be the date and time one week earlier: 3:02 PM on April 27, 2004.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, subtracting a specific number of days (in this case, 7 days) from a given date. This involves handling month and year transitions, ensuring that the resulting date is accurate. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM)` to represent the date and time. This structure allows for handling both date and time components.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n   - For example, subtracting 7 days from May 4 should result in April 27, considering the transition from May to April.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. If the resulting month is less than the starting month, decrement the year and adjust the month accordingly.\n\n4. **Time Component Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the time component (hours and minutes) remains consistent during date subtraction. The time should not be affected by the date change.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the subtraction of multiple days, decrementing the count until it reaches zero. This will allow for subtracting any number of days accurately.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years when subtracting days.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is applied based on the number of days subtracted and the starting date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various date and time combinations, including transitions across months and years, to ensure accurate results.\n   - Verify that the time component remains consistent during date subtraction.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately calculate a date and time one week prior to a given input, considering all necessary transitions and adjustments.

In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to add hours and manage the day transition.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use separate structures for date and time, such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` and `time(HH, MM)`.\n   - Ensure these structures can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding hours and days.\n\n2. **Add Hours Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_hours(time(HH, MM), HoursToAdd, NewTime)` to add a given number of hours to a time. Use modular arithmetic to handle the hour overflow (e.g., 25 hours becomes 1 hour).\n\n3. **Day Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition from one day to the next when adding hours. If the resulting hour is less than 24, increment the day by one. If it is 24 or more, reset the hour to 0 and increment the day.\n\n4. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), DaysToAdd, NewDate)` to add days to a date, utilizing the `add_hours` function to handle the time component as well.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle month and year transitions when adding days. If the resulting day is greater than the number of days in the month, adjust the month and day accordingly, potentially incrementing the year.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle February during leap years when adding days or months.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for adding hours, days, and handling month and year transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various time and date additions, including cases that cross day, month, and year boundaries, to ensure accurate results.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date and time 24 hours later from a given input, handling time and date arithmetic, day transitions, and potential month and year adjustments.",

This can be translated to a date in the standard MM/DD/YYYY format as 03/02/1966, where 03 represents March (the third month), 02 represents the second day, and 1966 is the year.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to interpret the given description and convert it into the standard date format. The description provides the month as the ordinal number (third) and the day as the ordinal number (second) within that month. We need to translate these ordinal numbers into their corresponding numeric representations and then structure them in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n2. **Input Interpretation:**\n   - Interpret the given description to identify the month and day. In this case, \"the second day of the third month\" means MM = 03 (March) and DD = 02 (second day).\n\n3. **Ordinal Number Translation:**\n   - Implement logic to translate ordinal numbers (e.g., third, second) to their corresponding numeric values. This can be done using a mapping or a set of rules.\n\n4. **Year Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the year is correctly represented as a four-digit number. In this case, the year is given as 1966.\n\n5. **Date Construction:**\n   - Use the interpreted month, day, and year to construct the `date` structure. For example, `date(3, 2, 1966)` represents March 2, 1966.\n\n6. **Output Formatting:**\n   - Define a rule to format the `date` structure into the desired output format, MM/DD/YYYY. This involves concatenating the month, day, and year with slashes in between.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various descriptions, such as \"the first day of the first month,\" \"the tenth day of the twelfth month,\" and so on, to ensure the code correctly interprets different ordinal numbers and constructs the date accordingly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can interpret a date description with ordinal numbers and convert it into the standard MM/DD/YYYY format, taking into account the correct translation of ordinal numbers and proper date construction.",

Prolog can be used to handle this calculation by defining rules for date subtraction and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day and month subtraction.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is not the first of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`) by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. If the day is the first of the month, decrement the month (`MM`) and set the day to the last day of the previous month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from January 1 to the previous year's December. This will be important for subtracting days across year boundaries.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 in this case) have been subtracted.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for accurately handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date, such as identifying month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that involve crossing month boundaries, such as subtracting days from the beginning of a month or the end of February during a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is described as the second day of the third month of 1966. This translates to March 2, 1966. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) later from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month boundaries and potentially year boundaries if the addition spans a longer period. In this case, adding 7 days to March 2, 1966, will not cross any month or year boundaries. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments, and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day arithmetic operations, including increments and decrements.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should handle the transition to the next month.\n\n3. **Month Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the next month when the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. This rule should adjust `MM` and `DD` accordingly, considering different month lengths.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year when necessary, such as when incrementing December to January.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Adding Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the day increment rule to add a specified number of days to a date. This will handle cases where more than one day is added.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date. This will ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, adding days that span across months, and adding days that cross year boundaries.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one week from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as month-end and year-end adjustments. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, handling transitions, and using Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

If the current month is not January, decrement the month by one.\n   - For example, if the given date is `date(9, 7, 2003)`, subtracting one month should result in `date(8, 7, 2003)`.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting day is valid for the new month. If the original day is greater than the number of days in the new month, adjust the day to the last day of that month.\n   - For instance, if the original date is September 30, the date one month ago should be August 31.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January when subtracting months.

To find the date one year ago, we need to consider the number of days in September and potentially adjust for the leap year difference between 2003 and 2002.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a past date by subtracting one year from the current date. The challenge is to handle the transition between years, considering the varying number of days in each month, and accounting for leap years. In Prolog, we can solve this by defining rules for year subtraction, handling month transitions, and checking for leap years.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract One Year:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year (`YYYY`) by 1 and then adjusting the month and day as needed.\n\n3. **Handle Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting month and day are valid for the new year. If the original date falls after February 29 in a leap year, adjust the month and day accordingly for non-leap years.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling the day adjustment when transitioning from a leap year to a non-leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to the previous one, considering month and day adjustments and leap year differences.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to find and apply the correct rules for year subtraction, month and day adjustments, and leap year considerations.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various dates, such as September 7, February 28, and February 29, to ensure the logic handles different month lengths and leap year transitions correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year ago from a given date, considering year transitions, month and day adjustments, and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from the given date, September 7, 2003. To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add one day to this date, which means calculating September 8, 2003. This can be represented as 09/08/2003 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the given date by one day, taking into account potential month and year transitions. In this specific case, incrementing September 7 by one day will result in September 8, which is within the same month and year. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling day increments, and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day (`DD`) by 1, considering month boundaries. For example, if `MM` is 9 (September) and `DD` is 7, the next date should be September 8, 2003.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting day is beyond the number of days in the current month. If so, roll over to the next month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December to January of the next year if the day increment crosses the year boundary.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a function to check for leap years, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions. This will allow for incrementing by any number of days.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date. This will involve matching the current month and day to determine the appropriate rule to apply.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various scenarios, such as normal day increments, month-end transitions (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), year-end transitions (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and leap year transitions (e.g., February 28 to February 29).\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours later from a given date, handling both regular day increments and transitions between months and years.

Otherwise, if it is 1, decrement `MM` and set `DD` to the last day of the new month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to another when subtracting days. For example, if the date is January 1 and we subtract a day, the new date should be December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, ten days) by repeatedly applying the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that fall within that month.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the appropriate rules based on the current date structure during the day subtraction process, ensuring correct transitions between months and years.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Provide test cases that validate the correct date calculation when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, taking into account both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program capable of determining the date ten days prior to a given date, effectively handling transitions between days, months, and years, and considering the varying number of days in different months and leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from today's date, which is January 1, 1930. Subtracting one year involves changing the year component of the date by decrementing it by 1, resulting in the date of January 1, 1929.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one year from a given date. This involves decrementing the year component of the date while considering potential transitions from one month to another, especially when moving from January to December. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this year subtraction accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like year subtraction.\n\n2. **Year Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one year from a given date by decrementing the year component (`YYYY`). If the resulting year is a leap year and the date falls within February, adjust the date to the valid range for that month.\n\n3. **Month and Day Adjustments:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from one month to another when subtracting a year. For example, if today is January 1, 1930, subtracting one year should result in December 31, 1929, as December has only 31 days.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid after subtracting a year. If the resulting date is in a month with fewer days, adjust the day component to the last valid day of that month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling the day adjustment in February during year subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one year to another, considering potential month and day adjustments.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for year subtraction based on the current date, including month and day adjustments.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that validate the year subtraction function for various dates, including transitions between months and handling leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one year prior to a given date, considering month and day adjustments during the year subtraction process. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to handle different scenarios effectively.",

        "question": "Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. Since there is no December 32, today is January 1, 1930, and one week ago from today would be exactly one week back from this date. Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date, considering month and year transitions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next when subtracting days. This requires understanding how to manage the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to navigate these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering month transitions. If `DD` is not the first day of the month, decrement `DD` by 1. Otherwise, decrement `MM` by 1, and if `MM` becomes 0, decrement `YYYY` by 1, then update `MM` accordingly.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Create logic to manage the transition from December to January when subtracting days. If `MM` is 1 (January) and `DD` needs to be decremented, set `MM` to 12 (December) of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle February, especially when subtracting days that involve February 29.\n\n5. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days).

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today's date, given that yesterday was December 31, 1929. Since today is the day after December 31, it is January 1, 1930. One week from today would be January 8, 1930. This can be represented as 01/08/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) ahead of the given date, considering the transition from December to January and handling the new year change. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations for adding days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. If `DD` is the last day of the month, the rule should handle the transition to the next month.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include rules to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if the date is December 31, incrementing by one day should result in January 1 of the next year.\n\n4. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses the increment rule to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` with each iteration until `Days` reaches 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date transitions based on the current date.

For example, if adding two days to November 30 results in December.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if adding days crosses the end of December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during date additions.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules within the `add_days` function to repeatedly add a single day until the specified number of days is reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date addition based on the current date and the number of days to add.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that validate the `add_days` function for various scenarios, including adding days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries, while also considering leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute today's date based on the given information, handling date arithmetic and month transitions effectively.",

Therefore, the date one month ago would be October 25, 1933, represented as 10/25/1933 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of one month from a given date, considering potential transitions between months and years.

        "question": "In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date the day after US Thanksgiving in 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001, so the date tomorrow would be November 23, 2001, represented as 11/23/2001 in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of US Thanksgiving for the year 2001 and then add one day to that date. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday of November) and performing a simple date increment operation. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November:\n     - Find the first day of November for the given year.\n     - Calculate the first Thursday of that month.\n     - Add 3 weeks (21 days) to get to the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Add One Day:**\n   - Implement a rule to add one day to a given date. This will involve checking if the current day (`DD`) is the last day of the month and, if so, rolling over to the first day of the next month.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Handle the transition between months correctly. If adding one day results in a date beyond the maximum days in the current month, update the month and day accordingly.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when calculating Thanksgiving or adding days around that period.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for various years to ensure the Thanksgiving date is calculated correctly and the addition of one day works across different scenarios, including month and year transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a SWI-Prolog program that can determine the date the day after US Thanksgiving for any given year, handling date arithmetic and considering month and year transitions. This will involve defining rules for date manipulation and leveraging Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "question": "In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday from the US Thanksgiving in 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, so yesterday would be November 21, 2001, which can be represented as 11/21/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one day prior to the US Thanksgiving in 2001. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating the Thanksgiving date and then performing a simple day subtraction, taking into account any adjustments needed for the month or year. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day subtraction.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Implement a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November. Use date manipulation functions to find the first Thursday in November and then add three weeks to reach the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Day Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If the day is not the first day of the month, simply decrement the day (`DD`).\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition from the first day of the month to the last day of the previous month. For example, if the date is December 1, moving one day back should result in November 30.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Thanksgiving and the day subtraction. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in applying the correct rules based on the input year and handling exceptions like leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the appropriate rules for day subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for day subtraction across month and year boundaries, including both regular and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one day before Thanksgiving for any given year, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules accurately.",

        "question": "In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date ten days prior to the US Thanksgiving in 2001. Thanksgiving in the US falls on the fourth Thursday of November. In the year 2001, this date was November 22. Therefore, to find the date ten days before Thanksgiving, we need to calculate the date ten days earlier than November 22, 2001.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting ten days from the date of Thanksgiving. This involves understanding the concept of negative day values and handling month and year transitions correctly. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to calculate the desired date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic, including day subtraction.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Implement a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November. Use date manipulation functions to find the first Thursday in November and then add three weeks to obtain the fourth Thursday (Thanksgiving).\n\n3. **Day Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. If the resulting day is negative, subtract it from the last day of the previous month and adjust the month accordingly.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, subtracting ten days from November 22 may result in a date in early November or even late October, depending on the starting day.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which will be important for accurately handling the number of days in February during day subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of the date a certain number of days ago. This will involve repeatedly subtracting a single day until the desired number of days has been reached.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules for day subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that validate the correct date calculation for Thanksgiving in various years and the accurate handling of day subtraction across month and year boundaries, taking leap years into account.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a SWI-Prolog program that can determine the date ten days before Thanksgiving for any given year, handling date arithmetic, month and year transitions, and leap years effectively.",

Thanksgiving in the US falls on the fourth Thursday of November. In the year 2001, this date was November 22, so today is November 22, 2001. To find the date one week ago, we need to calculate seven days prior to this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, specifically subtracting seven days from a given date. This involves understanding the concept of US Thanksgiving and its relation to the current date, as well as handling the transition between days, months, and years when subtracting days.

        "question": "In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today's date, which is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. This means that today's date is November 22, 2001, as 2001 has November starting on a Thursday. The date 24 hours later would be November 23, 2001, which can be represented as 11/23/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of US Thanksgiving for a given year and then add one day to it. This involves understanding the logic behind determining the date of Thanksgiving and then performing a simple date increment operation. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules for calculating Thanksgiving and adding days to a date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day and month increments.\n\n2. **Calculate Thanksgiving Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule `thanksgiving(YYYY, Date)` that calculates the date of US Thanksgiving for a given year. This rule should consider that Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\n3. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to calculate the date 24 hours later. This rule should handle the transition to the next day, including month and year rollovers if needed.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `increment_day` rule, include logic to check if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, set the day to 1 and increment the month. If the month is December, also increment the year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of 24 hours, which is equivalent to incrementing the day by one.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date, such as transitioning to the next month or year if needed.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the correctness of the `thanksgiving` rule for different years, including leap years. Also, test the `increment_day` rule for various scenarios, such as month-end and year-end transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date 24 hours later from US Thanksgiving for a given year, handling date arithmetic and transitions correctly.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date today, given that a meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, October 16, 1924. This problem involves deductive reasoning to calculate the date prior to a given date. Since the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, today's date is one day before October 16, 1924, which is October 15, 1924. This date can be formatted as 10/15/1924 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one day before the given date, considering month and year boundaries. In this case, the transition is within the same month, so we don't need to worry about crossing into a new month or year. The solution involves subtracting one day from the given date, which can be achieved through date arithmetic in Prolog.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle date subtraction operations.\n\n2. **Subtract One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_one_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to subtract one day from the given date. If `DD` is not 1, then decrement it by 1. If `DD` is 1, then decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the previous month.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to determine the number of days in each month to correctly handle transitions between months. For example, if `MM` is 10 (October) and `DD` is 1, then `MM` becomes 9 (September), and `DD` should be set to 30.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle transitions between years, which is not necessary for this specific case but would be useful for general date subtraction.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check for leap years, which is crucial for accurately handling the number of days in February during date subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to subtract multiple days if needed, though in this case, we only need to subtract one day.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date subtraction based on the current date structure.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the correct date subtraction, including month-end transitions and leap years.

        "question": "Today's meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, 10/16/1924. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date yesterday based on the information that a meeting is rescheduled to 11 am tomorrow, which is October 16, 1924. Given that tomorrow is October 16, 1924, yesterday would be two days before that, which is October 14, 1924. So, the date yesterday was 10/14/1924 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is two days before the given date. This involves subtracting two days from the \"tomorrow\" date while handling month and year transitions correctly. In this case, the calculation does not involve any month or year transitions, but the plan should still consider these cases for a general solution. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic, handling month lengths, and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day, month, and year arithmetic.\n\n2. **Date Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This rule should handle normal day subtraction and month/year transitions correctly.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month if the day subtraction results in a negative day value. For example, if today is May 1 and we subtract 3 days, the result should be April 28.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Handle the transition to the previous year if the month subtraction reaches January. For example, subtracting 2 months from January 1 should result in the previous year's December date.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a predicate to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February during subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to subtract a single day repeatedly until the desired number of days is reached. This will ensure that the correct transitions are applied during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rule for date subtraction based on the current date structure and the number of days to subtract.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the correctness of the `subtract_days` rule for various scenarios, including normal day subtraction, month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date \"yesterday\" based on a given \"tomorrow\" date, considering potential month and year transitions and handling leap years.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one year ago from today's date, which is October 16, 1924. To calculate the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current year, 1924, resulting in the year 1923. Then, we maintain the same month and day, resulting in a final date of October 16, 1923, or 10/16/1923 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting one year from a given date while ensuring that the month and day remain intact. The key is to handle the transition between years correctly. In this case, subtracting one year does not affect the month or day, so the resulting date is within the same month and day of the previous year. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle year subtraction and manage the month and day accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations involving year subtraction.\n\n2. **Subtract Year Function:**\n   - Implement a function `subtract_year(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that subtracts one year from the given date. If `YYYY` is not a leap year and `MM` is February with `DD` being 29, set `DD` to 28 for the previous year.\n\n3. **Maintain Month and Day:**\n   - Within the `subtract_year` function, ensure that the `MM` and `DD` values remain the same as in the original date. This is because, in this case, the month and day do not change when subtracting a year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year.

This calculation will lead us to the date October 9, 1924, which can be formatted as 10/09/1924 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days from a given date, considering the transitions between months and years. In this case, since we are subtracting seven days from October 16, there is no need to account for month or year transitions, as October has 31 days. However, in general, we need to account for these transitions when subtracting days. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, handling month and year changes accordingly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day subtraction within the same month and transitions between months and years.\n\n2. **Subtract Day Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a single day from the given date. If `DD` is not 1 (the first day of the month), simply decrement `DD` by 1.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Create a rule to handle the transition to the previous month if `DD` is 1. In this case, decrement `MM` by 1 and set `DD` to the last day of the new month. Consider the varying number of days in different months.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Implement a rule to handle the transition to the previous year if the current month is January (`MM` is 1).

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from a given date, which is October 16, 1924, at 11 am. Adding 24 hours to this date and time will result in the same time on the following day, which is October 17, 1924, at 11 am. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is 10/17/1924 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding 24 hours to a given date and time while ensuring that the resulting date is correct, considering potential month and year transitions. In this case, the addition of 24 hours does not trigger any special conditions, and the date rolls over to the next day within the same month and year. The key is to handle the increment of the day correctly while accounting for month boundaries. In Prolog, we can define rules for date arithmetic, including handling month-end transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Time Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `datetime(MM, DD, YYYY, HH, MM)` to represent dates and times in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling time increments and date transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Time Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the time by 24 hours. This involves adding 24 to the hours (`HH`) and handling the carry-over to minutes and hours if needed.\n\n3. **Handling Day Transition:**\n   - Define a rule to handle the transition to the next day if the resulting hours exceed 23:59 (or 11:59 PM). This rule should increment the day (`DD`) by 1 and reset the hours and minutes to 0.\n\n4. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement rules to handle transitions between months and years if the day increment causes the date to exceed the number of days in the current month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define rules that handle time increments and date transitions, ensuring that the correct rules are applied based on the current date and time.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select and apply the appropriate rules for time and date adjustments based on the input.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including simple time increments, day transitions, month transitions, and year transitions, ensuring that the code handles each case correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date and time 24 hours later from a given input, considering potential transitions and adjustments due to month and year boundaries.",

If today is the last day of January, then yesterday would be one day prior, which is January 30, 2012, represented as 01/30/2012 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date one day before a given date, which is a simple subtraction of one day. However, we must consider the transition between months and years, especially when dealing with the last day of a month. In this case, since we are on the last day of January, subtracting one day should result in remaining within the same month, but the day should be decremented to the last day of that month.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle day subtraction and month transitions.\n\n2. **Day Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one day from a given date. If `DD` is not 1 (the first day of the month), simply decrement `DD` to get the previous day.\n\n3. **Handling Last Day of the Month:**\n   - Implement a special case within the day subtraction rule to handle the transition from the last day of a month to the previous day. If `DD` is 1, then the previous day is the last day of the previous month. Decrement `DD` to the maximum for that month and decrement `MM` by 1.\n\n4. **Month Transition Logic:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition between months when subtracting days. If the month is January (represented as 1) and a day is subtracted, then the new month should be December (represented as 12) in the previous year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly relevant to this specific problem, consider adding a leap year check for more comprehensive date handling.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine today's date given that it was September 1, 2021, a week ago. To find today's date, we need to add seven days to September 1, 2021. This calculation will lead us to the date September 8, 2021, which can be represented as 09/08/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating today's date based on a known date in the past and a specified time interval (one week). Adding seven days to the given date requires understanding how dates progress, including handling month and year transitions if necessary. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform this calculation accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations that involve adding days to a date.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. If adding days causes the date to exceed the maximum days in the current month, the function should roll over to the next month or year as needed.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months. If adding days results in a date beyond the last day of the current month, increment the month or year accordingly.\n   - Special handling is needed for December to January transitions, ensuring the year is incremented correctly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years when adding days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days. For example, to add seven days, recursively call `add_days` with smaller increments until the total number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct path for month and year transitions when adding days.

If the current month is not January, decrement the month value by one. If the current month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December.\n\n3. **Adjusting Day Value:**\n   - When subtracting a month, the day value may need adjustment.

        "question": "Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary based on their marriage date of January 2, 1958. To find the date of their 5-year anniversary, we need to calculate the date that is exactly five years after their wedding date. This involves adding five years to the year component of the date and checking if any adjustments are needed for the month and day components.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem requires us to perform date arithmetic, specifically adding five years to a given date. In SWI-Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this task. We need to consider the possibility of leap years and the varying number of days in different months. The plan should include steps to handle these scenarios and ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding years.\n\n2. **Add Years Function:**\n   - Write a function `add_years(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Years, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of years to a given date.\n   - This function should handle cases where the addition of years causes a transition to a different month or day within the same month.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Day Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the resulting month and day are valid for the new year. If the calculated date falls on a leap day (February 29) in a non-leap year, adjust the date to February 28.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February dates correctly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple years. For example, to add five years, recursively call the `add_years` function five times, each time adding one year.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct rules to apply based on the current date and the number of years being added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding years in different scenarios, such as adding five years to January 2, 1958, and verifying that the result is January 2, 1963.\n   - Test cases should also cover transitions between months and years, as well as leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date of Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, taking into account potential date adjustments due to leap years and varying month lengths. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic, handling date transitions, and using Prolog's search capabilities to apply these rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month ago from Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, which is January 2, 1963. Calculating one month prior to this date involves subtracting a month from the anniversary date, considering the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another. Given that their anniversary is on January 2nd, one month ago would fall into the month of December of the same year, 1963.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to its preceding month, and in this case, it involves staying within the same year. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to manage this transition effectively, ensuring that the month and day are adjusted correctly when moving backward in time.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Utilize a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Handling Month Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is not January, simply decrement the month. However, if the month is January, then set the new month to December of the previous year.\n\n3. **Day Adjustment:**\n   - Consider the number of days in the resulting month and adjust the day accordingly. For example, if the original date is January 31, the resulting date in the previous month should be December 31 of the previous year.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February during month subtraction.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the transition from one month to another, considering potential year transitions and day adjustments.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct month transition based on the current month.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after Jane and John's 5-year wedding anniversary, which was on January 2, 1958. Given that today is their anniversary, the date 24 hours later would be January 3, 1963, represented as 01/03/1963 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 24 hours or one day after their wedding anniversary, which occurs every year on the same date. This involves adding one day to the anniversary date and ensuring that the year is updated correctly. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle this calculation.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for adding days and years.\n\n2. **Add One Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule `add_one_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to add one day to a given date. If `DD` is not the last day of the month, simply increment it. Otherwise, set `DD` to 1 and increment `MM` unless it is already December, in which case increment `YYYY` and set `MM` to January.\n\n3. **Handling Year Increments:**\n   - Include logic to handle the case where adding one day results in a date in the next year. This will be important for correctly updating the year component of the date.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, which can be useful for more complex date calculations.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a helper predicate to check if a given year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct date transitions are applied based on the input date, especially when crossing month and year boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_one_day` rule with various dates, including month-end and year-end scenarios, to ensure it correctly handles all cases, such as adding one day to January 31 or December 31.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate dates a certain number of days after a given date, taking into account month and year transitions, and handling leap years correctly.

This problem involves calculating the number of days that have passed since May 9, 2017, and then subtracting one day to find the date yesterday. The result will be May 31, 2017.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform date arithmetic, including adding days to a given date and then subtracting one day to find the previous date. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to handle date addition and subtraction, taking into account month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days.\n\n2. **Days Elapsed Calculation:**\n   - Write a function `days_elapsed(StartDate, EndDate, Days)` that calculates the number of days between two dates. This function will be useful for finding how many days have passed since May 9, 2017.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This will be used to calculate the date after a certain number of days have passed.\n\n4. **Subtract Days Function:**\n   - Create a function `subtract_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This will be used to find the date yesterday.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - In the `add_days` and `subtract_days` functions, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. For example, if adding days causes the month to exceed its maximum number of days, increment the month or year accordingly.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when performing date arithmetic.\n\n7. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the addition and subtraction of days, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n8. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transitions are applied based on the input date and the number of days added or subtracted.\n\n9. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various scenarios, including adding and subtracting days within the same month, across month boundaries, and across year boundaries.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days prior to the day Jane ran out of eggs. Given that she bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one egg per day, she would have run out of eggs 40 days later, which is June 18, 2017. Therefore, the date 10 days ago from June 18, 2017, would be June 8, 2017, represented as 06/08/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is 10 days before the date when Jane ran out of eggs. This involves two steps: first, calculating the date when Jane ran out of eggs, and second, subtracting 10 days from that date. The challenge lies in correctly handling the addition and subtraction of days, months, and potentially years. In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days and months.\n\n2. **Egg Consumption Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date when Jane ran out of eggs based on the given information. This involves adding 40 days to the date when she bought the eggs (May 9, 2017).\n\n3. **Date Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a function to subtract 10 days from a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions correctly (e.g., subtracting 10 days from January 1 should result in December 22 of the previous year).\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Include specific rules to manage transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, subtracting days from the end of a month should correctly transition to the previous month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Add a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the addition and subtraction of days, considering month and year transitions. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in selecting the correct rules based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various egg consumption rates and starting dates to ensure the egg depletion date is calculated correctly. Also, test the date subtraction function across different scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date a certain number of days before a significant event, in this case, Jane running out of eggs.

In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding and subtracting days and months.\n\n2. **Calculate Egg Expiration Date:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date when Jane ran out of eggs. Start with the given date of May 9, 2017, and add 40 days to it using a loop or recursion.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, decrement the year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month, taking care to adjust the day if needed.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains valid when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day (e.g., moving from January 31 to February), adjust the day to the last day of the resulting month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during month subtraction.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to handle the calculation of the egg expiration date and the subsequent month subtraction. Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and search capabilities will help in applying the correct rules based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various starting dates and different numbers of eggs to ensure the egg expiration date is calculated correctly. Also, verify that the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including month-end and year-end transitions, as well as leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before Jane ran out of eggs, taking into account both the initial calculation and the month subtraction. This will involve a combination of date arithmetic and handling date transitions and special cases.",

If adding days causes a month overflow, increment the month and adjust the day accordingly. If the month overflows (e.g., from December to January), increment the year and reset the month.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle the varying number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure that the correct date transitions are applied when adding or subtracting days, especially when crossing month or year boundaries.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `days_since_purchase` function with various dates to ensure accurate calculations.\n   - Test the `add_days` function with different numbers of days and dates near month and year transitions to verify correct behavior.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from today, considering the given egg-eating scenario. This involves date arithmetic, handling date transitions, and leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours after the day Jane ran out of eggs, given that she bought 40 eggs on May 9, 2017, and ate one per day. Since she ate one egg per day, she would have run out of eggs 40 days after May 9, 2017, which would be June 18, 2017. Therefore, the date 24 hours later would be June 19, 2017, or 06/19/2017 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a fixed number of days passing. We need to add 40 days to the initial date of May 9, 2017, and then add another 24 hours (1 day) to find the final date. In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for date arithmetic, including adding days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date.\n   - This function should handle transitions between months and years correctly.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to check if adding a day would exceed the number of days in the current month. If so, increment the month and reset the day to 1.\n   - Special handling is needed for December to January transitions, where the year should also increment.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February during leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that adds one day at a time until the total number of days is reached.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct transition (incrementing day, month, or year) based on the current date and the number of days added.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the `add_days` function with various scenarios, including transitions between months, transitions between years, and leap years. For example, adding 40 days to May 9, 2017, should result in June 18, 2017.\n\n8. **Final Date Calculation:**\n   - Use the `add_days` function to add 40 days to May 9, 2017, to find the date Jane ran out of eggs.\n   - Then, add another 24 hours (1 day) to find the date 24 hours later.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date 24 hours after Jane ran out of eggs, considering all necessary date transitions and handling leap years.",

The first quarter of a year includes the months of January, February, and March, and it ends on March 31. Therefore, today is March 31, 2008, and the date yesterday would be March 30, 2008, which can be represented as 03/30/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves deducting that today is the last day of a given quarter and then calculating the date of the previous day. To solve this, we need to understand the concept of quarters in a year and their corresponding dates. The last day of the first quarter is always March 31, so we can use this information to determine today's date. Then, we can simply subtract one day to find the date of yesterday.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle date arithmetic.\n\n2. **Quarters Definition:**\n   - Implement a rule or predicate that defines the last day of each quarter. For example, `last_day_of_quarter(1, date(3, 31, YYYY))` would represent that the last day of the first quarter is March 31 for any year `YYYY`.\n\n3. **Today's Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule that determines today's date based on the given information. In this case, it would be a fact or rule stating that today is the last day of the first quarter of 2008, so `today(date(3, 31, 2008))`.\n\n4. **Subtract One Day:**\n   - Define a rule `subtract_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` to calculate the previous day's date. This rule should handle the transition between months and years when necessary.\n\n5. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `subtract_day` rule, include logic to check if `DD` is 1. If so, decrement `MM` and set `DD` to the last day of the previous month. If `MM` becomes 0, then also decrement `YYYY` and reset `MM` and `DD` accordingly.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date transitions based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with various dates, including quarter-end dates, month-end dates, and leap year dates, to ensure accurate results.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can deduce the date of yesterday based on the understanding of quarters and their corresponding dates, while also handling date arithmetic and transitions effectively.",

        "question": "Today is the last day of the first quarter of 2008. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago from today, which is the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The last day of the first quarter means it is either March 31 or, during a leap year, it could be April 1. For this specific case, we can assume it is March 31, 2008, without considering leap years. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting 10 days from a given date, which may require handling a transition between months. In this case, subtracting 10 days from March 31 would bring us back to March 21, 2008. The challenge is to define rules that handle the subtraction of days, especially when crossing month boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure this structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Implement a rule that subtracts a single day from a given date. If `DD` is 1, then the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Develop logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days. For example, if we subtract enough days to go from March to February, we need to adjust for the number of days in February, considering leap years.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Create a recursive rule that repeatedly applies the single-day subtraction rule until the desired number of days (10 in this case) has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling the number of days in February during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the correct rules for day and month transitions based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month boundaries, such as subtracting days from March 31 or April 1. Also, include test cases for leap years to ensure that February is handled correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 10 days ago from a given date, considering potential transitions between days, months, and years.

The last day of the first quarter of a year is always March 31, so today's date is March 31, 2008. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from this date.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves subtracting days from a given date, considering the transition between months and years. Since March has 31 days, subtracting 7 days will take us back to the same month, March, but a week earlier.

If the day is the first of the month, then the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and the month should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Develop logic to handle transitions between months and years when subtracting days.

This rule should increment `MM` and reset `DD` to 1.\n\n4. **Year Transition Rule:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year when `MM` exceeds 12 (December). This rule should increment `YYYY` by 1 and reset `MM` and `DD` to January 1.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be important for correctly handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Utilize recursive rules to increment days, considering month and year transitions. This will ensure that the date is correctly updated even for larger increments.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules based on the current date, such as incrementing the day, transitioning to the next month, or transitioning to the next year.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover various scenarios, including simple day increments, month transitions, year transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from March 31 to April 1, from December 31 to January 1, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date 24 hours later from a given date, considering month and year transitions, and handling leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's pattern matching to apply those rules effectively.",

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date of the first Monday of 2019, given that the first day of the year was a Tuesday. To solve this, we need to calculate how many days after the first of the year it is until we reach a Monday. Since Tuesday is one day after Monday, the first Monday of the year would be 6 days after the 1st of January. Therefore, the date today is January 7, 2019, or 01/07/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date based on the day of the week and a specific year. We need to determine the number of days between the first day of the year and the first occurrence of a specific day of the week (Monday in this case). This requires understanding the pattern of days in a week and their correspondence to dates. In Prolog, we can use rules and recursion to calculate the desired date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Day of the Week Enumeration:**\n   - Represent days of the week as an enumeration, such as `monday, tuesday`, etc.\n   - Ensure that the enumeration aligns with the starting day of the week (usually Monday).\n\n2. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n\n3. **Calculate Days to Target Day:**\n   - Write a function `days_to_target_day(FirstDay, TargetDay, Days)` that calculates the number of days from `FirstDay` to the next occurrence of `TargetDay`.\n   - For example, `days_to_target_day(tuesday, monday, Days)` should yield `Days` as 6.\n\n4. **Add Days to Date:**\n   - Create a function `add_days_to_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that adds `Days` to a given date. This function should handle month and year transitions correctly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the addition of multiple days, considering month and year boundaries.\n\n6. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check for leap years, which will be important for accurate date calculations in February.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the correct rules for date transitions based on the current date and the target day of the week.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the functions with various day of the week transitions, month transitions, and year transitions. For example, adding 7 days to December 30 should yield January 6 of the next year.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date of the first Monday (or any other specified day) of a given year, considering the starting day of the week and handling date transitions correctly.",

        "question": "The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days prior to the first Monday of 2019, given that the first day of the year was a Tuesday. To solve this, we can deduce that the first Monday occurred five days after the first day of the year (since Tuesday is one day after Monday). Therefore, the first Monday was January 7, 2019. Counting back 10 days from this date, we arrive at December 28, 2018, which is the correct answer in MM/DD/YYYY format: 12/28/2018.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves understanding the relationship between days of the week and specific dates. The key is to recognize that the first Monday of 2019 occurred five days after the first day of the year, which was a Tuesday. From there, we need to count back 10 days, crossing the boundary from January to December of the previous year. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to calculate the target date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Weekday Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Use a separate structure or enumeration to represent weekdays (e.g., `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.).\n\n2. **Calculate First Monday of 2019:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the first Monday of a given year. This involves finding the first day of January and then counting forward until the first Monday.\n\n3. **Date Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Implement a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. This will involve decrementing the day (`DD`) and handling month and year transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - When subtracting days, handle the transition from one month to the previous one, and from one year to the previous one if necessary. For example, subtracting 10 days from January 7 may require adjusting the month to December and the year to 2018.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check for leap years, which is important for correctly handling February when subtracting days.\n\n6. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define rules for date subtraction and finding the first Monday of a year.\n   - Employ Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to select the appropriate rule based on the input date and the number of days to subtract.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios, including subtracting days across month and year boundaries, and handling leap years. For example, test subtracting 10 days from January 7, 2019, and ensure it yields December 28, 2018.\n\n8. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and the number of days to subtract, returning the resulting date. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs and provides clear error messages.\n\nBy following this plan, the SWI-Prolog program will be able to determine the date 10 days prior to the first Monday of 2019, taking into account weekday calculations, date manipulation, and transitions across month and year boundaries.",

If the month is January, adjust the year to the previous year and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component is adjusted correctly when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the original day (e.g., moving from January 31 to February), change the day to the last day of the resulting month.\n\n5. **Day of the Week Identification:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s built-in functions or external libraries to identify the day of the week for a given date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is the first Monday of 2019. If the first day of 2019 (January 1) was a Tuesday, then today, the first Monday, is January 7, 2019. One week from today would be January 14, 2019, which can be represented as 01/14/2019 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one week (seven days) from today's date. This involves understanding the concept of days of the week, recognizing patterns in dates, and performing date arithmetic. In Prolog, we can use rules and date manipulation functions to calculate the desired date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY, DayOfWeek)` to represent dates, where `DayOfWeek` is an atom representing the day of the week (e.g., 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc.).\n   - Ensure the structure can handle arithmetic operations for adding days.\n\n2. **Calculate First Monday:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of the first Monday of a given year. This involves finding the first day of January and then checking if it is a Monday. If not, increment the day until a Monday is found.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Implement a function `add_days(Date, Days, NewDate)` that adds a specified number of days to a given date. This function will handle day, month, and year increments correctly.\n\n4. **Handle Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Within the `add_days` function, include logic to handle transitions between months and years. If the resulting day is beyond the number of days in the current month, roll over to the next month or year as needed.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a given year is a leap year, which will impact the number of days in February during that year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the addition of days, considering month and year transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to apply the correct rules for date manipulation based on the current date and the number of days to add.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for adding days within the same month, across different months, and across year transitions. Test cases should also cover leap years to ensure February is handled correctly.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can calculate the date one week from today, given that today is the first Monday of 2019.
