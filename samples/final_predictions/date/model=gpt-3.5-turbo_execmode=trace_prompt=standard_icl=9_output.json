                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 24 hours later from today, given that today is April 19, 1969. Since there are no special conditions like a month or year transition, the date 24 hours later would simply be April 20, 1969. This can be represented as 04/20/1969 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a straightforward increment of the day by one within the same month and year. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary, which is not a concern in this specific case since April has 30 days. In Prolog, we can handle this with a simple rule that increments the day and checks for month boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 4 (April) and `DD` is 19, the next date should be April 20, 1969.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Although not needed for this specific date, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a general rule for handling the transition to the next year if the month exceeds December.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in general cases, though it is not needed for this specific date.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month, transitions between months, and transitions between years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling both simple and complex date transitions."

Calculating one week ago involves subtracting seven days from the current date. Since December 31 is the last day of the year, subtracting seven days means we need to go back into the previous month, December, and find the date that corresponds to seven days before December 31.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting days. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering the transition between months. For example, if `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve recursive logic and careful consideration of month and year boundaries."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date 10 days ago, given that a concert originally scheduled for June 1, 1943, was delayed by one day, making today June 2, 1943. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 10 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a single day from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting one day from June 1, 1943, should result in May 31, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date 10 days ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 10 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation."

If it was September 1, 2021, a week ago, then today is September 8, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow would be September 9, 2021, which can be represented as 09/09/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known past date and a specified interval (one week). After determining today's date, the task is to compute the date of the following day. This requires understanding of date progression including handling the end of months. In Prolog, this can be implemented by defining rules for date incrementation and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function will handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handle Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if a day is the last day of its month, and if so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n   - Special cases for December (transition to a new year) should be handled separately.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date a week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from September 30 to October 1), transitions between years (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), and during leap years for February.\n\n8. **Date Calculation for Tomorrow:**\n   - Given the date a week ago, use the recursive function to calculate today's date by adding 7 days.\n   - Then, use the `increment_date` function to find tomorrow's date from today's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the date a week ago, handling month and year transitions, and considering leap years. This will involve defining rules for date arithmetic and using Prolog's search and pattern matching capabilities to apply these rules correctly."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that yesterday was April 30, 2021. From this information, we can deduce that today is May 1, 2021. Therefore, the date tomorrow will be May 2, 2021. This date can be formatted as 05/02/2021 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition between the end of one month and the beginning of another. Since April has 30 days, the day after April 30 is May 1. The next day, which is the target of our query, is May 2. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and handling the increment of the day and month values appropriately. In Prolog, we can achieve this by defining rules that manage these transitions based on the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be flexible enough to handle changes in day, month, and year.\n\n2. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Define a rule that checks if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, it should set the day to 1 and increment the month. Special handling is needed for December, where the year also needs to be incremented.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule for normal day increments where the day is not the last of the month. This rule simply increments the day by one.\n\n4. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Implement a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. This rule should adjust the end date of February to 29 days if the year is a leap year.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s recursive capabilities to define a rule that calculates tomorrow\u2019s date by checking today\u2019s date and applying the appropriate transition (end of month, normal increment).\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to select the correct rule based on the input date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Develop test cases that cover different scenarios including month-end transitions, year-end transitions, and leap years. For example, test the transition from April 30 to May 1, from February 28 to March 1 in a non-leap year, and from February 28 to February 29 in a leap year.\n\n7. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input a date and receive the date of the following day. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date of tomorrow based on the input of today\u2019s date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one month prior to the US Thanksgiving in 2001. Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001. Therefore, one month before this date would be October 22, 2001, which can be represented as 10/22/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one month prior to a given date. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating dates based on the US Thanksgiving holiday and then performing a simple month subtraction, taking care to adjust the year if necessary (e.g., if the month is January). In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November. Use date manipulation functions to find the first day of November of the given year, then calculate the first Thursday, and finally add three weeks to get the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day (e.g., moving from March 31 to February), adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Thanksgiving and the month subtraction. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in matching the correct rules based on the input year and handling exceptions like leap years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months or calculating dates.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years to ensure the Thanksgiving date is calculated correctly and the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including end-of-year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before Thanksgiving for any given year, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively."

Since December has only 31 days, today cannot be December 32, 1929. Therefore, the correct date today is January 1, 1930, represented as 01/01/1930 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one year to the next, which occurs after December 31. The key is to recognize that the date rolls over to January 1 of the following year. This requires understanding both month-day boundaries and year transitions. In Prolog, we can use rules and pattern matching to correctly identify when the transition to a new month and year should occur.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage both day and month increments as well as year transitions.\n\n2. **Base Case for Year Transition:**\n   - Write a base case that handles the transition from December 31 to January 1. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 31, the next date should change the month to January (`MM` becomes 1), the day to 1, and increment the year (`YYYY` increases by 1).\n\n3. **Normal Case:**\n   - Write a rule that simply increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month and handles month transitions correctly.\n\n4. **Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between different months, recognizing that different months have different numbers of days (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days, etc.).\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to determine if the year is a leap year to correctly handle February dates.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle day, month, and year transitions, making sure that the correct logic is applied depending on the date structure.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Leverage Prolog\u2019s built-in search to correctly apply rules and pattern matching, ensuring the correct date is selected when moving from one day to the next.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the correct transition from December 31 to January 1 across different years, including both non-leap and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately determines the date \"today\" based on the input, handling both regular and boundary cases like year transitions."

                "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that the year 2015 is coming in 36 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours from now would be 1 day and 12 hours into the future, which means it will be January 1, 2015, in 12 hours. Therefore, today is December 30, 2014. One week from today would be January 6, 2015.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from a given date. This involves understanding how days add up over month and year boundaries. In this case, the calculation spans over the new year transition from December to January. Prolog can be used to handle these transitions by defining rules for date arithmetic, including handling different month lengths and year changes.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the next day. If `DD` is the last day of `MM`, then `MM` should increment, and `DD` should reset to 1. If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should decrement `Days` each time until `Days` is 0, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to December 30, 2014, should result in January 6, 2015.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute a date some days ahead, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years. This will be particularly useful for applications needing date manipulation and calculation."

Since months have varying numbers of days, it is important to account for different month lengths and potential year changes. In Prolog, we can create rules to handle these transitions and calculate the date one month ago accurately.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle month decrements and year adjustments.\n\n2. **Decrement Month Function:**\n   - Write a rule to decrement the month by 1 while keeping the day and year constant. For example, if the current date is November 12, 2019, decrementing the month should result in October 12, 2019.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months, considering the varying number of days in each month.

In Prolog, we can handle this by defining rules for date incrementation and ensuring that the month and year are adjusted correctly.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the date after adding 7 days to the given date.\n   - This function should handle month-end transitions and adjust the year if necessary.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if adding 7 days will transition to the next month. If so, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special consideration should be given to the end of the year transition.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a function to check if a year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years when adding days.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For adding 7 days, the function should increment the day while considering month and year transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine the correct rules for incrementing the date based on the current date structure.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the function correctly calculates the date one week from the given date, considering different scenarios like month-end transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively.

Understanding the number of days in each month and managing day decrements are essential for accurate date calculations. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts one day from a given date.

Given that they married on January 2, 1958, their golden anniversary falls on January 2, 2008. To find the date one month prior to this anniversary, we need to go back to December 2, 2007, as December is the month before January.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another while considering the specific date of the golden anniversary. Since we are moving back one month, it is important to account for the varying number of days in each month. In this case, December has 31 days, so moving back one month from January 2 will result in December 2.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the current date, which marks Jane's 3-year work anniversary from her start date in 2016. Given that Jane spilled coffee on her laptop on her second day at work, which was December 2, the current date can be calculated by adding 3 years to December 2, 2016. This will provide the date that corresponds to Jane's 3-year work anniversary.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to add 3 years to a specific date (December 2, 2016) to find the current date. This involves understanding how to increment the year while keeping the month and day constant. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle date arithmetic and accurately calculate the date that is 3 years after a given starting date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle year increments while maintaining the month and day.\n\n2. **Calculate Work Anniversary Date:**\n   - Write a rule to add 3 years to a given date (December 2, 2016) to find Jane's 3-year work anniversary date.\n   - Increment the year by 3 while keeping the month and day the same.\n\n3. **Handling Leap Years:**\n   - Include logic to handle leap years when adding years to ensure the correct date calculation, especially when the starting date is close to a leap year.\n\n4. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the rule for adding years and finding the correct date based on the input date.\n\n5. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the program with different starting dates and anniversary durations to verify that the date calculation is accurate and handles various scenarios correctly.\n\n6. **User Interaction:**\n   - Create a user-friendly prompt that allows users to input the starting date and the work anniversary duration to calculate the current date.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the current date that marks Jane's 3-year work anniversary based on her start date and the known event on her second day at work.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, which means she started her job on December 2, 2016. Since she spilled coffee on her laptop on her second day at work, her second day would have been December 3, 2016. Therefore, today is December 2, 2019. To find the date tomorrow, we need to increment the current date by one day, which would be December 3, 2019.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves incrementing the current date by one day to find the date tomorrow. The key is to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end transitions and potential year changes. In this case, we need to increment December 2, 2019, to December 3, 2019. Prolog can be used to implement rules for date incrementation and manage month and year transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. For example, if `MM` is 12 (December) and `DD` is 2, the next date should be December 3, 2019.\n\n3. **Month-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Include logic to handle the transition to the next month if the day exceeds the number of days in the current month. In this case, it is not needed as we are only incrementing by one day within the same month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition Rule:**\n   - Similarly, include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is December.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for simple day increments within the same month to verify that the date calculation is accurate.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for tomorrow based on the given input date, handling both simple and complex date transitions.

        "question": "In the UK, people usually put the day before the month when formatting the date. Therefore, today is 02/01/1987 to them. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?",
        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that today is January 2, 1987, formatted as 02/01/1987 in the UK date format. To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date. This will result in the date one week from today, which can be represented as January 9, 1987, in the UK date format (09/01/1987).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves adding a specific number of days to a given date to calculate a future date. In this case, we need to handle the increment of days while considering month-end transitions. Understanding the number of days in each month and correctly adjusting the date is crucial for accurate date calculations. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage these transitions and perform the necessary arithmetic operations to determine the date one week from today.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(DD, MM, YYYY)` to represent dates in the UK format (day/month/year).\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day by 1. If the day reaches the end of the month, reset it to 1 and increment the month.\n   - Special consideration should be given to the end of December, where the year should also be incremented.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months, ensuring that the correct number of days is accounted for in each month.\n   - Adjust the month and year appropriately when transitioning from the last day of a month to the first day of the next month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, especially when transitioning from February to March. Leap years have 29 days in February.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to add a specific number of days (in this case, 7 days) to the current date. This rule should handle month-end and year-end transitions.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search capabilities to apply the correct rules based on the current date and ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one week from today, considering different scenarios such as month transitions, year transitions, and leap years.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one week from today in the UK date format, handling all necessary transitions and special cases effectively.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date tomorrow, given that today is Jane's 5th visit to the bookstore, which occurs on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. Since it is her 5th visit today, we can infer that she visited the bookstore in October, November, December, January, and February. Therefore, today's date is February 16, 2010. To find the date tomorrow, we need to increment the day by 1, resulting in February 17, 2010, represented as 02/17/2010 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating the date following a specific pattern of monthly visits. By identifying the current visit number and the starting month, we can determine the current date. Incrementing the date by one day to find tomorrow's date involves handling month-end transitions and leap years. In Prolog, we can define rules to manage these transitions and calculate the next day's date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and month transitions.\n\n2. **Calculate Current Date:**\n   - Determine the current date based on Jane's 5th visit pattern, starting from October 2009 and occurring on the 16th of each month.\n   - Given that today is her 5th visit, the current date is February 16, 2010.\n\n3. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day by 1 to find tomorrow's date. For example, if today is February 16, 2010, tomorrow's date should be February 17, 2010.\n\n4. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when incrementing the day.

This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation.",

To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to March 12, 2002. This will lead us to March 19, 2002, represented as 03/19/2002 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known current date and a specified interval (one week). The challenge includes handling the transition between days, months, and potentially years when adding days. In this case, we need to increment the date by 7 days to find the date one week from today. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for date incrementation and managing month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the date after adding a specified number of days.\n   - This function should handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Define a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. If the day reaches the end of the month, it should roll over to the next month.\n\n4. **Month-End Transition:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition when the day is the last day of the month. If the month is December, the year should also be incremented.\n\n5. **Leap Year Handling:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years, which is crucial for handling February correctly. Adjust the end date of February to 29 days in a leap year.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate the date one week from today by adding 7 days to the current date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that yesterday was January 21, 2011. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from January 21, 2011. This involves handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 7 days from January 21, 2011, would result in January 14, 2011.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is exactly one week (7 days) prior to a given date. The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - This structure should be capable of handling decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. If the day is the first of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting 7 days from January 21, 2011, should result in January 14, 2011.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from January 1st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date one week prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases. This will involve defining rules for day subtraction, handling month and year transitions, and recursively applying these rules to achieve the desired date calculation.",

The key is to increment the day by 7 while considering potential month and year transitions. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for date incrementation and managing month and year boundaries.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle date arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the date one week from the given date.\n   - This function should increment the day by 7, handling month-end transitions and year-end transitions.\n\n3. **Handling Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within the `increment_date` function to handle transitions between months and years when adding days.\n   - Ensure that when the day exceeds the number of days in the month, the month is incremented, and the day resets to 1.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which may be necessary for handling February correctly.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date one week later, the function should recursively call itself seven times.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify that the `increment_date` function correctly calculates the date one week from a given date, handling month-end and year-end transitions.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date one week from a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases, such as the end of the month or year and leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week from today, given that May 6, 1992, is perceived as yesterday by Jane, but it is actually ten years ago. Since May 6, 1992, is ten years in the past, today's date is May 6, 2002. To find the date one week from today, we need to add seven days to May 6, 2002.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is a certain number of days ahead of a given date. In this case, we need to handle the transition from one day to the next, considering month and year boundaries. Prolog can be used to manage these calculations by defining rules for incrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle increments in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 within the same month. If the day is the last day of the month, the rule should correctly identify the first day of the next month.\n   - For example, adding one day to May 6, 2002, should result in May 7, 2002.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the next month when adding days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day increment rule repeatedly, incrementing the count until it reaches the desired number of days.\n   - This will handle the addition of any number of days, including transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive addition to accurately compute the date one week from today.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as adding days to January 31st or during leap and non-leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the addition of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days ahead of a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

In this case, adding 24 hours to December 24 will result in December 25. It is important to handle the end of the month correctly and ensure that the year is adjusted if necessary. Prolog can be used to define rules for date incrementation and manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments.\n\n2. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_date(Date, NewDate)` that calculates the next day's date given a date.\n   - This function should handle the transition from one day to the next, including month and year transitions.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to check if the current day is the last day of the month. If so, roll over to the first day of the next month.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a rule to check if the year is a leap year to correctly handle February in leap years.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to calculate a date after a given number of days from a starting date. For example, to find the date 24 hours later, the function should recursively call itself once.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching to determine whether to increment the day or roll over to a new month or year based on the current date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for transitions between months (e.g., from December 31 to January 1), transitions between years, and during leap years for February.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date for the next day based on the given input date, handling month and year transitions correctly, including leap years.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date one week ago from today, given that a concert originally scheduled for June 1, 1943, was delayed by one day to June 2, 1943. To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from June 2, 1943.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a date that is one week (7 days) prior to a given date. This requires understanding how to handle day decrements and transitions between months and potentially years if the subtraction spans over such boundaries. In this case, subtracting 7 days from June 2, 1943, would land in the previous month, May. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for decrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtraction of Days:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. If the day reaches the first day of the month, the rule should correctly identify the last day of the previous month.\n   - For example, subtracting 7 days from June 2, 1943, should result in May 26, 1943.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. This includes knowing the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and day accordingly.\n   - Special cases for months like February should be considered, and leap years should be checked to determine if February has 28 or 29 days.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of 7 days, ensuring correct transitions through multiple months or even years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify the functionality of the date subtraction, including scenarios that cross month and year boundaries, such as subtracting days from the first day of a month or during leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date one week prior to a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

If `MM` is December and `DD` is 31, then `MM` should reset to January, `DD` to 1, and `YYYY` should increment by 1.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a single day repeatedly. It should increment `Days` each time until `Days` reaches 7, at which point `NewDate` is the final result.\n\n4. **Handling Month and Year End:**\n   - Implement specific rules within `increment_day` to handle the transition from one month to another and from one year to the next, considering different month lengths and leap years.\n\n5. **Leap Year Calculation:**\n   - Include a helper predicate to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February in leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to match conditions for month-end and year-end transitions. This will ensure that the correct rules are applied based on the current date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases that check the functionality of `add_days` across different scenarios, including month-end, year-end, and leap years. For example, adding 7 days to July 9, 1972, should result in July 16, 1972.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately compute the date one week from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve defining rules for date increments and transitions, leveraging Prolog's capabilities for pattern matching and recursion.",

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to increment the date by one day. Given that July has 31 days, adding one day to July 9 will result in July 10, 1972.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves a simple increment of the day by one within the same month. The key is to ensure that the increment does not cross the month boundary. In this case, since July 9 is the input date, adding 24 hours will lead to July 10. Understanding the month boundaries and handling the day incrementation appropriately is crucial for solving this task.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments within the same month.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1 if it is not the last day of the month.

This includes adjusting the month and day based on the number of days in each month.\n   - Special cases for February and leap years should be considered to ensure accurate date calculations.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day subtraction rule repeatedly, decrementing the count until it reaches zero.\n   - This will handle the subtraction of multiple days, including transitions through different months.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check if a year is a leap year, which will be crucial for handling February correctly during leap years.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive subtraction to accurately compute the date one week ago.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month boundaries, such as subtracting days from the beginning of a month.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the subtraction of seven days and accurately calculates the date one week ago.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to determine the date one week ago from the given date, handling month transitions and leap years effectively. This will provide a robust solution to the date calculation problem using SWI-Prolog\u2019s capabilities.",

To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to January 1, 1930.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis problem involves calculating a future date based on a known current date and a specified interval (one week). The challenge includes handling the transition between months and potentially years if the addition spans over such boundaries. In this case, adding 7 days to January 1, 1930, would result in January 8, 1930. Prolog can be used to handle these calculations by defining rules for incrementing days and handling month and year transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day increments and transitions between months and years.\n\n2. **Increment Day Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to increment the day by 1. If the day exceeds the number of days in the month, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when incrementing days. This includes adjusting the month and day appropriately.\n\n4. **Year-End Transition:**\n   - Include a rule to handle the transition to the next year if the month is December and the day is the last day of the month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic for Multiple Days:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule that applies the single-day increment rule repeatedly, incrementing the count until it reaches 7 days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to efficiently find and apply the correct rules for day and month transitions.\n   - Ensure that the correct path is followed in the recursive addition to accurately compute the date one week from today.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Test the logic with dates that require crossing month and year boundaries, such as incrementing days from December 31 or during leap years.\n   - Verify that the program correctly handles the addition of various numbers of days, such as 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program capable of calculating a date some days ahead of a given date, considering all necessary transitions and special cases.

To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to September 8th, 2021, which will result in September 15th, 2021.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date that is exactly one week (7 days) from the current date. This involves understanding how to increment the day by 7 while considering month boundaries and potential year changes. In this case, the calculation spans within the same month, so we only need to increment the day value. Prolog can be used to handle these date calculations by defining rules for incrementing days and handling month transitions.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations that add days to dates.\n\n2. **Increment Day Function:**\n   - Write a function `increment_day(date(MM, DD, YYYY), NewDate)` that calculates the date one day later. This function should handle month-end transitions by incrementing the month and resetting the day to 1 when necessary.\n\n3. **Add Days Function:**\n   - Develop a recursive function `add_days(date(MM, DD, YYYY), Days, NewDate)` that uses `increment_day` to add a specified number of days to a date. It should decrement the `Days` parameter with each iteration until it reaches 0.\n\n4. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic within `increment_day` to handle transitions between months. When the day exceeds the number of days in the current month, increment the month and adjust the day accordingly.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching in `increment_day` to correctly apply rules for day increments and month transitions based on the current date.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Create test cases to verify that the functions correctly calculate the date one week from the current date.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was one month ago from Jane and John's 5-year anniversary, which is today. Given that they married on January 2, 1958, their 5-year anniversary would be January 2, 1963. To find the date one month prior to this anniversary, we need to go back to December 2, 1962, as January has 31 days. Therefore, the date one month ago from their 5-year anniversary is December 2, 1962, represented as 12/02/1962 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another while considering the specific date of the anniversary. Since January has 31 days, we can simply subtract one month from the anniversary date to find the date one month prior. In Prolog, we can define rules to handle month transitions and calculate the date one month ago based on the given anniversary date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle month decrements and transitions.\n\n2. **Month Subtraction Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the current month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December. Otherwise, decrement the month by one.\n\n3. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day, adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months.\n\n5. **Calculate Date One Month Ago:**\n   - Use the month subtraction rule to calculate the date one month prior to the 5-year anniversary date of Jane and John's marriage.\n\n6. **Prolog Search and Pattern Matching:**\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to apply the rules for month subtraction and handle any necessary transitions based on the input date.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the program correctly calculates the date one month ago for different input dates, including month-end transitions and leap years.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog program will be able to accurately determine the date one month prior to Jane and John's 5-year anniversary, considering month transitions and leap years.

This involves incrementing the date by one day for each of the 40 days.\n\n3. **Increment Date Function:**\n   - Define a function to increment a given date by one day. This function should handle month-end transitions and year-end transitions.\n\n4. **Determine Tomorrow's Date:**\n   - Once the date after 40 days is calculated, use the increment date function to find the date for tomorrow.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle February dates when incrementing days.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to determine the correct date after 40 days and then find the date for tomorrow.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify the accuracy of the date calculation after 40 days and the determination of tomorrow's date.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date for tomorrow based on the given information about the consumption of eggs over a period of time.

In this case, the calculation is straightforward as it only involves subtracting days from the current date.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle day decrements.\n\n2. **Decrement Day Function:**\n   - Write a rule to decrement the day component of a date by a specified number of days. This rule should handle transitions between months correctly.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition to the previous month when subtracting days. Ensure that the day decrements correctly account for the varying number of days in each month.\n\n4. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to decrement the day by one day at a time until the desired number of days (in this case, 7 days) have been subtracted.\n\n5. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and backtracking to apply the decrement day rule correctly and efficiently find the date one week ago.\n\n6. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the date calculation for one week ago is accurate, considering different starting dates and potential month transitions.\n\n7. **Date Calculation for One Week Ago:**\n   - Given the current date (the day Jane ran out of eggs), use the decrement day function to calculate the date one week ago.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can accurately determine the date one week ago from the current date, handling month transitions and day decrements effectively.

        "plan": "**Explanation:**\n\nThe task is to determine the date that was 10 days ago from the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008. Therefore, to find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from March 31, 2008, which would result in March 21, 2008. This date can be represented as 03/21/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the subtraction of days from a given date, considering the month and year transitions. In this case, we are subtracting 10 days from the end of March, which may involve transitioning to the previous month. Understanding the number of days in each month and handling these transitions correctly is crucial. Prolog can be used to define rules for date arithmetic and manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Subtract Days Rule:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract a specified number of days from a given date. For example, subtracting 10 days from March 31, 2008, should result in March 21, 2008.\n\n3. **Handling Month Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle transitions between months when subtracting days. If the subtraction crosses into the previous month, adjust the month and day accordingly.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a rule to check for leap years to correctly handle February and ensure the correct number of days in each month.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to handle the subtraction of multiple days (in this case, 10 days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the input date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to verify that the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month boundaries, including end-of-month transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that accurately computes the date that was 10 days ago from the last day of the first quarter of 2008, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to increment the date by one day, resulting in April 1, 2008. This can be represented as 04/01/2008 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from March 31, 2008, to April 1, 2008, which involves incrementing the day by one. Since there are no month or year transitions in this case, the logic is straightforward. In Prolog, we can define rules to increment the day and handle any boundary conditions if necessary.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle basic arithmetic operations for day increments.\n\n2. **Normal Day Increment:**\n   - Write a rule that increments the day (`DD`) by 1. For example, if the current date is March 31, 2008, the next date should be April 1, 2008.\n\n3. **Handling Month-End Transitions:**\n   - Although not needed in this case, include logic to handle transitions between months, especially when the day is the last day of the month.\n\n4. **Handling Year-End Transitions:**\n   - Similarly, include logic to handle transitions between years if the increment crosses over to the next year.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Implement a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years, although it is not needed for this specific date calculation.\n\n6. **Recursive Logic:**\n   - Use a recursive rule to handle the transition from one day to the next, ensuring that the correct date is calculated.\n\n7. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to ensure the correct date transition is selected based on the input date.\n\n8. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for normal day transitions to verify that the program correctly calculates the date 24 hours later from March 31, 2008.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can compute the date 24 hours later based on the given input, handling day increments and ensuring the correct date calculation.
