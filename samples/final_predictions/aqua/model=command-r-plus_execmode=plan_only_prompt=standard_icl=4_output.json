For the word \"PROBLEC\":\n   \\[ 7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040 \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the number of distinct 7-letter words that can be formed from \"PROBLEC\" is 5040, corresponding to \\( 7! \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of permutations for the given set of letters in \"PROBLEC\".\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create a list representing the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\".\n\n2. **Permutation Calculation**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in permutation predicate or define a custom one to generate all possible permutations of the list of letters.\n\n3. **Counting Permutations**:\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s aggregation predicates to count the number of unique permutations generated from the original list. This step involves listing all permutations and then counting them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Implement efficient search through the space of all permutations of the provided letters.\n   - Use the `findall` predicate to gather all permutations and the `length` predicate to count them, ensuring we get the factorial number as calculated analytically.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of permutations, verifying that it matches \\( 7! = 5040 \\).\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling lists and permutations efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem. The code will highlight Prolog's strengths in recursion and list manipulation."

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nWe are given a car driving towards the base of a vertical tower with a constant speed. We observe the change in the angle of elevation as the car moves. The problem involves determining the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The car moves in a straight line with a constant speed.\n- The angle of elevation changes from 45 degrees to 60 degrees in 10 minutes.\n- We need to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n#### Formulas and Calculations:\n1. **Initial Distance to the Tower**:\n   - The car's motion creates a right triangle with the tower, where the distance from the car to the base of the tower is the hypotenuse, and the tower's height is the opposite side.\n   - Using trigonometry, we can find the initial distance \\( d \\) to the tower when the angle of elevation is 45 degrees: \\( d = height / tan(45\u00b0) = height / 1 \\) (since tan(45\u00b0) = 1).\n\n2. **Final Distance before Reaching the Tower**:\n   - When the angle of elevation becomes 60 degrees, the car is closer to the tower. Let's calculate this distance as well.\n   - Using the same principle, we can find the final distance \\( d' \\) to the tower when the angle is 60 degrees: \\( d' = height / tan(60\u00b0) = height / (\\sqrt{3}) \\) (since tan(60\u00b0) = \\sqrt{3}).\n\n3. **Distance Traveled by the Car**:\n   - The distance traveled by the car between these two angles is the difference between the initial and final distances: \n   \\( distance = d - d' = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\) \n\n4. **Speed of the Car**:\n   - Given that the car moves at a constant speed, we can calculate it using the distance traveled and the time taken (10 minutes) for the angle change:\n   \\( speed = \\frac{distance}{time} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{10} \\) \n\n5. **Time to Reach the Tower**:\n   - Now, we can find how much more time it will take for the car to reach the tower from its current position. \n   - This is calculated by dividing the remaining distance \\( d' \\) by the speed:\n   \\( time = \\frac{d'}{speed} \\) \n\nLet's calculate the values step by step:\n\\[ distance = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\n\\[ speed = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\n\\[ time = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\div \\frac{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{\\sqrt{3}} = 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is the car will reach the base of the tower after **5(\u221a3 + 1)** minutes more.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time taken for the car to reach the base of the tower based on the provided information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define constants for the initial and final angles (45 degrees and 60 degrees), the time taken for the angle change (10 minutes), and the height of the tower.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial and Final Distances**:\n   - Implement predicates to calculate the initial and final distances using trigonometric functions (`cos`, `sin`, `tan`) based on the given angles and the height of the tower.\n\n3. **Compute Distance Traveled and Car Speed**:\n   - Calculate the distance traveled by the car between the initial and final distances.\n   - Determine the speed of the car using the distance traveled and the given time.\n\n4. **Calculate Time to Reach the Tower**:\n   - Compute the remaining time required for the car to reach the tower base from its current position.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Trigonometry Functions**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions (`is`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and trigonometric functions to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated time in minutes, ensuring it matches the expected result of **5(\u221a3 + 1)**.\n\n### Outline for SWI",

The goal is to find out how long it will take for them to produce a total of 10 yo-yos. This can be solved using the concept of Least Common Multiple (LCM).\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- **Production Rate of Machine A**: 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes.\n- **Production Rate of Machine B**: 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes.\n- **Target**: Find the time it takes for both machines to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.\n\n#### Mathematical Approach:\n1. **Finding the LCM**:\n   To find the number of minutes, we need to determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9. The LCM of two numbers can be calculated by multiplying them and then dividing that product by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n   - **Calculating GCD**: The GCD of 6 and 9 is 3 since 3 is the largest number that divides both 6 and 9.\n\n   - **LCM of 6 and 9**:\n     \\[ \\text{LCM} = \\frac{6 \\times 9}{\\text{GCD}} = \\frac{6 \\times 9}{3} = 18 \\]\n\n2. **Time to Produce 10 Yo-Yos**:\n   Since the LCM is 18, it takes 18 minutes for both machines to produce a total of \\( \\frac{10}{\\text{LCM}} = \\frac{10}{18} \\) sets of yo-yos.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **32 minutes**, as it takes 32 minutes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the time it takes for two machines with different production rates to produce a total of 10 yo-yos.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Machine Production Rates**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the production rates of Machine A (1 yo-yo every 6 minutes) and Machine B (1 yo-yo every 9 minutes).\n\n2. **Calculate LCM**:\n   - Implement a predicate to find the LCM of two numbers. You can use Prolog's `gcd/3` predicate to find the greatest common divisor and then calculate the LCM as `(Number1 * Number2) / GCD`.\n\n3. **Determine Total Time**:\n   - Use the LCM to calculate the total time it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos. This can be done by multiplying the LCM by the number of sets of yo-yos required (10 in this case).\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated time, showing that it matches the option \"B) 32 minutes.\"\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define machine production rates\nmachine_a_rate(6).\nmachine_b_rate(9).\n\n% Calculate LCM of two numbers\nlcm(X, Y, LCM) :-\n    gcd(X, Y, GCD),\n    LCM is (X * Y) / GCD.\n\n% Calculate total time\ntotal_time(Minutes) :-\n    machine_a_rate(RateA),\n    machine_b_rate(RateB),\n    lcm(RateA, RateB, LCM),\n    Minutes is LCM * 10.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code will effectively compute the time it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos, demonstrating the practical application of LCM calculations in Prolog.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nTo determine how far Bill can travel on his bicycle on a windy day in 21 minutes, we need to consider his average speed on a normal day and the reduction in speed due to the wind.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Bill's average speed on a normal day is 15 mph.\n- On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph.\n- We need to calculate the distance he can cover in 21 minutes.\n\n#### Calculations:\n1. **Bill's Speed on a Windy Day**:\n   - His speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed on a windy day is: 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.\n\n2. **Distance Covered in 21 Minutes**:\n   - To find the distance covered, we use the formula: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time.\n   - Distance = 11 mph \u00d7 (21 minutes / 60 minutes) = 11/3 miles.\n\nSo, Bill can travel approximately **3.67 miles** on a windy day in 21 minutes. When rounded to the nearest hundredth, the answer is **3.67 miles** or **3.67 miles**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nTo create a SWI-Prolog code that calculates the distance Bill can travel on a windy day, given his average speed and the time duration of his ride.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define predicates or facts for Bill's average speed on a normal day (15 mph) and the speed reduction on a windy day (4 mph).\n   - Input the time duration of 21 minutes.\n\n2. **Calculate Bill's Speed on a Windy Day**:\n   - Create a predicate that subtracts the speed reduction from his average speed to find his speed on a windy day.\n\n3. **Compute Distance Covered**:\n   - Implement a predicate that multiplies Bill's speed on a windy day by the given time duration to calculate the distance covered.\n\n4. **Convert Time to Fractional Hours**:\n   - Ensure that the time duration is converted to fractional hours by dividing the minutes by 60.\n\n5. **Rounding the Result**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic functions to round the calculated distance to the nearest hundredth.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the rounded distance, providing the units (miles).\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define average speed and speed reduction\nnormal_speed(15).\nspeed_reduction(4).\n\n% Input time duration\ntime(21).\n\n% Calculate Bill's speed on a windy day\nwindy_speed(Speed) :-\n    normal_speed(N),\n    speed_reduction(R),\n    Speed is N - R.\n\n% Compute distance covered\ndistance(Miles) :-\n    windy_speed(S),\n    time(T),\n    Miles is S * (T / 60).\n\n% Round the result to the nearest hundredth\nround_distance(Result) :-\n    distance(D),\n    R is round(D*100)/100,\n    format('Bill can travel ~w miles on a windy day in 21 minutes.', [R]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code incorporates the necessary calculations and rounding to determine the distance Bill can cover on his bicycle ride, providing a clear and structured solution to the problem.",

Find the area of the sheet.\n# Answer option: ['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n- When the rectangular sheet is folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm.\n- When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.\n- We need to find the area of the original rectangular sheet.\n\n#### Understanding Perimeters:\n1. **Perimeter of Equal Halves**:\n   - When a rectangle is folded into two equal halves, the perimeter of each half remains the same as the original rectangle.\n   - So, the original rectangle's perimeter is also 48 cm.\n\n2. **Dimensions of the Rectangle**:\n   - Let the length and width of the rectangle be $L$ and $W$ respectively.\n   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is $P = 2 \\times (L + W)$.\n   - For the first case, $48 = 2 \\times (L + W)$.\n\n3. **Solving for Side Lengths**:\n   - We have two equations:\n   \\[ L + W = 24 \\]\n   We don't have enough information to solve for $L$ and $W$ uniquely, but we can express $L$ in terms of $W$:\n   \\[ L = 24 - W \\]\n\n4. **Second Fold Case**:\n   - For the second case, when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm.\n   - This means the sum of two sides is 66 cm, assuming the folded sides are opposite each other.\n   - Let's denote the sides as $W$ (width) and $S$ (a new side).\n   - So, $W + S = 66$, or $S = 66 - W$.\n\n#### Finding the Area:\n1. **Substitute and Eliminate**:\n   - We can substitute $L = 24 - W$ into the equation $L \\times W = \\text{Area}$:\n   \\[ (24 - W)W = \\text{Area} \\]\n\n2. **Multiplying and Expanding**:\n   - Expanding the equation above:\n   \\[ 24W - W^2 = \\text{Area} \\]\n\n3. **Solving for Area**:\n   - To solve for Area, rearrange the equation:\n   \\[ \\text{Area} = 24W - W^2 \\]\n\n4. **Plugging in the Values**:\n   - We can find $W$ from either case, but for consistency, we'll use the value from the first case: $W = 24 - W$. So, $W = 12$.\n   - Plug $W = 12$ into the equation for Area:\n   \\[ \\text{Area} = 24 \\times 12 - 12^2 = 1120 \\]\n\nSo, the area of the rectangular sheet is 1120 square units.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nThe goal is to develop a Prolog program that calculates the area of the rectangular sheet based on the given perimeter information when folded differently.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Knowns**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the known information, such as the perimeters when folded in different ways.\n\n2. **Establish Relationships**:\n   - Set up predicates to express the relationships between the sides. For example, $L + W = 24$ and $W + S = 66$.\n\n3. **Solve for Unknowns**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic and logical capabilities to solve for the unknown side lengths.\n\n4. **Calculate Area**:\n   - Once the values of $L$ and $W$ are determined, calculate the area using the formula $L \\times W$.\n\n5. **Optimize and Verify**:\n   - Ensure that the calculated area is consistent with the expected answer of 1120 square units.\n   - Optimize the code by avoiding redundant calculations and utilizing Prolog's built-in arithmetic functions efficiently.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n\n```prolog\n% Known perimeters when folded\nperimeter_case1(48).\nperimeter_case2(66).\n\n% Relationships between sides\nside_relationship1(L, W) :-\n    L + W =< 48,  % Ensure the sum is less than or equal to the perimeter\n    L >= 0, W >= 0.\n\nside_relationship2(W, S) :-\n    W + S =< 66,\n    W >= 0, S >= 0.\n\n% Find side lengths\nfind_side_lengths(L, W, S) :-\n    perimeter_case1(P1),\n    perimeter_",

We can calculate this as a percentage of the whole student body.\n\n3. **Total Swim Team Membership**:\n   - To find the total percentage of students who are members of the swim team, we combine the percentages from steps 1 and 2.\n\nLet's denote:\n- **T**: Total number of students at Daifu University\n- **B**: Number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team (24% of T)\n- **S**: Number of students who are members of only the swim team (unknown)\n- **C**: Number of students who are members of only the chess club and not the swim team (unknown)\n\nGiven that 20% of the swim team members are not in the chess club:\n\\[ \\text{20% of (B + S)} = \\text{B} + \\text{S} - \\text{overlapping portion} = S \\]\n\nSo, \\( 0.2(B + S) = S \\) which gives:\n\\[ S = 0.2(B + S) \\]\n\\[ 0.8S = 0.2B \\]\n\\[ S = 0.25B \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total percentage of students who are members of the swim team:\n\\[ \\text{Total%} = \\frac{B + S}{T} \\times 100 \\]\n\nPlugging in \\( B = 0.24T \\) and \\( S = 0.25B \\):\n\\[ \\text{Total%} = \\frac{0.24T + 0.25(0.24T)}{T} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total%} = \\frac{0.24T + 0.06T}{T} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.3T}{T} \\times 100 = 30% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 30%.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the percentage of all Daifu University students who are members of the swim team, considering the given conditions about overlapping membership with the chess club.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Relationships**:\n   - Define the given percentages as facts or constants: 24% for overlapping membership and 20% for the portion of the swim team not in the chess club.\n\n2. **Calculate Isolated Swim Team Membership**:\n   - Set up a predicate to calculate the number of students (S) who are members of only the swim team based on the given relationships.\n\n3. **Compute Total Swim Team Membership**:\n   - Create a predicate to calculate the total number of students who are members of the swim team (including those in both the swim team and chess club).\n\n4. **Convert to Percentage**:\n   - Multiply the total number of students in the swim team by 100 and then divide by the total number of students (T) to get the percentage.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the calculations using Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators.\n   - Utilize logical predicates to establish relationships between the given percentages and the unknown values.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated percentage, ensuring it matches the expected result of 30%.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline\n\n```prolog\n%% Define given percentages\noverlapping_membership(24).\nswim_team_only(20).\n\n%% Calculate number of students who are members of only the swim team\ncalculate_swim_team_only(STOnly, Overlap, Total) :-\n    STOnly is (100 - Overlap) * Total / 100.\n\n%% Calculate total number of students in the swim team\ncalculate",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nWe are given a chocolate store with two types of chocolates: vanilla and cocoa, where 10% of the chocolates are cocoa-flavored. To find the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n- The total number of cocoa chocolates is 10% of the whole collection.\n- 90% of the remaining chocolates (which are vanilla) are squashed. This means only 10% of the vanilla chocolates remain intact.\n- To find the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed, we multiply the percentage of vanilla chocolates (90% since cocoa is 10%) by the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed (10%). This gives us 9% as the final answer.\n\n### Math Breakdown:\n- Total cocoa chocolates: 10%\n- Total vanilla chocolates: 100% - 10% = 90%\n- Vanilla chocolates that are not squashed: 90% of 90% = 81% (since 90% are squashed)\n- Percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed: 90% x 10% = 9%\n\n### Plan for SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nTo calculate the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Input the total number of chocolates or assume a quantity (if not given).

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves finding a set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square.\n\n#### Understanding Consecutive Odd Numbers:\nConsecutive odd numbers differ by 2. For example, if you list odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ... you'll notice that the difference between each number is 2. This pattern continues for two-digit odd numbers as well.\n\n#### Analyzing the Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers:\nLet's consider five consecutive odd two-digit numbers as \\( x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8 \\). Their sum can be calculated using the arithmetic series formula:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = 5 \\times (x + x + 8) / 2 = 25x + 50 \\]\n\nFor this sum to be divisible by 10, the units digit of the sum must be 0. So, we want to find a value of \\( x \\) such that the units digit of \\( 25x + 50 \\) is 0. Through trial and error, or by solving \\( 5x \\) modulo 10 equals to 0, we find that \\( x \\) should be a multiple of 4.\n\nNow, we want this sum to be a perfect square when divided by 10. That is, the remainder when the sum is divided by 10 should be a perfect square. Testing small perfect squares modulo 10, we find that only 0 and 4 square to 0 and 4, respectively, modulo 10.\n\n#### Identifying Possible Values of \\( x \\):\nSince \\( x \\) should be a multiple of 4, testing options:\n1. \\( x = 4n \\):\n   \\[ 25x + 50 = 100n + 20 \\]\n   This expression always has a units digit of 0, but it doesn't square to 4 modulo 10, so it doesn't meet our criteria.\n2. \\( x = 4n + 2 \\):\n   \\[ 25x + 50 = 100n + 550 \\]\n   This expression always has a units digit of 0, and it squares to 4 modulo 10.\n\nSo, \\( x = 4n + 2 \\) is the solution, and the smallest value of \\( x \\) that satisfies this is 42.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to identify the possible set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers that meet the given criteria.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define the Criteria**:\n   - Express the conditions for the sum of the five consecutive odd two-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Options**:\n   - Use a loop or recursion to iterate through possible values of \\( x \\) (starting from 42) to find the first set of five numbers that satisfy the criteria.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum and Check Conditions**:\n   - For each set of numbers, calculate their sum.\n   - Check if the sum divided by 10 leaves a remainder of a perfect square (0 or 4).\n\n4. **Prolog's Arithmetic and Comparison Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates (`is`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`) for calculations and comparisons.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the set of five numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define the criteria for the sum\ncriteria(X, Sum) :-\n    Sum is (X + X + 8) * 5,  % Sum of the five consecutive numbers\n    Sum mod 10 =:= 4.       % Sum divided by 10 leaves a remainder of a perfect square (4 in this case)\n\n% Find the first set of five numbers that satisfy the criteria\nfind_numbers(X, [X, Y, Z, W, V]) :-\n    X >= 42,\n    Y is X + 2,\n    Z is X + 4,\n    W is X + 6,\n    V is X + 8,\n    criteria(X, Sum),\n    write('The numbers are: '),\n    write([X, Y, Z, W, V]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the criteria and then searches for the first set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers that satisfy the conditions.

Let's denote the side length as $s$.\n\n2. **Dimensions after Trimming**:\n   - When 4 feet is trimmed from one side, the square becomes a rectangle with dimensions $(s-4)$ and $s$.\n\n3. **Area of the Rectangle**:\n   - The area of the rectangle formed after trimming is $s \\times (s-4)$ square feet.\n\n4. **Area of Each Triangle**:\n   - When the rectangle is cut diagonally, it forms two congruent triangles. So, the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle: $(s \\times (s-4))/2$ square feet.\n\n5. **Setting up the Equation**:\n   - We are given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we set up the equation:\n     \\[ 70 = \\frac{s(s-4)}{2} \\]\n\n6. **Solving for $s$**:\n   - Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n     \\[ 140 = s(s-4) \\]\n   - Expanding the right side, we have:\n     \\[ 140 = s^2 - 4s \\]\n   - Rearranging and simplifying, we get:\n     \\[ s^2 - 140 = 4s \\]\n   - Further simplifying and factoring:\n     \\[ s^2 - 100 = 0 \\]\n     \\[ (s - 10)(s + 10) = 0 \\]\n\n7. **Solving for $s$**:\n   - From the quadratic formula or factoring, we find:\n     \\[ s = 10 \\, \\text{feet or} \\, s = -10 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n   - Since side lengths cannot be negative, we take $s = 10$ feet.\n\n8. **Perimeter of the Original Square**:\n   - The perimeter of a square is given by $4s$, so the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth was $4 \\times 10 = \\text{40 feet}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the perimeter was 40 feet.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth based on the given dimensions and conditions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Start by understanding the problem statement and defining the known and unknown quantities.\n\n2. **Create Predicates**:\n   - Define predicates to represent the relationships between the side length ($s$), the area of the triangles, and the perimeter of the square.\n\n3. **Calculate Side Length**:\n   - Set up the equation relating the area of the triangles to the side length of the square.\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for $s$.\n\n4. **Compute Perimeter**:\n   - Calculate the perimeter of the original square using the formula $4s$.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated perimeter, ensuring it matches the expected result of 40 feet.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the area of each triangle\ntriangle_area(70).\n\n% Calculate the side length of the original square\nsquare_side(SideLength) :-\n    triangle_area(Area),\n    % Set up the equation and solve for side length\n    (Area * 2) is SideLength * (SideLength - 4),\n    % Ensure side length is positive\n    SideLength > 0.\n\n% Calculate the perimeter of the square\nsquare_perimeter(Perimeter) :-\n    square_side(SideLength),\n    Perimeter is 4 * SideLength.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_square_perimeter :-\n    square_perimeter(Perimeter),\n    write('The perimeter of the original square is '),\n    write(Perimeter),\n    write(' feet.').\n```\n\nThis code will guide the Prolog interpreter through the necessary steps to calculate the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, demonstrating Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic operations and problem-solving tasks.",

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all members' ages is 250. We want to find the number of members in the club.\n\n#### Understanding Arithmetic Progression:\nIn an A.P., the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the youngest member's age as the first term (\\(a\\)) and the common difference as \\(d\\):\n- First term \\(a = 7\\) years (age of the youngest member)\n- Common difference \\(d = 3\\) months\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Members:\nWe can use the formula for the sum of an A.P.:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2a + (n - 1)d] \\), where \\(n\\) is the number of terms (members in the club).\n\nGiven that the sum of ages is 250, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [2 \\times 7 + (n - 1) \\times 3] \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ 500 = n \\times [14 + 3n - 3] \\]\n\\[ 500 = n \\times (3n + 11) \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\(n\\), which represents the number of members:\n\\[ 500 = 3n^2 + 11n \\]\n\nSubtract 500 from both sides:\n\\[ 0 = 3n^2 + 11n - 500 \\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\\[ 0 = (3n - 25)(n + 20) \\]\n\nSolving for \\(n\\), we get:\n\\[ n = \\frac{25}{3} \\approx 8.33 \\] or \\(n = -20\\).\n\nSince we are dealing with a positive number of members, we take the positive value and approximate it to the nearest whole number:\n\\[ n \\approx \\frac{25}{3} \\approx 8 \\]\n\nSo, the number of members in the club is approximately 8. However, since there cannot be a fraction of a member, we consider the immediate next integer value, which is 9.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of members in the club based on the given age progression and sum of ages.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Input: The youngest member's age (\\(a\\)) is 7 years, the common difference (\\(d\\)) is 3 months, and the sum of ages (\\(S\\)) is 250.\n   - Output: The number of members (\\(n\\)) in the club.\n\n2. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - Use the formula for the sum of an A.P. to derive an equation relating \\(n\\), \\(a\\), \\(d\\), and \\(S\\).\n\n3. **Solve for 'n'**:\n   - Manipulate the equation to solve for the number of members (\\(n\\)).\n\n4. **Consider the Positive Value**:\n   - Since the number of members must be positive, consider only the positive root of the quadratic equation.\n\n5. **Round to the Nearest Integer**:\n   - Given the nature of the problem, round the result to the nearest integer to get the final answer for the number of members.\n\n6. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Comparison Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates and comparison operators to perform calculations and make decisions.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of members, ensuring it aligns with the expected answer of 9.\n\n### Outline for SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n```prolog\n% Calculate the number of members in the club\nnumber_of_members(N) :-\n    % Define inputs\n    a = 7,\n    d = 3,\n    S = 250,\n\n    % Calculate n using the formula for sum of A.P.\n    N is round((S - a) / (d + a)),\n\n    % Ensure n is positive\n    N > 0.\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of members based on the given inputs and mathematical relationships, demonstrating Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic and decision-making.",

In this case, Train 'B' is faster than Train 'A,' and their relative speed is (72 kmph - 40 kmph) = 32 kmph.\n\n#### Calculating Time for Trains to Meet:\n1. **Distance Covered by Train 'A' before Train 'B' Departs**:\n   - Train 'A' has a 3-hour head start, so it covers \\( 40 \\, \\text{kmph} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 120 \\) km before Train 'B' starts moving.\n\n2. **Time for Train 'B' to Catch Up**:\n   - With a relative speed of 32 kmph, we can calculate the time it takes for Train 'B' to cover the 120 km distance:\n   \\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative Speed}} = \\frac{120 \\, \\text{km}}{32 \\, \\text{kmph}} = \\frac{120}{32} \\, \\text{hours} = \\frac{15}{4} \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n   This means it will take \\( \\frac{15}{4} \\) hours, or 15/4 of an hour, for Train 'B' to catch up to Train 'A'.\n\n3. **Converting Time to Standard Format**:\n   - Convert the time into hours and minutes:\n   \\[ \\frac{15}{4} \\, \\text{hours} = 3 \\, \\text{hours} \\, 45 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nSo, Train 'B' will catch up to Train 'A' 3 hours and 45 minutes after its departure at 2:00 PM, which means they will meet at **5:45 PM on the same day**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time when the two trains will meet, considering their speeds and departure times.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Input Parameters**:\n   - Create predicates to input the departure time, speed, and distance traveled for each train.\n\n2. **Calculate Relative Speed**:\n   - Implement a predicate to compute the relative speed between the two trains (speed of Train 'B' minus speed of Train 'A').\n\n3. **Compute Head Start Distance**:\n   - Calculate the distance covered by Train 'A' before Train 'B' departs, considering its head start in time.\n\n4. **Determine Catch-Up Time**:\n   - Use the relative speed to find the time it takes for Train 'B' to cover the head start distance.\n\n5. **Add Catch-Up Time to Train 'B's Departure Time**:\n   - Add the catch-up time to Train 'B's departure time to find the meeting time.\n\n6. **Convert Meeting Time to Standard Format**:\n   - Convert the meeting time into hours and minutes, and display it in a readable format.\n\n7. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Temporal Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates for calculations involving speeds, distances, and times.\n   - Employ temporal reasoning to handle time-related computations effectively.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Outline\n\n```prolog\nmeet_time(train_a_time, train_a_speed, train_b_time, train_b_speed, meet_time) :-\n    % Calculate relative speed\n    relative_speed(train_a_speed, train_b_speed, RelSpeed),\n    \n    % Compute head start distance\n    head_start_distance(train_a_time, train_b_time, HeadStartDist),\n    \n    % Calculate time for Train 'B' to catch up\n    catch_up_time(RelSpeed, HeadStartDist, CatchUpTime),\n    \n    % Add catch-up time to Train 'B's departure time\n    time_sum(train_b_time, CatchUpTime, meet",

We can then denote the number of employees taking a winter vacation as 75% of the total. Similarly, the number of employees taking neither a winter nor a summer vacation can be represented as 20% of the total.\n\nNow, we want to find the percentage of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

(Equation 1)\n\n2. **Sum of Squares of Digits**:\n   - The sum of the squares of its digits is: \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \\) ... (Equation 2)\n\n3. **Subtracting 495**:\n   - When you subtract 495, you get a new number with the same digits in reverse order. Let's call this new number \\( cba \\).\n   - So, \\( 1000a + 100b + 10c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \\)\n   - Simplifying this equation, we get: \\( 990a + 90b - 9c = 0 \\) ...

(Equation 5)\n\nNow, we have two equations (Equation 4 and Equation 5) with three variables. We can substitute various small values for \\( c \\) in Equation 4 and check which value satisfies Equation 5.\n\nTrying \\( c = 0 \\):\n- Equation 4: \\( 89a + 7b = 0 \\) gives \\( a = 0, b = 0 \\), but this doesn't satisfy Equation 5.\n\nTrying \\( c = 1 \\):\n- Equation 4: \\( 89a + 7b = 99 \\).

What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?\n# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']",

To find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, we can set up and solve a simple equation:\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- **Earnings per Copper Coin**: 20 cents\n- **Earnings per Brass Coin**: 25 cents\n- **Total Earnings**: $3.40\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\n1. **Equation for Total Earnings**:\n   Let's assume the coin diver brought 'C' copper coins and 'B' brass coins.\n\n   - For copper coins: Earnings = 20 cents \u00d7 C = $0.20C\n   - For brass coins: Earnings = 25 cents \u00d7 B = $0.25B\n   - Her total earnings are the sum of these: $3.40 = $0.20C + $0.25B\n\n2. **Solving for C**:\n   To find the minimum number of copper coins (C), we can express $3.40 solely in terms of C:\n   \\[ 3.40 = 0.20C + 0.25B \\]\n   \\[ 10 = 2C + B \\]\n\n   If we assume B is positive, then the minimum value of B is 0 (if she found no brass coins). In that case:\n   \\[ 10 = 2C \\]\n   \\[ C = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\n   So, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 5, and the rest were brass coins.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the minimum number of copper coins the coin diver brought, given her total earnings and earnings per coin type.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define the earnings per copper coin (20 cents), earnings per brass coin (25 cents), and total earnings ($3.40).\n\n2. **Equations and Relationships**:\n   - Set up the equation $0.20C + $0.25B = $3.40.\n   - Assume B to be positive or zero (as it makes sense in the context).\n\n3. **Solve for Minimum Copper Coins (C)**:\n   - Rewrite the equation to isolate C: $10 = $2C.\n   - Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of C.\n\n4. **Prolog Search and Verification**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations and conversions.\n   - Verify that the calculated minimum number of copper coins makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the minimum number of copper coins brought by the coin diver.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define constants and predicates\ncopper_earnings(0.20).\nbrass_earnings(0.25).\ntotal_earnings(3.40).\n\n% Calculate minimum number of copper coins\nminimum_copper_coins(C) :-\n    copper_earnings(CE),\n    brass_earnings(BE),\n    total_earnings(TE),\n    TE >= 0,           % Ensure total earnings are non-negative\n    C is ceil((TE - BE) / CE).\n```\n\nThis code defines the relevant constants and uses Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the minimum number of copper coins, rounding up with `ceil` to ensure a whole number.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nGiven the quadratic equation $x^2 + mx + 22 = 0$, we are asked to find the value of $m$ when one of the roots is $1.5$.\n\n#### Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\nThe quadratic formula to find the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$\n\nIn our equation, $a = 1$, $b = m$, and $c = 22$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 22}}{2}.$$\n\nNow, we are given that one of the roots ($x$) is $1.5$. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$1.5 = \\frac{-m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 22}}{2}.$$\n\n#### Solving for $m$\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\n\n$$3 = -m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 88}.$$\n\nNow, we can see that the only way for this equation to be true is if we choose the negative sign in the square root:\n\n$$3 = -m - \\sqrt{m^2 - 88}.$$\n\nNow, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n$$9 = m^2 + 2m + 88.$$\n\nSimplifying and rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$$0 = m^2 + 2m - 79.$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the variable $m$.

After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nHow many times did the coin landed on Heads ?\n# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)23', 'C)16', 'D)18', 'E)12']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nIn this problem, Christopher and Jonathan are playing a game of chance with a coin, with varying payouts based on whether the coin lands on heads or tails. To determine how many times the coin landed on heads, we can set up and solve a simple equation based on the information provided.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Each heads outcome results in Christopher paying $2 to Jonathan.\n- Each tails outcome results in Jonathan paying $3 to Christopher.\n- After 20 flips, there is no net exchange of money, indicating a balance between heads and tails outcomes.\n\n#### Setting Up the Equation:\nLet $X$ represent the number of heads outcomes. Then, the number of tails outcomes would be $20 - X$.\n\n#### Calculating Payouts:\n- For heads outcomes, the total payout from Christopher to Jonathan is $2X dollars.\n- For tails outcomes, the total payout from Jonathan to Christopher is $3(20 - X)$ dollars.\n\n#### Equating Payouts:\nSince there is no net exchange of money, we can set the payouts equal to each other:\n\\[ 2X = 3(20 - X) \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for $X$:\n\\[ 2X = 60 - 3X \\]\n\\[ 5X = 60 \\)\n\\[ X = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the coin landed on heads $12$ times.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a SWI-Prolog program to model the coin-flipping game and determine the number of heads outcomes that would result in no net exchange of money between Christopher and Jonathan.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Game Rules**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the rules of the game, including the payouts for heads and tails outcomes.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - Define predicates for the number of heads outcomes ($X$) and tails outcomes (20 - $X$).\n   - Equate the total payouts for heads and tails, setting it to 0 since there is no net exchange of money.\n\n3. **Solve for Heads Outcomes**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve the equation for $X$, representing the number of heads outcomes.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the value of $X$, which represents the number of times the coin landed on heads.\n\n5. **Testing and Verification**:\n   - Implement a testing framework to verify that the code correctly calculates the number of heads outcomes for various potential scenarios.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline\n\n ```prolog\n% Rule definitions\nheads_payout(X, Y) :- Y is 2 * X.\ntails_payout(X, Z) :- Z is 3 * X.\n\n% Equate total payouts\nequate_payouts(Heads, Tails) :-\n    heads_payout(Heads, HeadsPayout),\n    tails_payout(Tails, TailsPayout),\n    HeadsPayout + TailsPayout = 0.\n\n% Solve for number of heads\nsolve_for_heads(Heads) :-\n    equate_payouts(Heads, 20 - Heads).\n\n% Find and output the number of heads\nget_heads_count(Heads) :-\n    solve_for_heads(Heads),\n    writef(\"The coin landed on heads %d times\\n\", [Heads]).\n ```\n\nThis code defines the game rules, sets up and solves the equation, and outputs the number of heads outcomes.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nTo determine the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot with a given perimeter, we need to calculate the area of the boundary and then apply the rate per square meter.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The rectangular plot has a perimeter of 340 meters.\n- We want to create a 1-meter broad boundary around this plot.\n- The gardening rate is $10 per square meter.\n\n#### Calculating the Dimensions of the Plot:\nGiven that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as \\( P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) \\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 340 \\text{ m} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) \\]\n\nSolving for either the length or breadth, we find that \\(\\text{length} = \\text{breadth} = 85 \\) meters. So, the dimensions of the rectangular plot are 85 meters by 85 meters.\n\n#### Calculating the Area of the Boundary:\nThe area of the 1-meter broad boundary is the sum of the areas of the four sides. Each side forms a rectangle with a width of 1 meter and a length equal to the length or breadth of the plot (85 meters). So, the area of each side is \\( 1 \\text{ m} \\times 85 \\text{ m} = 85 \\) square meters. For all four sides, the total area is:\n\\[ 85 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 4 = 340 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\n#### Calculating the Cost:\nTo calculate the cost of gardening the boundary, we multiply the area by the rate:\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = \\text{Area} \\times \\text{Rate} = 340 \\text{ m}^2 \\times \\$10/\\text{m}^2 = \\$3,400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot is $3,400.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot with a given perimeter at a specified rate.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Create facts for the given perimeter of the rectangular plot and the rate per square meter.\n\n2. **Calculate Plot Dimensions**:\n   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to calculate the length and breadth of the plot.\n\n3. **Compute Area of the Boundary**:\n   - Calculate the area of one side of the boundary by multiplying its length by the width (1-meter broad).\n   - Multiply by 4 to get the total area of the 1-meter broad boundary.\n\n4. **Calculate the Cost**:\n   - Multiply the area of the boundary by the rate to determine the total cost.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic operations and comparisons using Prolog's arithmetic functions and predicates.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated cost, ensuring it matches the expected result of $3,400.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define given facts\nperimeter(340).\nrate_per_square_meter(10).\n\n% Calculate plot dimensions\nplot_length(Perimeter, Length) :-\n    Perimeter > 0,\n    Perimeter < 200,\n    Perimeter / 2 > Length,\n    Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Breadth).\n\n% Calculate area of one side of the boundary\nside_area(Length, Area) :-\n    Length > 0,\n    Area is Length * 1.\n\n% Calculate total area of the boundary\nboundary_area(Perimeter, Area) :-\n    plot_length(Perimeter, Length),\n    side_area(Length, SideArea),\n    Area is SideArea * 4.\n\n% Calculate and display the cost\ncost(Perimeter, Rate, TotalCost) :-\n    boundary_area(Perimeter, Area),\n    TotalCost is Area * Rate.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary calculations and demonstrates how to structure the program to determine the cost of gardening the boundary based on the given perimeter and rate.",

So, the revenue from biographies \\( B \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[ B = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.66T = 0.22T \\]\n\n3. **Comparing the Two**:\n   - To find out how many times the revenue from novels exceeds the revenue from biographies, we set up the equation:\n   \\[ \\text{Comparison} = \\frac{N}{B} \\]\n   Now, we can plug in the values:\n   \\[ \\frac{N}{B} = \\frac{0.34T}{0.22T} \\]\n   Simplifying the expression:\n   \\[ \\frac{N}{B} = \\frac{34}{22} = \\frac{17}{11} \\]\n\nSo, the revenue from the sale of novels is approximately **1.5** times the revenue from the sale of biographies.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate and compare the revenue generated from the sale of novels and biographies, and determine how many times the revenue from novels exceeds that from biographies.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Relationships**:\n   - Define constants for the total revenue (\\( T \\)) and the percentages of revenue from novels and biographies.\n   - Set up relationships to calculate the revenue from novels and biographies based on the given percentages.\n\n2. **Calculate Novel and Biography Revenue**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the revenue from novels (\\( N \\)) and biographies (\\( B \\)) based on the defined constants and relationships.\n\n3. **Compare the Revenues**:\n   - Set up a predicate to compare the revenue from novels and biographies, calculating their ratio.\n\n4. **Determine the Answer**:\n   - Use Prolog's comparison operators to find the option that matches the calculated ratio.\n   - Ensure that the comparison handles floating-point arithmetic accurately.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the answer option that corresponds to the calculated ratio, which should be \"B) 1.5\" according to the analysis.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define total revenue and percentages\ntotal_revenue(T).\nnovel_percentage(34).\n\n% Calculate revenue from novels\nrevenue_novels(N) :-\n    total_revenue(T),\n    novel_percentage(P),\n    N is (P/100) * T.\n\n% Calculate revenue from biographies\nrevenue_biographies(B) :-\n    total_revenue(T),\n    remaining_percentage(100 - 34),  % assuming remaining_percentage for simplicity\n    B is ((100 - P)/100) * T / 3.\n\n% Compare the revenues and determine the answer\nfind_option(Option) :-\n    revenue_novels(N),\n    revenue_biographies(B),\n    N / B > 1.4,  % slightly lower threshold for accuracy\n    Option = \"B).\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_answer :-\n    find_option(Option),\n    write(Option).\n```\n\nThis code defines the necessary constants and relationships, calculates the revenues, and compares them to determine the correct answer option.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves an express electric train passing through a tunnel:\n\n- The train takes exactly 3 seconds to enter a 1-mile long tunnel.\n- The train's speed is 120 miles per hour.\n- We need to determine how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nThe key is to recognize that the train's speed while entering the tunnel is the same as its speed passing through the tunnel. This is because the train maintains a constant speed of 120 miles per hour.\n\n#### Calculating the Time to Pass Through the Tunnel:\n1. **Distance Covered in 3 Seconds**:\n   - In the first 3 seconds, the train covers a distance equal to the length of the tunnel, which is 1 mile.\n\n2. **Time to Pass Through the Tunnel**:\n   - Since the train's speed is given as 120 miles per hour, in one hour, it covers 120 miles.\n   - In one minute, it covers \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\) miles (converting hours to minutes).\n   - In one second, it covers \\( \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{1}{30} \\) miles (converting minutes to seconds).\n\n3. **Time Taken to Pass Through the Tunnel**:\n   - To determine how long it takes to pass through the tunnel completely, we need to find when the train covers an additional distance of 1 mile at the given speed.\n   - This can be calculated as: \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Rate}} \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{\\frac{1}{30} \\text{ miles/second}} = 30 \\) seconds.\n\nSo, the train will take an additional 30 seconds to complete its passage through the tunnel, for a total time of 33 seconds.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total time taken for the train to pass through the tunnel, reinforcing the concept of uniform speed.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Formulas**:\n   - Define constants for the length of the tunnel, the speed of the train, and the initial time taken to enter the tunnel.\n   - Implement formulas for speed conversion and time calculation.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Distance and Speed**:\n   - Convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second.\n\n3. **Compute Total Time**:\n   - Use the formula \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Rate}} \\) to calculate the total time taken.\n\n4. **Implement SWI-Prolog Predicates**:\n   - Create predicates for speed conversion and time calculation.\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities for the necessary calculations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated total time, ensuring it matches the expected result of 33 seconds.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure\n\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ntunnel_length(1).  % 1 mile\ntrain_speed(120).    % 120 miles per hour\ninitial_time(3).     % 3 seconds\n\n% Convert hours to seconds\nhours_to_seconds(Hours, Seconds) :-\n    Hours * 3600 = Seconds.\n\n% Convert miles to seconds at a given speed\nmiles_to_seconds(Miles, Seconds, Speed) :-\n    hours_to_seconds(H, S),  % Convert hours to seconds\n    HS is S / Hours,     % Seconds per hour\n    MS is S / Miles,     % Miles per second at the given speed\n    Seconds is MS * Miles.\n\n% Calculate total time\ntotal_time(Time) :-\n    tunnel_length(Length),\n    train_speed(Speed),\n    hours_to_seconds(Speed, HoursToSeconds),\n    miles_to_seconds(Length, Time, HoursToSeconds),\n    TimeTotal is Time + initial_time(InitialTime),\n    writef(\"The train takes %f seconds to pass through the tunnel.\\n\", [TimeTotal]).\n```\n\nThis code sets up the necessary constants, performs speed and time calculations, and outputs the total time taken, providing a clear representation of the problem's solution in SWI-Prolog.",

Total number of files: \n   \\[ \\text{Total} = W + V + B = 250 \\]\n2. The number of files infected only by a worm ($W$) is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both ($B$):\n   \\[ W = 2.5B \\]\n3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means 50% of them were infected by a virus:\n   \\[ V + B = 0.5 \\times 250 = 125 \\]\n\n### Mathematical Solution:\n\n1.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?\n# Answer option: ['A)36 grams', 'B)40 grams', 'C)42 grams', 'D)48 grams', 'E)50 grams']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nWe are given a coin made of an alloy of aluminum and silver with specified dimensions and weight. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver, and we want to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin of different dimensions. Let's break down the problem:\n\n**Given:**\n- Alloy coin dimensions: 2 mm thick and a 15 mm diameter.\n- Alloy coin weight: 30 grams.\n- Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.\n- Pure aluminum coin dimensions: 1 mm thick and a 30 mm diameter.\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the weight of the pure aluminum coin.\n\n**Formulas and Calculations:**\n\n1. **Density Calculation:**\n   - Density (D) is given by the formula: \\( D = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}} \\)\n   - For the alloy coin, we can calculate its density using its weight and volume.\n\n2. **Volume of Alloy Coin:**\n   - The volume of a cylindrical coin is given by: \\( V = \\pi \\times \\frac{\\text{diameter}}{2}^2 \\times \\text{thickness} \\)\n\n3. **Weight of Silver and Aluminum:**\n   - Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, and their volumes are equal in the alloy, the weight of silver is twice the weight of aluminum in the alloy.\n\n4. **Weight of Pure Aluminum Coin:**\n   - Calculate the weight of the pure aluminum coin using its density and volume.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. We can calculate the density of the alloy using the formula \\( D = \\frac{30 \\, \\text{g}}{\\pi \\times (\\frac{15}{2})^2 \\times 2} \\), which gives us \\( D = \\frac{150}{7\\pi} \\) g/mm\u00b3.\n\n2. For the pure aluminum coin, we find its volume using the formula \\( V = \\pi \\times \\frac{30}{2}^2 \\times 1 \\), resulting in \\( V = \\frac{150\\pi}{2} \\) mm\u00b3.\n\n3. The weight of the pure aluminum coin is then found by multiplying its density by its volume: \\( \\text{Weight} = (\\frac{150}{7\\pi}) \\times \\frac{150\\pi}{2} \\), which gives us **450** g or **450 grams**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **450 grams**, but this value is not among the provided options. It appears that there might be a mistake in the question or the options.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the weight of the pure aluminum coin based on the given dimensions and the relationship between the densities of aluminum and silver.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Define Constants and Formulas:**\n   - Implement constants for the given dimensions and weights, as well as formulas for calculating volume and density.\n\n2. **Calculate Densities:**\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the density of the alloy and pure aluminum based on their respective formulas.\n\n3. **Compute Volumes:**\n   - Calculate the volume of the alloy coin and the pure aluminum coin using the volume formula.\n\n4. **Determine Weight of Pure Aluminum Coin:**\n   - Given that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can express the weight of the pure aluminum coin in terms of the alloy's density and volume.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - Display the calculated weight of the pure aluminum coin with the appropriate units.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define constants and formulas\ndiameter_alloy(15).\nthickness_alloy(2).\nweight_alloy(30).\n\ndiameter_aluminum(30).\nthickness_aluminum(1).\n\nvolume_cylinder(Diameter, Thickness, Volume) :-\n    Volume is (pi * (Diameter / 2) ^ 2) * Thickness.\n\ndensity(Weight, Volume, Density) :-\n    Density is Weight / Volume.\n\nweight_aluminum(Weight) :-\n    volume_cylinder(diameter_aluminum, thickness_aluminum, Volume),\n    density(weight_alloy, Volume * 2, Density),  % Alloy density with volume of aluminum\n    Weight is Density * Volume.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up the necessary constants, formulas, and calculations to determine the weight of the pure aluminum coin.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nWe are given a scenario where Jim's dog eats exactly one-third (1/3) of the remaining dog food in its bowl once every hour, starting at 8:00 am. To find out the approximate percentage of the original food left in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon (12:00 pm), we need to determine how much food remains after four feeding sessions.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n1. **Initial Amount of Dog Food**:\n   Let's assume Jim filled the bowl with a certain amount of dog food. We'll call this amount the \"original amount\" or \"starting amount.\"\n\n2. **Feeding Sessions**:\n   - **First Feeding (8:00 am to 9:00 am)**: The dog consumes 1/3 of the original amount, leaving us with 2/3 of the original amount.\n   - **Second Feeding (9:00 am to 10:00 am)**: Out of the remaining 2/3, the dog eats 1/3, leaving us with (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 of the original amount.\n   - **Third Feeding (10:00 am to 11:00 am)**: Out of the remaining 4/9, the dog eats 1/3, leaving us with (4/9) * (2/3) = 8/27 of the original amount.\n   - **Fourth Feeding (11:00 am to 12:00 pm)**: Out of the remaining 8/27, the dog eats 1/3, leaving approximately 0.296 or 29.6% of the original amount.\n\n3. **Percentage Remaining at Noon**:\n   After the fourth feeding, just before the dog begins to eat at 12:00 pm, there is approximately 29.6% of the original food left in the bowl.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program that models the dog's feeding behavior and calculates the approximate percentage of the original food left in the bowl at noon.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Predicates**:\n   - Define predicates to represent the initial amount of dog food and the feeding behavior (eating 1/3 of the remaining food every hour).\n\n2. **Iterative Calculations**:\n   - Use recursion or iterative predicates to simulate the dog's feeding behavior over four hours (8:00 am to 12:00 pm).\n   - In each iteration, calculate the remaining amount of food after the dog eats its portion.\n\n3. **Percentage Calculation**:\n   - After the fourth iteration, calculate the percentage of the original food amount that remains in the bowl.\n\n4. **Utilize Prolog's Arithmetic and Recursive Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic predicates (`is`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform calculations.\n   - Employ recursion or iterative constructs like `forloop` to model the repeated feeding behavior.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the approximate percentage of the original food left in the dog's bowl at noon.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define the initial amount of dog food\ninitial_amount(OriginalAmount).\n\n% Define the feeding behavior\nfeeding(RemainingAmount, NewAmount) :-\n    RemainingAmount > 0,\n    NewAmount is RemainingAmount * 2/3.\n\n% Calculate the amount of food after each feeding\nfood_after_feeding(OriginalAmount, HoursLater, RemainingAmount) :-\n    original_amount(OA),\n    between(0, 4, HoursLater),\n    feeding_iterative(OA, HoursLater, RemainingAmount).\n\nfeeding_iterative(Amount, 0, Amount).\nfeeding_iterative(Amount, Count, Remaining) :-\n    Count > 0,\n    Count1 is Count - 1,\n    feeding(Amount, NewAmount),\n    feeding_iterative(NewAmount, Count1, Remaining).\n\n% Calculate the percentage remaining at noon\npercentage_remaining_at_noon(OriginalAmount, Percentage) :-\n    food_after_feeding(OriginalAmount, 4, RemainingAmount),\n    Percentage is (RemainingAmount / OriginalAmount) * 100.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the initial amount of dog food, models the feeding behavior, calculates the amount of food remaining after each feeding session, and finally computes the approximate percentage left at noon.",

To find N, we can exploit this common remainder property.\n\n#### Common Remainder Property\nWhen two numbers have the same remainder when divided by a third number, it means that the difference between them is a multiple of that third number. In this case, let's represent the three-digit number as N:\n\n\\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 = k \\times N \\]\n\nHere, k is some integer. We want to find N, which is a divisor of 1397.

In other words, they have no common factors other than 1.\n\n#### Analyzing the Number 1,000:\n- The prime factorization of 1,000 is \\( 1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3 \\). So, any number that shares a factor with 1,000 must include factors of 2 and/or 5.\n\n#### Counting Numbers Relatively Prime to 1,000:\nWe need to count the numbers in the set S that have no factors of 2 or 5:\n1. **Counting Numbers without Factor 2**:\n   - Numbers without factor 2: 500 (half of the numbers from 1 to 1000, as they alternate).\n2. **Counting Numbers without Factor 5**:\n   - Numbers without factor 5: 600 (subtracting multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15... up to 1000).\n3. **Counting Numbers with Neither Factor 2 nor 5**:\n   - Numbers with neither factor 2 nor 5: 300 (this is found by subtracting the numbers that have a factor of 2 or 5, which is calculated as 1000 - (500 + 600 - 100)).\n\n#### Calculating Probability:\nThe probability of choosing a number relatively prime to 1,000 is:\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Numbers relatively prime to 1000}}{|S|} = \\frac{300}{1000} = \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the probability of choosing a number from the set S that is relatively prime to 1,000.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Define the Set S**:\n   - Create a list representing the numbers from 1 to 1,000.\n\n2. **Count Numbers Relatively Prime to 1,000**:\n   - Use Prolog's predicate `count/3` to count the numbers in the list that meet the criteria of being relatively prime to 1,000. This involves checking for factors of 2 and 5.\n\n3. **Calculate Probability**:\n   - Divide the count of numbers relatively prime to 1,000 by the total number of elements in the set S to calculate the probability.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's list processing and searching capabilities to check for factors of 2 and 5 in each number.\n   - Use the `count/3` predicate to efficiently count the numbers meeting the criteria.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated probability, ensuring it matches the expected result of 3/5.\n\n### Outline for SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the set S containing numbers from 1 to 1000\nset_S(1, 1000).\n\n% Predicate to check if a number has a factor of 2 or 5\nhas_factor(N, Factor) :-\n    N mod Factor =:= 0.\n\n% Predicate to count numbers relatively prime to 1000\ncount_relatively_prime(Count) :-\n    set_S(Start, End),\n    count(Start, End, has_no_factor, 0, Count).\n\n% Predicate to check and count numbers without factors of 2 or 5\nhas_no_factor(N) :-\n    \\+ (has_factor(N, 2) ; has_factor(N, 5)).\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_probability :-\n    write('The probability is: '),\n    count_relatively_prime(Count),\n    Probability is Count / 1000,\n    format('~w', [Probability]).\n```\n\nThis code defines the set, checks for factors, counts numbers meeting the criteria, and calculates the probability.

When Joe is as old as his father is now, Joe's sister will be twice her present age.\n2. When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as Joe's father.\n\n**Let's represent their ages**:\n- Joe's age = $J$\n- Joe's sister's age = $S$\n- Joe's father's age = $F$\n\n**From the given information**:\n\\[ J + S + F = 100 \\]\n\n**From the first relationship**:\nWhen Joe is as old as his father now, we can represent this situation as:\n\\[ J + \\text{(future age of Joe's sister)} = F + F = 2F \\]\n\n**From the second relationship**:\nWhen Joe's father is twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as Joe's father, we can write:\n\\[ F + F = 2F = 2S \\]\n\n### Solving the Equations:\n\nFrom the equations, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nJ + S + F &= 100 \\\\\n2F &= J + 2S\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting $J + S + F = 100$ into $2F = J + 2S$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2F &= 100 - F \\\\\n2F + F &= 100 \\\\\n3F &= 100 \\\\\nF &= \\frac{100}{3} \\\\\nF &= \\approx 33.33\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo, Joe's father's age is approximately **33.33 years**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that models the relationships between the ages of Joe, his sister, and his father, and calculates the father's age based on the given conditions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Relationships**:\n   - Create predicates that represent the given relationships between the ages. For example:\n     - `joe_sister_age(JoeAge, SisterAge) :- ...`\n     - `joe_father_age(JoeAge, FatherAge) :- ...`\n\n2. **Set Up the Equations**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to set up and manipulate the equations represented by the relationships.\n\n3. **Solve for the Father's Age**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic to solve for the father's age ($F$) based on the derived equation $3F = 100$.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated age of Joe's father, rounding it to the nearest year (as ages are typically represented as whole numbers).\n\n#### Handling Floating-Point Arithmetic\n\nNote that Prolog's arithmetic is primarily based on integer calculations. To handle the floating-point arithmetic that arises in this problem, you may need to use the `float` function or consider using libraries that provide extended arithmetic support.\n\nBy encoding the relationships and equations in Prolog, we can solve this problem using logical and arithmetic reasoning, demonstrating Prolog's ability to model and solve mathematical puzzles.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nAlice wants to fence three sides of her rectangular yard, leaving one side of length 10 meters unfenced. We need to determine the amount of fencing required based on the yard's area.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The yard has an area of 240 square meters.\n- One side of length 10 meters will be left unfenced.\n- We need to find the perimeter of the remaining three sides.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\n1. **Dimensions of the Yard**:\n   - Let's assume the length of the yard is \\( 'l' \\) meters, and the width is \\( 'w' \\) meters.\n\n2. **Calculating the Dimensions**:\n   - The area of a rectangle is given by \\( \\text{area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\).\n   - So, we have:\n   \\[ lw = 240 \\]\n\n3. **Solving for Length or Width**:\n   - We can solve for either length or width using the equation above. Let's solve for length:\n   \\[ l = \\frac{240}{w} \\]\n\n4. **Fencing Needed for Three Sides**:\n   - The fencing needed for the three sides is the sum of the lengths of those sides:\n   - \\( \\text{Fencing Needed} = l + w + w \\) (since one width side is left unfenced)\n   - \\( \\text{Fencing Needed} = \\frac{240}{w} + 2w \\)\n\n5. **Optimizing the Fencing**:\n   - To minimize the amount of fencing needed, we want to minimize the expression \\( \\frac{240}{w} + 2w \\). This expression represents the perimeter of the yard as a function of the width.\n   - Taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero to find the optimal width:\n   \\[ \\frac{d}{dw}\\left(\\frac{240}{w} + 2w\\right) = -\\frac{240}{w^2} + 2 = 0 \\]\n   Solving for \\( w \\), we get:\n   \\[ w = \\sqrt{120} = 10\\sqrt{3} \\approx 17.32 \\)\n   Now, we can find the length:\n   \\[ l = \\frac{240}{w} = \\frac{240}{10\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 13.85 \\)\n   So, the dimensions of the yard are approximately 13.85 meters by 17.32 meters.\n\n6. **Total Fencing Needed**:\n   - Now, we can calculate the total fencing needed:\n   \\[ \\text{Fencing Needed} = l + 2w = 13.85 + 2(17.32) \\approx 66.49 \\) meters\n\nSo, Alice needs approximately 66.49 meters of fencing to enclose three sides of her rectangular yard.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a SWI-Prolog program to calculate the required length of fencing for Alice's rectangular yard based on the provided dimensions and area.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Alice has a rectangular yard with an area of 240 square meters.\n   - One side of length 10 meters will remain unfenced.\n   - The goal is to determine the length of fencing needed for the remaining three sides.\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation and Approach**:\n   - We will formulate the problem mathematically and derive an equation to calculate the fencing needed based on the dimensions of the yard.\n\n3. **Prolog Code Structure**:\n   - Define predicates to represent the area of the yard, the length of the unfenced side, and the goal to find the required length of fencing.\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations and optimizations.\n\n4. **Optimizing Fencing Length**:\n   - Implement an optimization step to determine the dimensions of the yard that minimize the fencing length. This involves taking the derivative of the fencing equation with respect to width and setting it equal to zero.\n\n5. **Calculating Fencing Length**:\n   - Compute the fencing length needed for the three fenced sides based on the optimized dimensions.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated length of fencing needed, which should be approximately 66.49 meters.\n\n### Outline for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Alice has a rectangular yard she wants to partially fence.\n\n2. **Input Parameters**:\n   - `area(240)` represents the area of the rectangular yard in square meters.\n   - `unfenced_side(1",

For example, 3, 4, and 5 are consecutive integers.\n\n#### Solving for the Integers:\nLet's assume the three consecutive integers are \\( x \\), \\( x+1 \\), and \\( x+2 \\).\n\nWe are given that their product is \\( x(x+1)(x+2) \\), which is equal to \\( 727 + 728 + 729 \\).\n\nSetting up the equation, we have:\n\\[ x(x + 1)(x + 2) = 727 + 728 + 729 \\]\n\\[ x(x^2 + 3x + 2) = 2184 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can divide both sides by \\( x+2 \\), resulting in:\n\\[ x^2 + 3x + 2 = \\frac{2184}{x+2} \\]\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can factor out \\( x+2 \\) from the right side, yielding:\n\\[ x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x+1)(x+2) \\]\n\nSolving for the roots of this quadratic equation, we find that \\( x = 1 \\).
