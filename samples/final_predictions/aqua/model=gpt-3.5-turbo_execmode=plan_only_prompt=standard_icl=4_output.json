This step involves listing all permutations and then counting them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Implement efficient search through the space of all permutations of the provided letters.\n   - Use the `findall` predicate to gather all permutations and the `length` predicate to count them, ensuring we get the factorial number as calculated analytically.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of permutations, verifying that it matches \\( 7! = 5040 \\).\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling lists and permutations efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem.
