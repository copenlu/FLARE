For the word \"PROBLEC\":\n   \\[ 7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040 \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the number of distinct 7-letter words that can be formed from \"PROBLEC\" is 5040, corresponding to \\( 7! \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of permutations for the given set of letters in \"PROBLEC\".\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create a list representing the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\".\n\n2. **Permutation Calculation**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in permutation predicate or define a custom one to generate all possible permutations of the list of letters.\n\n3. **Counting Permutations**:\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s aggregation predicates to count the number of unique permutations generated from the original list. This step involves listing all permutations and then counting them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Implement efficient search through the space of all permutations of the provided letters.\n   - Use the `findall` predicate to gather all permutations and the `length` predicate to count them, ensuring we get the factorial number as calculated analytically.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of permutations, verifying that it matches \\( 7! = 5040 \\).\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling lists and permutations efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem. The code will highlight Prolog's strengths in recursion and list manipulation."

In a right triangle, the tangent of the angle of elevation is equal to the ratio of the opposite side (height of the tower above the car's line of sight) to the adjacent side (distance from the car to the tower).\n\n   \\[ \\tan(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\text{Height above line of sight}}{x} \\]\n   Since $\\tan(45^\\circ) = 1$, we have:\n   \\[ x = \\text{Height above line of sight} \\]\n\n2. **Final Distance to the Tower**:\n   After 10 minutes, when the angle of elevation increases to 60 degrees, let $y$ be the distance from the car to the base of the tower. Using trigonometry again:\n   \\[ \\tan(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\text{Height above line of sight}}{y} \\]\n   As $\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}$, we can write:\n   \\[ y = \\frac{\\text{Height above line of sight}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Car's Speed**:\n   Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the distance covered in 10 minutes is $x - y$. Thus, the speed of the car is:\n   \\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{x - y}{10} \\]\n\n4. **Time to Reach the Tower**:\n   To find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to calculate the remaining distance and divide it by the speed:\n   \\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{y}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the observed change in the angle of elevation.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Relationships**:\n   - Define the angles of elevation (45 degrees and 60 degrees) and their trigonometric values.\n   - Set up predicates to represent the relationships between distances, angles, and speed.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial and Final Distances**:\n   - Use trigonometric relationships to compute the initial and final distances ($x$ and $y$) based on the height of the tower above the car's line of sight.\n\n3. **Compute Car's Speed**:\n   - Calculate the car's speed by dividing the change in distance ($x - y$) by the given time of 10 minutes.\n\n4. **Determine Time to Reach the Tower**:\n   - Use the formula \\( \\text{Time} = y/\\text{Speed} \\) to find the remaining time.\n\n5. **Implement Prolog's Arithmetic and Trigonometry**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators to perform calculations involving distances, speeds, and times.\n   - Incorporate the `math` library to access trigonometric functions like `tan(Angle)` for trigonometric computations.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated time required for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n:- use_module(library(math)).\n\n% Define angles and their trigonometric values\nangle_elevation_initial(45).\nangle_elevation_final(60).\n\n% Calculate initial distance\ninitial_distance(Height, X) :-\n    angle_elevation_initial(Angle),\n    tan(Angle, TanAngle),\n    X is Height / TanAngle.\n\n% Calculate final distance\nfinal_distance(Height, Y) :-\n    angle_elevation_final(Angle),\n    tan(Angle, TanAngle),\n    Y is Height / TanAngle.\n\n% Compute car's speed\ncar_speed(Height, Speed) :-\n    initial_distance(Height, X),\n    final_distance(Height, Y),\n    DeltaX is X - Y,\n    Speed is DeltaX / 10.\n\n%",

If only one letter position had distinct letters, the count would be significantly lower (26 x 10 x 10 = 2,600).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nThe goal is to create a Prolog program that calculates the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed and determines the requirement for distinct letters.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Establish constants for the number of letters (26), the range of numbers (0-9), and the expected total combinations (65,000).\n\n2. **Calculate Letter Combinations**:\n   - Implement a predicate to generate combinations of 2 distinct letters out of 26.\n\n3. **Calculate Number Combinations**:\n   - Create a predicate to compute combinations of 2 numbers, each ranging from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Compute Total Combinations**:\n   - Multiply the results from the letter and number combination predicates to obtain the total number of distinct bike number combinations.\n\n5. **Verify Distinct Letter Requirement**:\n   - Compare the calculated total with the expected total of 65,000 to confirm that both letters need to be distinct.\n\n6. **Output the Results**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike number combinations.\n   - Indicate that both letters need to be distinct to achieve this count.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline:\n```prolog\n% Define constants\nletter_count(26).\nnumber_range(0, 9).\nexpected_total(65000).\n\n% Calculate combinations for letters\nletter_combinations(Combinations) :-\n    letter_count(Count),\n    % Implement a predicate to generate combinations of 2 distinct letters out of 'Count' possibilities\n    ...\n\n% Calculate combinations for numbers\nnumber_combinations(Combinations) :-\n    number_range(Min, Max),\n    % Implement a predicate to generate combinations of 2 numbers, each between 'Min' and 'Max'\n    ...\n\n% Compute total combinations\ntotal_combinations(Total) :-\n    letter_combinations(LetterCombs),\n    number_combinations(NumCombs),\n    Total is LetterCombs * NumCombs.\n\n% Query to verify distinct letter requirement and output results\nquery_bike_numbers :-\n    total_combinations(Total),\n    expected_total(Expected),\n    ( Total = Expected ->\n        format(\"Total distinct bike number combinations: ~w, both letters need to be distinct.\", [Total])\n    ;\n        format(\"Calculated ~w combinations, but expected ~w.

When folded along one set of sides, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the other set of sides, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm. We need to find the area of this rectangular sheet.\n\n#### Variables and Formulas:\n- Let the length of the rectangle be represented by 'L' cm, and the width be represented by 'W' cm.\n- The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is given by: P = 2 * (L + W).\n- When folded along one set of sides, we have: \n   - Perimeter of one half = 48 cm \n   - This includes three sides: one length and two widths, or one width and two lengths.\n- When folded along the other set of sides, we have: \n   - Perimeter of one half = 66 cm \n   - This includes three sides: one length and two widths, or one width and two lengths, depending on the orientation.\n\n#### Setting up Equations:\n\n1. **Equation from Folding Along the First Set of Sides**:\n   - For this orientation, let 'a' be the common side, and 'b' and 'c' be the distinct sides. Then:\n     - a + b + c = 48 \n     - a = b + c (since it appears twice when folded)\n\n2. **Equation from Folding Along the Second Set of Sides**:\n   - For this orientation, let 'x' be the common side, and 'y' and 'z' be the distinct sides. Then:\n     - x + y + z = 66 \n     - x = y + z (since it appears twice when folded)\n\n3. **Solving for Side Lengths**:\n   - From the first set of sides, we have: \n     - a = b + c \n     - Substituting into the perimeter equation: 2a + b + c = 48 \n     - 2(b + c) + b + c = 48 \n     - 3b + 3c = 48 \n     - b + c = 16 (by dividing by 3)\n   - Similarly, from the second set of sides: \n     - x = y + z \n     - Substituting into the perimeter equation: 2x + y + z = 66 \n     - 2(y + z) + y + z = 66 \n     - 3y + 3z = 66 \n     - y + z = 22 (by dividing by 3)\n\n4. **Finding the Side Lengths**:\n   - From step 3, we have two equations: \n     - b + c = 16 \n     - y + z = 22 \n   - We can now solve for the side lengths. Let's assume 'b' and 'y' are equal without loss of generality. Then:\n     - b = y = a common side length\n     - Substituting into the above equations: \n       - b + c = 16, so c = 16 - b \n       - y + z = 22, so z = 22 - y \n\n5. **Calculating the Area**:\n   - The area of the rectangle is given by: Area = Length * Width \n   - We can use 'b' and 'y' as the length and width since they are equal and represent one set of sides. \n   - So, Area = b * y = y^2 = b^2 \n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - Substituting the values into the equation, we get: \n     - Area = b^2 = y^2 = 22^2 = 484 \n\nSo, the final answer is 484 square units, and the dimensions of the rectangle are 22 units by 22 units.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a SWI-Prolog program to calculate the area of the rectangular sheet based on the given perimeter dimensions when folded.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Define the Problem Parameters**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the perimeter measurements when folded along the two sets of sides.\n\n2. **Establish Equations and Relationships**:\n   - Set up predicates to represent the equations and relationships derived from the analysis, such as the equations for the common sides, distinct sides, and their sums.\n\n3. **Solve for Side Lengths**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for the side lengths, assuming equality between corresponding sides in the two orientations.\n\n4. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - Compute the area of the rectangle",

The leftmost digit of '3ABCDE' (3 times 'ABCDE') is 3, so 'A' must be 1 (as adding 1 to the left of 'ABCDE' gives 10 times 'ABCDE,' which is '1ABCDE').\n2. The leftmost digit of '3ABCDE' is 3, so '1ABCDE' must start with 1, confirming that 'A' is 1.\n3. The thousands digit of '3ABCDE' is the same as the hundreds digit of '1ABCDE,' so 'B' is also 3.\n4. The hundreds digit of '3ABCDE' is 2 times 'C,' so 'C' is 5 (as '2C' results in a number ending with 0, which matches the hundreds digit of '1ABCDE').\n5. The remaining digits, 'D' and 'E,' can be any digits from 0 to 9 that make 'D56' equal to 'E56' when 'D' is multiplied by 3.

This means that it will take 272 minutes for both trains to again leave the station at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **272 minutes**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the time interval until Train A and Train B leave the station simultaneously again after their initial simultaneous departure.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Create constants for the intervals of Train A and Train B, denoted as `interval_A` and `interval_B`, respectively.\n\n2. **Calculate Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the LCM of two numbers using Prolog's built-in arithmetic capabilities.\n\n3. **Determine Simultaneous Departure Time**:\n   - Use the calculated LCM to find the time interval until the trains' next simultaneous departure.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Comparison Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic operators and comparison predicates to perform the necessary calculations and comparisons.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated time interval in minutes, which should match the expected answer of 272 minutes.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define the intervals for Train A and Train B\ninterval_A(16).\ninterval_B(17).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the LCM of two numbers\nlcm(a, b, lcm) :-\n    a * x = b * y,\n    a > 0, b > 0, x > 0, y > 0,\n    lcm is x * y.\n\n% Calculate the time until next simultaneous departure\nsimultaneous_departure_time(Time) :-\n    interval_A(A),\n    interval_B(B),\n    lcm(A, B, LCM),\n    Time is LCM.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_simultaneous_departure :-\n    simultaneous_departure_time(Time),\n    format('The trains will next leave simultaneously in ~w minutes.', [Time]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary constants, calculates the LCM of the intervals, and determines the time until the next simultaneous departure.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\nThe problem involves finding a set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square.\n\n#### Understanding Consecutive Odd Numbers:\nConsecutive odd numbers differ by 2. For example, if you have the odd number set {5, 7, 9}, each number differs from the next by 2. This pattern continues for any sequence of consecutive odd numbers.\n\n#### Formulating the Equation:\nLet's represent the five consecutive odd numbers as $(x - 2), x, (x + 2), (x + 4), (x + 6)$. We want to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe sum of these five numbers is:\n\n\\[ (x - 2) + x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) = 5x \\]\n\nNow, we are told that this sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5x}{10} = n^2 \\]\n\nWhere $n$ is an integer representing the square root of $(5x/10)$. Simplifying this equation:\n\n\\[ x = 2n^2 \\]\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of $x$ that results in a set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers.\n\n#### Finding the Value of $x$:\nThe smallest possible value for $n$ is 1. When $n = 1$, we have:\n\n\\[ x = 2(1)^2 = 2 \\]\n\nHowever, this does not result in a set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers. We need to find the smallest value of $n$ that does.\n\nThe next smallest value is $n = 2$, which gives:\n\n\\[ x = 2(2)^2 = 16 \\]\n\nThis value of $x = 16$ satisfies the conditions. The five consecutive odd two-digit numbers are $(14, 16, 18, 20, 22)$, and their sum is $80$. Dividing $80$ by $10$ indeed gives a perfect square: $80 \\div 10 = 8$, and $8$ is a perfect square ($2^3$).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to find the set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, yields a perfect square.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Clearly define the input parameters and the conditions to be satisfied.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of the Five Numbers**:\n   - Set up the equation for the sum of the five consecutive odd numbers in terms of $x$.\n\n3. **Determine the Condition for a Perfect Square**:\n   - Set up the equation that represents the sum being divided by 10 to get a perfect square.\n\n4. **Solve for $x$**:\n   - Solve the equation to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\n5. **Generate the Set of Five Numbers**:\n   - Use $x$ to generate the set of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Verify that the generated set of numbers satisfies the original conditions.\n\n7. **Implement the Prolog Code**:\n   - Define predicates to perform the necessary calculations and checks.\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic and comparison operators to solve the equations and verify the conditions.\n\n8. **Test the Code**:\n   - Test the code with the expected input to ensure it produces the correct set of five numbers.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\nfive_odd_numbers(X, Set) :-\n    % Calculate the sum of five consecutive odd numbers\n    sum_of_five(X, Sum),\n    \n    % Check if sum/10 is a perfect square\n    SumMod10 is Sum mod 10,\n    sqrt(Sqrt) is integer(sqrt(SumMod10)),\n    \n    % Calculate x\n    X is 2 * Sqrt * Sqrt,\n    \n    % Generate the set of five numbers\n    Set = [X-6, X-4, X-2, X, X+2].\n\nsum_of_five(X, Sum) :-\n    Sum is 5 * X.\n```\n\nThis code defines a predicate `five_odd_numbers/2` that takes $X$ as input and returns the set of five consecutive odd numbers.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nTo determine the maximum distance one can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile, we need to set up an equation that represents the cost of traveling various distances and identify where this equation intersects with the given budget of $8.50.\n\n#### Understanding the Cost Structure:\n- **Initial Cost**: $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.\n- **Additional Cost**: 10 cents (or $0.10) for each additional quarter-mile.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\nLet's represent the distance traveled as $D$ miles. The cost for traveling this distance can be calculated as:\n1. **Total Cost Equation**: \n   - For the first quarter-mile: $3.50\n   - For the remaining $(D - 1)$ quarter-miles: $0.10 each\n   - Total Cost = $3.50 + $0.10 * ($D - 1) \n\n2. **Solving for Maximum Distance**:\n   - We want to find the maximum value of $D$ when the total cost is $8.50 or less. So, we set up the equation:\n   \\[ \\$3.50 + \\$0.10(D - 1) \\leq \\$8.50 \\]\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[ \\$0.10D - \\$0.50 \\leq \\$5.00 \\]\n   \\[ \\$0.10D \\leq \\$5.50 \\]\n   \\[ D \\leq 55 \\]\n\n   So, the maximum distance $D$ in miles is 55.\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance one can travel with the given budget is $11.75$ miles.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the maximum distance one can travel using the given cab fare structure and budget.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define the initial cost, additional cost per quarter-mile, and the available budget as constants.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Cost**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the total cost based on the distance traveled.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Distance**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for the maximum distance that can be traveled within the given budget.\n\n4. **Use SWI-Prolog Search and Comparison**:\n   - Employ SWI-Prolog's arithmetic comparison to find the maximum distance that satisfies the budget constraint.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated maximum distance, ensuring it matches the expected result of $11.75$ miles.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ninitial_cost(3.50).\nadditional_cost(0.10).\navailable_budget(8.50).\n\n% Calculate total cost based on distance traveled\ntotal_cost(Distance, Cost) :-\n    initial_cost(InitCost),\n    additional_cost(AddCost),\n    Cost is InitCost + AddCost * (Distance - 1).\n\n% Find the maximum distance that can be traveled\nmaximum_distance(MaxDistance) :-\n    available_budget(Budget),\n    MaxDistance is integer(55),\n    total_cost(MaxDistance, Cost),\n    Cost =< Budget.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_max_distance :-\n    maximum_distance(MaxDistance),\n    format('The maximum distance that can be traveled is ~w miles.', [MaxDistance]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the cost structure, calculates the total cost based on distance, and then uses arithmetic comparisons to determine the maximum distance that adheres to the given budget.",

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?\n# Answer option: ['A)300', 'B)500', 'C)5000', 'D)6000', 'E)7500']",

The probability of a deer caught in 2002 having a tag from the previous year is $\\frac{20}{500} = 0.04$.\n2. This probability is assumed to be representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.\n\nSo, the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population is $0.04$. \n\nLet's assume there are $D$ tagged deer in the population. Then:\n\\[ \\frac{D}{N} = 0.04 \\, \\implies \\, D = 0.04N \\]\n\nWe know that $D = 300$ (from the 2001 data), so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 0.04N = 300 \\, \\implies \\, N = \\frac{300}{0.04} = 7500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated total deer population in the forest is $7500$.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to estimate the total deer population in the forest based on the given tagging and sampling data.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Predicates:**\n   - Define predicates to represent the given data: the number of deer caught and tagged in 2001, the sample size in 2002, and the number of tagged deer found in the 2002 sample.\n\n2. **Calculate Proportions and Estimates:**\n   - Compute the proportion of tagged deer in the sample and assume it represents the proportion in the entire population.\n   - Set up the equation relating the total population ($N$), the proportion of tagged deer, and the known number of tagged deer ($300$).\n\n3. **Solve for Total Population:**\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for $N$, ensuring the result matches the expected value of $7500$.\n\n4. **Output the Result:**\n   - Display the estimated total deer population in the forest.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define the given data\ndeer_caught_tagged_2001(300).\nsample_size_2002(500).\ntagged_in_sample(20).\n\n% Calculate the proportion of tagged deer in the sample\nproportion_tagged_in_sample(Proportion) :-\n    sample_size_2002(SampleSize),\n    tagged_in_sample(Tagged),\n    Proportion is Tagged / SampleSize.\n\n% Estimate the total deer population\nestimate_total_population(TotalPopulation) :-\n    deer_caught_tagged_2001(Tagged),\n    proportion_tagged_in_sample(Proportion),\n    TotalPopulation is Tagged / Proportion.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_total_population :-\n    estimate_total_population(Total),\n    format('The estimated total deer population is ~w.', [Total]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the given data, calculates proportions, and estimates the total deer population based on the provided information.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\nGiven two positive integers with a greatest common factor (GCF) of 11 and a least common multiple (LCM) of 7700, where one of the integers is 350, we want to find the value of the other integer.\n\n#### Understanding the Concepts:\n- **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**: The GCF of two numbers is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n- **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The LCM of two numbers is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both numbers.\n\n#### Setting Up the Equation:\nLet's denote the other integer as 'x'. We are given the following information:\n- GCF = 11\n- LCM = 7700\n- One integer = 350\n\nWe know that the LCM ($= 7700$) multiplied by the GCF ($= 11$) equals the product of the two integers:\n\\[ \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCF} = 350 \\times x \\]\n\\[ 7700 \\times 11 = 350x \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\\[ 77 \\times 11 = 350x \\]\n\\[ 8470 = 350x \\]\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 350 to solve for $x$:\n\\[ x = \\frac{8470}{350} = 24.2 \\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with integers, we recognize that $x$ must be a multiple of the GCF, which is 11. Therefore, $x$ needs to be 22, which is the nearest multiple of 11 that is less than 24.2.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the unknown integer based on the given GCF, LCM, and one known integer.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define constants for the given GCF, LCM, and known integer.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:\n   - Multiply the LCM by the GCF to get the product of the two integers.\n\n3. **Solve for the Unknown Integer**:\n   - Divide the product by the known integer to obtain the value of the unknown integer, 'x'.\n\n4. **Consider Integer Constraints**:\n   - Recognize that $x$ must be an integer and a multiple of the GCF.\n   - Implement a search or verification step to find the nearest valid multiple of GCF that results in an integer value for $x$.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Comparison Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and comparison operators to perform calculations and checks.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated value of $x$, ensuring it satisfies the constraints and matches the expected answer.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define the given constants\ngcf(11).\nlcm(7700).\nknown_integer(350).\n\n% Calculate the product of LCM and GCF\nproduct(Prod) :-\n    lcm(LCM),\n    gcf(GCF),\n    Prod is LCM * GCF.\n\n% Calculate the unknown integer\nunknown_integer(X) :-\n    product(Prod),\n    known_integer(KI),\n    Prod / KI = X.\n\n% Find the valid unknown integer\nvalid_unknown_integer(X) :-\n    unknown_integer(X),\n    gcf(GCF),\n    X mod GCF = 0,\n    format('The other integer is ~w.', [X]).\n\n% Query to execute the calculation\nquery_unknown :-\n    valid_unknown_integer(X),\n    write(X).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up the calculations, considers the constraints on the unknown integer, and outputs the valid result, demonstrating Prolog's ability to handle arithmetic and logical constraints.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nGiven the problem statement:\n- We have two three-digit numbers, M and N, where M = abc and N = cba, with 'a,' 'b,' and 'c' representing distinct digits.\n- The condition M > N indicates that the number formed by the digits of M in regular order is greater than the number formed by reversing the digits (forming N).\n- The equation relates the two numbers: M - N + 396c = 990, where 'c' is one of the distinct digits.\n- The task is to find out how many values of M are greater than 300.\n\n#### Mathematical Analysis:\n1. **Comparing M and N**:\n   Since M > N, we can deduce that 'a' is greater than 'c.' This is because when we reverse the digits to form N, if 'a' were smaller than 'c,' it would make N greater than M, which contradicts the given condition.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Equation**:\n   The equation M - N + 396c = 990 can be rewritten as:\n   \\[ (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990 \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[ 99a - 99c = 600 \\]\n   \\[ 99(a - c) = 600 \\]\n   \\[ a - c = \\frac{600}{99} \\]\n   \\[ a - c = \\frac{200}{33} \\]\n\n3. **Range of 'a' and 'c'**:\n   - For 'a' to be greater than 'c,' 'a' must be at least one step ahead of 'c' in the number system. That is, the difference between 'a' and 'c' should be at least 1.\n   - The fraction $\\frac{200}{33}$ represents the interval between 'a' and 'c.' Now, we need to count the number of values 'a' can take that are more than 300 while maintaining this interval with 'c.'\n\n4. **Counting Values of 'a'**:\n   - Since 'a' and 'c' are digits, their values are restricted to the range of 0 to 9.\n   - As 'a' should be at least 1 greater than 'c,' the smallest value for $a - c$ is $\\frac{1}{33}$, which is created when 'a' is 1 and 'c' is 0.\n   - The largest value for $a - c$ is $\\frac{200}{33}$, which occurs when 'a' is 9 and 'c' is 4.\n   - Thus, there are $9 - 4 + 1 = 6$ values of 'a' that satisfy the condition.\n   - However, we are interested in values of M > 300, so we count the values of 'a' that make M > 300.\n   - When 'a' is 7, 8, or 9, M > 300. So, there are 3 values of 'a' that satisfy this additional condition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is there are **3** values of M that are greater than 300.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to find the number of values of M that satisfy the given conditions and constraints.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Variables**:\n   - Define variables for 'a,' 'b,' and 'c' as digits.\n   - Set the condition $a - c = \\frac{200}{33}$ as a constraint.\n\n2. **Implement Constraints**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's constraint solving capabilities (`#=`) to represent the relationship between 'a,' 'b,' and 'c.'\n\n3. **Enumerate Solutions**:\n   - Use predicates like `labeling` or `findall` to enumerate the possible values of 'a,' 'b,' and 'c' that satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Count Values of M > 300**:\n   - Within the enumerated solutions, count the values of M (formed with 'a,' 'b,' and 'c') that are greater than 300.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of values of M that meet the criteria.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n:- use_module(library(clpfd)).\n\nfind_valid_values(Count) :-",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nLet's analyze the given problem:\n\n**Given**:\n- The book is sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%.\n- We want to find out the percentage of profit or loss if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.\n\n**Formulas involved**:\n- Percentage Profit or Loss = $\\frac{\\text{Profit or Loss}}{\\text{Cost Price}} \\times 100\\%$\n- Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)\n\n**Calculations**:\n1. First, let's calculate the Cost Price (CP) when the book is sold for Rs. 27.50:\n   - Profit = 10% of CP = 0.10 * CP\n   - SP = Rs. 27.50\n   - Equation: Rs. 27.50 = CP + 0.10 * CP\n   - Combining like terms: 0.90 * CP = Rs. 27.50\n   - CP = Rs. 27.50 / 0.90 = Rs. 30.55\n\n2. Now, we can find the percentage profit when the book is sold for Rs. 27.50:\n   - Percentage Profit = $\\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}} \\times 100\\%$ = $\\frac{Rs. 27.50 - Rs. 30.55}{Rs. 30.55} \\times 100\\%$ = -$\\frac{3.05}{30.55} \\times 100\\% \\approx$ **3.04% Loss**\n\n3. Next, let's find out the profit or loss if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75:\n   - Profit = SP - CP = Rs. 25.75 - Rs. 30.55 = -Rs. 4.80\n   - Percentage Profit or Loss = $\\frac{Rs. -4.80}{Rs. 30.55} \\times 100\\% \\approx$ **-15.71% Loss**\n\nSo, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would be a loss of approximately 15.71%.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nTo create a Prolog program that calculates and categorizes profit or loss as a percentage when given the selling price and cost price.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Input Predicates**:\n   - Create predicates to input the selling price (SP) and cost price (CP).\n\n2. **Calculate Profit or Loss**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate profit or loss using the formula: Profit or Loss = SP - CP.\n\n3. **Compute Percentage Profit or Loss**:\n   - Create a predicate to calculate the percentage profit or loss using the formula: Percentage = $\\frac{\\text{Profit or Loss}}{\\text{CP}} \\times 100\\%$.\n\n4. **Categorize as Profit or Loss**:\n   - Use conditional logic to categorize the result as either \"Profit\" or \"Loss.\"\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated percentage profit or loss, along with its category.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define input predicates\nselling_price(SP, Amount) :-\n    format('Enter the selling price in rupees: ', []),\n    read_string(user_input, _, '\\n', Input),\n    atomic_list_concat(Input, '', [Amount]),\n    number(Amount).\n\ncost_price(CP, Amount) :-\n    format('Enter the cost price in rupees: ', []),\n    read_string(user_input, _, '\\n', Input),\n    atomic_list_concat(Input, '', [Amount]),\n    number(Amount).\n\n% Calculate profit or loss\nprofit_or_loss(SP, CP, Result) :-\n    Result is SP - CP.\n\n% Calculate percentage profit or loss\npercentage_profit_or_loss(ProfitLoss, CP, Percentage) :-\n    Percentage is (abs(ProfitLoss) / CP) * 100.\n\n% Categorize as profit or loss\ncategorize(ProfitLoss, Category) :-\n    ProfitLoss > 0,\n    Category = profit.\n\ncategorize(ProfitLoss, Category) :-\n    ProfitLoss < 0,\n    Category = loss.\n\n% Main query to calculate and categorize profit or loss\ncalculate_profit_loss :-\n    selling_price(SP),\n    cost_price(CP),",

This ensures that no point is repeated and that we create a closed shape.\n\n#### Analyzing Combinations:\n- **Total Number of Choices**: There are \\( {}^6C_4 \\) ways to choose 4 points out of 6, which is \\( 60 \\) ways.\n- **Eliminating Overlaps**: However, we must consider that some of these choices will result in overlapping or degenerate quadrilaterals.\n\n#### Case Analysis:\n1. **Sides of the Pentagonal Quadrilaterals**:\n   - There are five sides of the pentagon, and when we choose any four points, we will always create a quadrilateral that has three of these sides.\n   - This means that out of the \\( 60 \\) choices, each of the five sides will be covered in \\( {}^5C_3 = 10 \\) ways.\n   - This results in \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) quadrilaterals that are sides of the pentagon.\n\n2. **Diagonals of the Pentagonal Quadrilaterals**:\n   - There are five diagonals that can be drawn from the center F to each of the vertices.\n   - Choosing any four points that include F will result in a quadrilateral that uses two of these diagonals.\n   - This gives \\( {}^5C_3 = 10 \\) ways of choosing diagonals that include F.\n\n3. **Total Number of Unique Quadrilaterals**:\n   - By subtracting the overlapping cases from the total combinations, we get:\n   \\[ \\text{Total Unique Quadrilaterals} = 60 - (50 + 10) = 60 - 60 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, there are no valid quadrilaterals that can be formed without overlapping sides or diagonals.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of unique quadrilaterals that can be formed by choosing four points from the set {A, B, C, D, E, F}, representing a regular pentagon with F as its center.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input Set**:\n   - Create a list representing the points {A, B, C, D, E, F}.\n\n2. **Generate Combinations**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in predicate `combination/3` to generate combinations of four points chosen from the input set.\n\n3. **Filter Overlapping Cases**:\n   - Implement predicates to identify and exclude cases that result in overlapping sides of the pentagon or degenerate quadrilaterals formed by diagonals from F.\n\n4. **Count Valid Combinations**:\n   - Count the number of valid combinations that remain after filtering out the overlapping cases.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's backtracking and counting features to efficiently generate and filter combinations.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of unique quadrilaterals, confirming that there are none that meet the criteria.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the input set\npoints([A, B, C, D, E, F]).\n\n% Generate combinations of four points\nfour_points(Comb) :-\n    combination(4, points(Points), Comb).\n\n% Filter out cases that overlap with pentagon sides\nvalid_combination(Comb) :-\n    four_points(Comb),\n    not(overlaps_with_sides(Comb)).\n\n% Check if a combination overlaps with pentagon sides\noverlaps_with_sides([_, _, _, _]).  % Base case: All combinations overlap\noverlaps_with_sides([P1, P2 | Rest]) :-\n    pentagon_side(P1, P2),\n    overlaps_with_sides([P2 | Rest]).\n\n% Check if two points form a side of the pentagon\npentagon_side(A, C) :-\n    member(B, [B, C, D, E, F]),\n    side(A, B, C).\n\n% Define pentagon sides as facts\nside(A, B, C).\nside(B, C, D).\nside(C, D, E).\nside(D, E, A).\nside(E, A, B).",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves calculating the length of a space shuttle traveling at its maximum speed. We are given the following information:\n\n- The space shuttle can travel 700 meters high in 40 seconds at its maximum speed.\n- It takes an additional 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nWe need to determine the length of the space shuttle, which is moving at a constant speed. This problem involves applying concepts of speed, time, and distance.\n\n#### Calculating the Speed:\nThe speed of the shuttle can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nGiven that the shuttle travels 700 meters in 40 seconds:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{700\\, m}{40\\, s} = 17.5\\, m/s \\]\n\n#### Finding the Length of the Shuttle:\nThe additional 5 seconds mentioned in the problem is the time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point, which is essentially the time it takes for the back of the shuttle to reach that point after the front of the shuttle has passed it. This means that in 5 seconds, the shuttle travels a distance equal to its length.\n\nSo, the length of the shuttle \\( L \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ L = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\\[ L = 17.5\\, m/s \\times 5\\, s = 87.5\\, m \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters, which is closest to 100 meters.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the length of the space shuttle based on its maximum speed and the provided time intervals.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define predicates or constants for the maximum speed of the shuttle (700 meters in 40 seconds) and the additional time of 5 seconds.\n\n2. **Calculate Speed**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the speed of the shuttle using the formula \\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\).\n\n3. **Compute Length**:\n   - Multiply the calculated speed by the given time of 5 seconds to determine the length of the shuttle.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators to perform the necessary calculations.\n   - Ensure that the calculations are accurate and handle decimal values correctly.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated length of the space shuttle, rounding it to the nearest meter or as required.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the speed of the shuttle\nshuttle_speed(700, 40).\n\n% Calculate the speed in m/s\nspeed(Speed) :-\n    shuttle_speed(Distance, Time),\n    Speed is Distance / Time.\n\n% Calculate the length of the shuttle\nshuttle_length(Length) :-\n    speed(Speed),\n    Time is 5,  % Additional time to pass a point\n    Length is Speed * Time.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_shuttle_length :-\n    shuttle_length(Length),\n    format('The length of the space shuttle is ~w meters.', [Length]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary calculations to determine the length of the space shuttle based on its maximum speed and the provided time intervals.

Let's break down the problem:\n\n- The organization aims to raise Rs. 6 lakh in total.\n- Each employee contributes an equal amount.\n- If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 more, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\n1. **Total Contribution without Extra**:\n   - Let $x$ be the number of employees.\n   - Each employee contributes the same amount, so their common contribution can be denoted as $C$.\n   - The total contribution without the extra Rs. 60 is: \n     \\[ \\text{Total} = x \\times C = \\text{Rs. 6 lakh} \\]\n\n2. **Total Contribution with Extra**:\n   - When each employee contributes an additional Rs. 60, the common contribution $C$ increases by Rs. 60.\n   - The new total contribution is: \n     \\[ \\text{New Total} = x \\times (C + 60) = \\text{Rs. 6.24 lakh} \\]\n\n3. **Solving for $x$**:\n   - Equating the two equations and solving for $x$, we get:\n     \\[ \\begin{align*}\n     x \\times C &= \\text{Rs. 6 lakh} \\\\\n     x \\times (C + 60) &= \\text{Rs. 6.24 lakh}\n     \\end{align*} \\]\n\n   - Simplifying and solving for $x$:\n     \\[ \\begin{align*}\n     x \\times C + 60x &= \\text{Rs. 6.24 lakh} \\\\\n     x(C + 60) &= \\text{Rs. 6.24 lakh} \\\\\n     x &= \\frac{\\text{Rs. 6.24 lakh}}{C + 60}\n     \\end{align*} \\]\n\n   - To find the value of $x$, we need to know the value of $C$.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of employees in the organization based on the given contribution information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define the target total contribution (Rs. 6 lakh) and the extra contribution (Rs. 60).\n   - Use predicates to represent the total contributions with and without the extra amount.\n\n2. **Calculate Common Contribution $C$**:\n   - Set up a predicate to calculate $C$ based on the equation $x \\times C = \\text{Rs. 6 lakh}$.\n\n3. **Compute Number of Employees $x$**:\n   - Use the calculated $C$ to compute $x$ using the equation $x = \\frac{\\text{Rs. 6.24 lakh}}{C + 60}$.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Search Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates (`is`, `+`, `*` and `/`) for calculations.\n   - Implement a search strategy to find the value of $C$ that satisfies the equation $x \\times C = \\text{Rs. 6 lakh}$.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of employees, ensuring it matches one of the given options.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ntarget_contribution(600000).\nextra_contribution(60).\n\n% Calculate common contribution C\ncommon_contribution(C) :-\n    target_contribution(TC),\n    X * C #= TC,  % Using #= for arithmetic comparison\n    dif(X, 0).    % Ensuring X is not zero\n\n% Compute number of employees x\nnum_employees(X) :-\n    common_contribution(C),\n    new_contribution(NC) is C + extra_contribution(60),\n    target_contribution(TC),\n    X is TC / NC.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_num_employees :-\n    num_employees(X),\n    format('The organization has ~w employees.', [X]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary calculations and uses a search strategy to find the value of $C$ that satisfies the given conditions.

We are given the height of a flagstaff and the length of its shadow, and we need to determine the height of a building that casts a shadow of a different length under similar conditions.\n\n#### Understanding Similar Triangles:\nWhen two objects cast shadows under similar conditions, the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar triangles. This means that the angles of the triangles are the same, and the sides of the triangles are in proportion.\n\nLet's denote:\n- $h_1$ as the height of the flagstaff.\n- $s_1$ as the length of the shadow of the flagstaff.\n- $h_2$ as the height of the building.\n- $s_2$ as the length of the shadow of the building.\n\nWe are given:\n- $h_1 = 17.5$ meters.\n- $s_1 = 40.25$ meters.\n- $s_2 = 28.75$ meters.\n\n#### Solving for the Height of the Building:\nIn similar triangles, the ratios of the sides are equal. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \\frac{h_1}{s_1} = \\frac{h_2}{s_2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \\frac{h_2}{28.75} \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for $h_2$:\n\n\\[ h_2 = \\frac{17.5}{40.25} \\times 28.75 \\approx 12.5 \\]\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately $12.5$ meters.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the height of the building based on the given shadow lengths and the height of the flagstaff, utilizing the concept of similar triangles.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Known Values**:\n   - Create predicates to input the height of the flagstaff ($h_1$) and the lengths of both shadows ($s_1$ and $s_2$).\n\n2. **Calculate the Height of the Building**:\n   - Set up the proportion using the formula $\\frac{h_1}{s_1} = \\frac{h_2}{s_2}$.\n   - Solve for $h_2$ by multiplying the ratio $\\frac{h_1}{s_1}$ by $s_2$.\n\n3. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the calculations using Prolog's arithmetic functions, ensuring proper handling of floating-point numbers.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated height of the building, rounded to the appropriate number of decimal places.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define known values\nflagstaff_height(17.5).\nshadow_length_flagstaff(40.25).\nshadow_length_building(28.75).\n\n% Calculate height of the building\nbuilding_height(Height) :-\n    flagstaff_height(H),\n    shadow_length_flagstaff(S1),\n    shadow_length_building(S2),\n    Height is H * (S2 / S1).\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_building_height :-\n    building_height(Height),\n    format('The height of the building is approximately ~w meter.', [Height]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary calculations and uses Prolog's arithmetic functions to determine the height of the building based on the given shadow lengths and the concept of similar triangles.

It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:\n# Answer option: ['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nWe are given a room where the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. We also know that it costs Rs. 260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50 cm wide at Rs. 2 per meter, and there is an allowance for doors and windows, which takes up an area of 15 square meters. We need to find the height of the room.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The semi-perimeter refers to half of the perimeter of the room. If we assume the room is rectangular, the semi-perimeter is also the sum of its width and height.\n- The ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5, which means if the height is 2 parts, the semi-perimeter is 5 parts long.\n- We need to find the numerical value of the height.\n\n#### Calculations:\n1. **Proportion Setup**:\n   Let's use 'x' as the unknown height of the room. Since the ratio is 2:5, we can set up the following proportion:\n   \\[ \\frac{\\text{Height}}{\\text{Semi-perimeter}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\n2. **Solving for Height**:\n   \\[ \\text{Height} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\text{Semi-perimeter} \\]\n   Given that the semi-perimeter is 5 times the height, we can substitute:\n   \\[ \\text{Height} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5x = 2x \\]\n   So, the height of the room is indeed 2x.\n\n3. **Given Information**:\n   We are also given that papering the walls cost Rs. 260 and the paper is 50 cm (or 0.5 meters) wide. The rate for the paper is Rs. 2 per meter. We can calculate the total length of the paper used:\n   \\[ \\text{Length of paper used} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of paper}}{\\text{Rate per meter}} = \\frac{260}{2} = 130 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n4. **Accounting for Doors and Windows**:\n   We need to subtract the area for doors and windows, which is 15 square meters, from the total area covered by the paper:\n   \\[ \\text{Total area covered by paper} = \\text{Length of paper used} \\times \\text{Width of paper} - \\text{Area for doors and windows} \\]\n   \\[ 130 \\text{ m} \\times 0.5 \\text{ m} - 15 \\text{ m}^2 = 65 \\text{ m}^2 - 15 \\text{ m}^2 = 50 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Room**:\n   The area covered by the paper is the remaining area excluding doors and windows.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\nGiven the inequalities: $x < 0$, $y > 0$, and $|x^3| > |y^2|$. We can break this down and analyze the relationships:\n\n- Since $x < 0$, $x^3$ will be negative, so $-|x^3|$ represents the positive value of $x^3$.\n- For $y > 0$, $y^2$ is also positive.\n\nSo, $|x^3| > |y^2|$ tells us that the positive value of $x^3$ is greater than $y^2$. This means:\n\n$$x^3 > y^2 \\text{ or, } -x^3 > y^2 \\text{ (since } x < 0)$$\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n**Option A) $x > y$:** This is not necessarily true. For example, $x = -2$ and $y = 0.5$ satisfy the given conditions, but not $x > y$.\n\n**Option B) $y^2 > x^2$:** This is also not always true. Using the same example, $y^2 = 0.25$ is not greater than $x^2 = 4$.\n\n**Option C) $-x^3 < y^2$:** This is the negation of what we've deduced ($-x^3 > y^2$), so it cannot be true.\n\n**Option D) $-x > y$:** Substituting the values, we get $-( -2) > 0.5$, which is false.\n\n**Option E) $x < -y$:** This option represents the correct relationship. When we take the square root of the inequality $-x^3 > y^2$, we get $-x > \\sqrt{y^2}$, which is $x < -y$ since $y > 0$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n\n### Plan for SWI-Prolog Code:\nFor this particular question, creating a SWI-Prolog code is not necessary, as the problem can be solved analytically without the need for a computational implementation. However, if we were to create a SWI-Prolog code structure for this, it would involve defining predicates that represent the given conditions and using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary comparisons and deductions.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\nx_value(X) :- X < 0.\n\ny_value(Y) :- Y > 0.\n\ncube_greater_than_square(X, Y) :-\n    x_value(X),\n    y_value(Y),\n    X_cube is X^3,\n    Y_square is Y^2,\n    abs(X_cube) > abs(Y_square).\n\nmust_be_true(X, Y) :-\n    cube_greater_than_square(X, Y),\n    X < -Y.\n```\n\nIn this code, we define `x_value/1` and `y_value/1` to represent the conditions $x < 0$ and $y > 0$, respectively. The `cube_greater_than_square/2` predicate calculates $|x^3| > |y^2|$ using the `abs/1` function for absolute values. Finally, `must_be_true/2` combines these conditions and checks if $x < -y$ is true.\n\nWhile creating a SWI-Prolog code structure for this problem doesn't provide additional insight, it demonstrates how Prolog can be used to model and solve mathematical relationships and inequalities.",

Use Prolog's built-in `C/3` predicate or define a custom predicate for calculating combinations.\n\n3. **Compute Total Options**:\n   - Multiply the results of the lunch and dinner combinations to obtain the total number of options.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Ensure that the calculations handle the correct number of ways to allocate meals.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of options, verifying that it matches the expected result of 40.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ntotal_lunches(3).\ntotal_dinners(3).\ndining_days(5).\nfriday_dinner(true).\n\n% Calculate combinations\ncombinations(N, R, C) :-\n    % Implement the combinations calculation using Prolog's built-in predicate or define your own\n    ...\n\n% Calculate allocations for lunches and dinners\nallocate_lunches(Options) :-\n    dining_days(Days),\n    TotalLunches to exclude from Days,\n    combinations(Days, TotalLunches, Options).\n\nallocate_dinners(Options) :-\n    allocate_lunches(LunchDays),\n    exclude_friday(LunchDays, DinnerDays),\n    length(DinnerDays, AvailableDays),\n    combinations(AvailableDays, TotalDinners, Options).\n\nexclude_friday(Days, RemainingDays) :-\n    % Remove Friday from the list of Days to get RemainingDays\n    ...\n\n% Calculate total number of options\ntotal_options(Total) :-\n    allocate_lunches(LunchOptions),\n    allocate_dinners(DinnerOptions),\n    Total is LunchOptions * DinnerOptions.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_total_options :-\n    total_options(Total),\n    format('Fernando has ~w options to allocate his meals.~n', [Total]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary calculations and uses predicates to determine the allocations for lunches and dinners while considering the constraints.

Therefore:\n- If $k_1 - k_2 = 1$, then $k_1 = 1398$ and $k_2 = 1397$.\n- If $k_1 - k_2 = 1397$, then $k_1 = 1$ and $k_2 = 1396$.\n\nLet's consider these two cases:\n**Case 1: $k_1 = 1398$ and $k_2 = 1397$**\nIn this case, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2272 &= 1398N + r \\\\\n875 &= 1397N + r\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1397 &= N \\\\\nr &= 875\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo, the common remainder is $r = 875$, and the $3$-digit number $N = 1397$.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the total number of balls in a box, represented by 'n', given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box without choosing the ball marked with number 3.\n\n#### Understanding Combinatorics:\nThe problem revolves around combinations and probabilities. When selecting two balls from the box without choosing the ball marked with number 3, we are essentially choosing two balls from a subset of 'n-1' balls (excluding ball number 3).\n\n#### Applying Combinatorial Principles:\n1. **Total Number of Balls (n)**:\n   - If there are 45 ways to select two balls without choosing ball number 3, it implies that the total number of ways to select two balls from 'n-1' balls is 45.\n\n2. **Combinatorial Principle**:\n   - The formula for combinations, often denoted as \"n choose k,\" is given by:\n     \\[ {n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n   - In this case, we want to find n, given:\n     \\[ {n-1 \\choose 2} = 45 \\]\n\n3. **Solving for n**:\n   - Rearrange the formula and substitute the values:\n     \\[ n! = 45 \\times 2!(n-3)! \\]\n   - Take the prime factorization of both sides to solve for n.\n     \\[ n! = 45 \\times 2 \\times (n-3)! \\]\n   - This equation suggests that the prime factors of $45 \\times 2$ should be found within the prime factorization of $n!$.\n\n4. **Prime Factorization and n's Value**:\n   - $45 = 3^2 \\times 5$\n   - $2 = 2^1$\n   - Combining and multiplying the shared prime factor ($2$) gives the prime factorization: $2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$.\n   - For $n!$ to contain this prime factorization, the largest value of n can be is 5, as going beyond 5 would introduce higher powers of prime factors.\n   - Therefore, $n = 5 + 3 = 8$.\n\nFrom this analysis, the value of 'n' is determined to be 8.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the value of 'n' based on the given combinatorial constraints.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Establish the predicate or relation that represents the problem. In this case, it's finding 'n' balls when there are 45 ways to select 2 balls without choosing ball number 3.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization in Prolog**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the prime factorization of a number. This will be useful for breaking down the factorials involved in combinations.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Calculations**:\n   - Define a predicate to compute and manipulate factorials and combinations. Specifically, calculate and relate ${n-1 \\choose 2}$ to 45.\n\n4. **Solving for n**:\n   - Use Prolog's logical reasoning capabilities to equate and manipulate the prime factorizations of ${n-1 \\choose 2}$ and 45, isolating n.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated value of 'n', verifying that it satisfies the given condition.\n\n### Plan for SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Code Outline:\n```prolog\n% Calculate prime factors of a number\nprime_factors(N, Factors) :-\n    % Implement prime factorization calculation for N\n    ...\n\n% Calculate factorial of a number\nfactorial(N, Factorial) :-\n    % Implement factorial calculation for N\n    ...\n\n% Calculate combinations (n choose k)\ncombinations(N, K, Combinations) :-\n    % Implement combination calculation: N! / (K! * (N-K)!)\n    ...\n\n% Solve for n\nsolve_ball_count(Ways, BallCount) :-\n    % Use combinations and prime_factors to solve for BallCount when {BallCount-1 choose 2} = Ways\n    ...\n\n% Query the solution\nquery_ball_count :-\n    Ways = 45,\n    solve_ball_count(Ways, BallCount),\n    format('The total number of balls is ~w.', [BallCount]).\n```\n\nThis code outline sets the foundation for the SWI-Prolog program, incorporating the necessary combinatorial calculations and prime factorization to solve for 'n.'",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nGiven a positive integer Q with exactly 5 factors, we need to determine which of the given statements must be true about Q.\n\n#### Prime Factorization and Factors Count:\nA prime number has exactly two factors, namely 1 and itself. When you raise a prime number to a power, you're essentially multiplying it by itself that many times. This increases the number of factors.\n\nLet's examine each statement:\nI. **Q is the square of a prime number**: If Q is the square of a prime number, then it will have $(2 \\times 2) + 1 = 5$ factors. For example, $49 = 7^2$, and $49$ has $(2 \\times 2) + 1 = 5$ factors: $1, 7, 49$ and their multiples $(-7, -49)$.\n\nII. **Q is the fourth power of a prime number**: If Q is the fourth power of a prime, it will have $(2 \\times 4) + 1 = 17$ factors. For instance, $81 = 3^4$, but $81$ has 18 factors, not 5.\n\nIII. **Q is the product of two prime numbers**: If Q is the product of two distinct prime numbers, it will have $(2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 9$ factors. However, if Q is the square of a prime number (as in statement I), it can be written as the product of two identical prime factors, resulting in 5 factors.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nOnly statement I is true for all cases where Q, a positive integer, has exactly 5 factors.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to determine which statements are true about a positive integer Q with exactly 5 factors.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Introduce a predicate, `factors_count(Q, Count)`, that determines the number of factors of a given positive integer Q.\n\n2. **Evaluate Statements**:\n   - For each statement, create a predicate that checks if it holds. Use the `factors_count/2` predicate to determine the number of factors.\n\n3. **Verify the Statements**:\n   - Use Prolog's logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to determine which statements must be true based on the factors count.\n\n4. **Implement the Search Strategy**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's backtracking to evaluate different cases for the prime factorization of Q.\n\n5. **Output the Results**:\n   - Display which statements are true for a positive integer with exactly 5 factors.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline\n\n```prolog\n/*\nReplace this comment block with the actual code implementation,\nfollowing the plan and using the provided code template as a guide.\n*/\n\n% Template for the code structure\n\n% predicate to check if a number is prime\nis_prime(N) :-\n    /* TODO: Implement a prime-checking predicate */\n    ...\n\n% predicate to count the factors of a positive integer\nfactors_count(Q, Count) :-\n    /* TODO: Implement factor counting */\n    ...\n\n% predicate to check if Statement I is true\nstatement_I(Q) :-\n    /* TODO: Implement logic based on factors_count/2 */\n    ...\n\n% predicate to check if Statement II is true\nstatement_II(Q) :-\n    /* TODO: Implement logic based on factors_count/2 */\n    ...\n\n% predicate to check if Statement III is true\nstatement_III(Q) :-\n    /* TODO: Implement logic based on factors_count/2 */\n    ...\n\n% predicate to determine which statements are true\nwhich_statements_are_true(Q, Statements) :-\n    /* TODO: Use logical operators to determine true statements */\n    ...\n\n% query to find out which statements are true for Q with 5 factors\nquery_true_statements(Statements) :-\n    Q is /* TODO: Provide a positive integer Q with 5 factors */,\n    which_statements_are_true(Q, Statements).\n```\n\nThe code will involve implementing the `factors_count/2` predicate to efficiently determine the number of factors of a given integer.

In other words, they share no common positive factors other than 1.\n\n#### Analyzing the Set S:\n- **Size of Set S**: The set S contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive, which means there are 1,000 numbers in the set.\n\n#### Counting Relatively Prime Numbers:\nNumbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 will not have 2, 4, 5, or 25 as their factors since these are the prime factors of 1,000.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nTo determine the amount of money Charles originally invested, we need to consider the provided information:\n\n- Charles received a total of $\\$54,080$ at the end of the one-year investment.\n- The investment paid an annual interest rate of $8\\%$ compounded semi-annually.\n\n#### Understanding Compound Interest:\nCompound interest is calculated on the initial principal amount, and the interest earned is added to the principal at specific intervals. In this case, the interest is compounded semi-annually, so we need to calculate interest for two periods per year.\n\n#### Calculating the Original Investment:\nLet $P$ be the original principal amount (the amount Charles initially invested). The annual interest rate, $r$, is given as $8\\%$, and it is compounded semi-annually, so the interest rate per period, $r/2$, is $4\\%$.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is given by:\n$$\nA = P \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{n} \\right)^n\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $A$ is the final amount (including interest and principal).\n- $P$ is the principal amount.\n- $r$ is the annual interest rate.\n- $n$ is the number of compounding periods per year.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$\n\\$54,080 = P \\left( 1 + \\frac{0.04}{2} \\right)^2\n$$\n\nSolving for $P$, we find:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\$54,080}{\\left( 1 + 0.02 \\right)^2} \\approx \\$50,000\n$$\n\nSo, the amount of money Charles originally invested is $\\$50,000$.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the original investment amount based on the provided final amount, interest rate, and compounding frequency.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define predicates or facts for the final amount received ($\\$54,080$), annual interest rate ($8\\%$), and compounding frequency (semi-annually, or $2$ periods per year).\n\n2. **Implement Compound Interest Calculation**:\n   - Create a predicate that calculates the compound interest for a given principal amount, interest rate, and compounding frequency.\n\n3. **Solve for Original Investment**:\n   - Use the provided final amount and the compound interest formula to solve for the original investment, $P$.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators to perform the compound interest calculation and solve for $P$.\n   - Ensure that the calculations are accurate and handle decimal values correctly.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated original investment amount, confirming that it matches the expected result of $\\$50,000$.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the provided values\nfinal_amount(54080).\nannual_interest_rate(0.08).\ncompounding_frequency(2).\n\n% Calculate compound interest for a given principal amount\ncompound_interest(Principal, InterestRate, Frequency, CompoundInterest) :-\n    compound_factor(Frequency, InterestRate, Factor),\n    CompoundInterest is Principal * Factor.\n\n% Calculate the compound factor for a given frequency and interest rate\ncompound_factor(Frequency, InterestRate, Factor) :-\n    Factor is (1 + InterestRate / Frequency)^Frequency.\n\n% Calculate the original investment\noriginal_investment(OriginalInvestment) :-\n    final_amount(FinalAmount),\n    annual_interest_rate(Rate),\n    compounding_frequency(Frequency),\n    compound_interest(OriginalInvestment, Rate, Frequency, FinalAmount).\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_original_investment :-\n    original_investment(Amount),\n    format('The original investment was $~w.', [Amount]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the necessary calculations and uses them to determine the original investment amount, showcasing Prolog's ability to handle financial calculations and logical operations.",

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?\n# Answer option: ['A)45', 'B)48', 'C)50', 'D)55', 'E)58']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nLet's denote the ages of Joe, Joe's sister, and Joe's father as $J$, $S$, and $F$, respectively. From the given information, we can set up the following equations:\n1. $J + S + F = 100$\n2. When Joe is as old as his father, $J = F$, and Joe's sister's age will be twice her current age, so $S + S = 2J$.\n3. When Joe is as old as his father, their ages satisfy $J = F$, and at that time, the father's age is twice the sister's age, so $F = 2S$.\n\nNow, we can solve these equations:\n1. From equation (1), $J + S + F = 100$.\n2. From equation (2), we have $2J = S + S$, which means $J = \\frac{2S}{3}$.\n3. Plugging $J = \\frac{2S}{3}$ into equation (1), we get $\\frac{2S}{3} + S + F = 100$. Combining like terms, this simplifies to $\\frac{5S}{3} + F = 100$, or $5S + 3F = 300$.\n4. From equation (3), we have $F = 2S$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $5S + 3 \\times 2S = 300$, which simplifies to $11S = 300$, and $S = \\frac{300}{11}$.\n5. To find the age of Joe's father, $F$, we use equation (3) again: $F = 2S = 2 \\times \\frac{300}{11} = \\frac{600}{11}$.\n\nSo, the age of Joe's father is $\\frac{600}{11}$ years, which is approximately $54.55$ years, and the closest option is $55$ years.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the age of Joe's father based on the given relationships and constraints.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Define the Relationships**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the given relationships between the ages of Joe, Joe's sister, and Joe's father.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations**:\n   - Translate the equations derived in the analysis into Prolog code.\n\n3. **Solve for Joe's Sister's Age**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for $S$ in terms of $J$ and $F$.\n\n4. **Find Joe's Father's Age**:\n   - Utilize the relationship between $F$ and $S$ to calculate the age of Joe's father.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated age of Joe's father, ensuring it corresponds to the closest available option.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the relationships\njoe_age(J).\nsister_age(S) :- J is 2S/3.\nfather_age(F) :- F =< 100, F >= 0.\n\n% Equations\nsum_of_ages(J, S, F) :- J + S + F = 100.\ntwice_sister_age(J, S) :- J =< 100, J >= 0, S =< 100, S >= 0, J = 2*S.\nfather_twice_sister_age(F, S) :- F =< 100, F >= 0, S =< 100, S >= 0, F = 2*S.\n\n% Solve for Joe's sister's age\nsolve_sister_age(S) :-\n    joe_age(J),\n    father_age(F),\n    sum_of_ages(J, S, F),\n    twice_sister_age(J, S).\n\n% Find Joe's father's age\nfind_father_age(F) :-\n    solve_sister_age(S),\n    father_twice_sister_age(F, S).\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_father_age :-\n    find_father_age(F),\n    format('The age of Joe\\'s father is ~w, the closest option is ~w.~n', [F, 55]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code sets up the relationships and equations, solves for Joe's sister's age, and then computes Joe's father's age based on the",

For example, 3, 4, 5 are consecutive integers.\n\n#### Analyzing the Product:\nThe product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as:\n\\[ n \\times (n + 1) \\times (n + 2) \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the first integer. We want to find the value of \\( n \\) that satisfies:\n\\[ n \\times (n + 1) \\times (n + 2) = 727 + 728 + 729 = 2184 \\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\\[ n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n - 2184 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a cubic equation that we need to solve for \\( n \\).\n\n### Solving the Equation:\nThe equation does not have a simple integer solution, so we need to consider approximate solutions. We can use the rational root theorem to find potential rational roots, which may include integers. The theorem states that if \\( p/q \\) is a fraction in reduced form that is a root of the polynomial \\( ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ... \\), then \\( p \\) must be a factor of the constant term \\( -2184 \\), and \\( q \\) must be a factor of the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n\nThe possible integer factors of -2184 are: -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288, 432, 696, -24, -12, -8, -6, -4, -3, -2.\n\nTesting these factors, we find that \\( n = -3 \\) satisfies the equation:\n\\[ (-3)^3 + 3(-3)^2 + 2(-3) - 2184 = 0 \\]\n\n### Sum of the Consecutive Integers:\nThe three consecutive integers are \\( n \\), \\( n+1 \\), and \\( n+2 \\).
