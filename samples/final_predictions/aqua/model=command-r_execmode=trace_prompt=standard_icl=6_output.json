Additionally, we need to determine how many of the letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Analyzing the Bike Number Format:\n- **Format**: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n- **Letters**: Assuming the use of the English alphabet, there are 26 possible letters.\n- **Numbers**: Each number can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values per number position.\n\n#### Calculation of Total Combinations:\n1. **Letter Combinations**: \n   - If both letters need to be distinct, the number of combinations for the first letter is 26, and for the second letter, it is 25 (since it cannot be the same as the first).\n   - Total distinct letter combinations = \\( 26 \\times 25 \\).\n\n2. **Number Combinations**:\n   - Each of the two number positions can be any of 10 digits (0-9).\n   - Total number combinations = \\( 10 \\times 10 \\).\n\n3. **Total Bike Numbers**:\n   - Total combinations = (Total distinct letter combinations) \u00d7 (Total number combinations).\n   - Total combinations = \\( (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 10) = 65000 \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 65,000, assuming both letters need to be distinct.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using the specified format and checks how many letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of letters (26) and the range of numbers (0-9).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations for Letters**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 distinct letters from the 26 available.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Numbers**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 numbers where each number can be from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two predicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the generation of combinations and ensure distinctness where required.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n   - Confirm the requirement for the letters to be distinct by checking the calculated total against the expected result (65000).\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and confirm the conditions regarding the distinctness of letters. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in handling combinatorial logic and arithmetic operations."

For the word \"PROBLEC\":\n   \\[ 7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040 \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the number of distinct 7-letter words that can be formed from \"PROBLEC\" is 5040, corresponding to \\( 7! \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of permutations for the given set of letters in \"PROBLEC\".\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create a list representing the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\".\n\n2. **Permutation Calculation**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in permutation predicate or define a custom one to generate all possible permutations of the list of letters.\n\n3. **Counting Permutations**:\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s aggregation predicates to count the number of unique permutations generated from the original list. This step involves listing all permutations and then counting them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Implement efficient search through the space of all permutations of the provided letters.\n   - Use the `findall` predicate to gather all permutations and the `length` predicate to count them, ensuring we get the factorial number as calculated analytically.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of permutations, verifying that it matches \\( 7! = 5040 \\).\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling lists and permutations efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem.

This means the maximum number of students who didn't attend is \\( 100\\% - 45\\% = 55\\% \\) or 0.55 of the total students.\n\n2. **Debating Session Participation**:\n   - A minimum of 35% of students participated in the debating session. This implies that a maximum of \\( 100\\% - 35\\% = 65\\% \\) of students didn't participate.\n\n3. **Intersecting Groups**:\n   - Some students may have attended both events, so we need to account for this overlap.\n   - The maximum number of students in the intersection of these two groups is the lower of the two percentages: 45%.\n\n#### Determining the Maximum Non-Attendance Group:\n- To find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either event, we subtract the overlapping group from the smaller of the two non-attendance groups.\n- The maximum number of students is \\( 0.55 \\times 200 - 0.45 \\times 200 = 10 \\) students.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to compute the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom night nor the debating session.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set the total number of students as a constant.\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Non-Attendance Groups**:\n   - Compute the maximum number of students who didn't attend the prom night and those who didn't participate in the debating session, as a percentage of the total students.\n\n3. **Account for Overlap**:\n   - Calculate the overlapping group size using the smaller of the two percentages.\n\n4. **Find Maximum Non-Attendees**:\n   - Subtract the size of the overlapping group from the smaller non-attendance group to get the maximum number of students who didn't attend either event.\n\n5. **Convert to Total Number**:\n   - Multiply the result by the total number of students to get the actual count of students.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of students\ntotal_students(200).\n\n% Calculate maximum non-attendees for prom night and debating session\nmax_non_prom_attendees(NonAttendees) :-\n    total_students(Total),\n    NonAttendees is 0.55 * Total.\n\nmax_non_debating_attendees(NonAttendees) :-\n    total_students(Total),\n    NonAttendees is 0.65 * Total.\n\n% Find the size of the overlapping group\noverlapping_group_size(Size) :-\n    max_non_prom_attendees(PromNonAttendees),\n    max_non_debating_attendees(DebatingNonAttendees),\n    Size is min(PromNonAttendees, DebatingNonAttendees).\n\n% Compute the maximum number of students who didn't attend either event\nmax_neither_event(Count) :-\n    max_non_prom_attendees(PromNonAttendees),\n    overlapping_group_size(OverlapSize),\n    Count is PromNonAttendees - OverlapSize.\n\n% Display the result\nquery_max_neither_event :-\n    max_neither_event(Count),\n    format('~w students did not attend either event.', [Count]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code follows a step-by-step approach to analyze and determine the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom night or the debating session.

        "question": "A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?\n# Answer option: ['A)12', 'B)16', 'C)24', 'D)30', 'E)40']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of bags of flour sold by a grocer who makes a 25% profit on each bag's selling price. We can approach this problem by understanding the relationship between the selling price and the profit.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The grocer makes a 25% profit on each bag's selling price.\n- The total profit earned is $3,000.\n\n#### Calculating the Selling Price and Quantity:\n1. **Profit Calculation**:\n   - The 25% profit means that the actual cost of the bag is 75% of the selling price.\n   - Therefore, the profit of $3,000 can be expressed as:\n   \\[ 0.75 \\times \\text{Selling Price} = \\$3,000 \\]\n\n2. **Selling Price Determination**:\n   - Solving for the selling price, we find:\n   \\[ \\text{Selling Price} = \\$4,000 \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Bags**:\n   - Since each bag is sold for $4,000, the number of bags sold can be found by dividing the total earnings by the selling price of one bag:\n   \\[ \\text{Number of Bags} = \\frac{\\$3,000}{\\$4,000} = 0.75 \\text{ bags} \\]\n   Rounding down since bags are whole quantities, the grocer sold **0.75 bags**.\n\nWhile this analysis provides an insight into the possible solution, it highlights a crucial detail: the selling price should not be a decimal value; it should be a whole number since prices are typically denominated in whole units. This apparent discrepancy suggests that we may have overlooked some details in the problem statement or that the problem itself might be ambiguous.\n\nTo proceed with a more definitive solution, let's assume that each bag of flour has a fixed selling price, and the 25% profit is calculated based on that price.\n\n#### Alternative Approach:\n1. **Profit Calculation**:\n   - Let the original price of the bag be \\( P \\).\n   - The selling price is \\( 1.25 \\times P \\), as the grocer makes a 25% profit.\n\n2. **Solving for the Original Price**:\n   - With a total profit of $3,000, the original price can be found as follows:\n   \\[ 1.25 \\times P = \\$100 \\text{ (selling price)} \\\\\n   P = \\$80 \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Bags**:\n   - Now, the number of bags sold is simply the total earnings divided by the original price:\n   \\[ \\text{Number of Bags} = \\frac{\\$3,000}{\\$80} = 37.5 \\text{ bags} \\]\n   Rounding down to the nearest whole number, the grocer sold **37 bags**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of bags of flour sold based on the given profit and selling price details.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Relationship**:\n   - Create a predicate that establishes the relationship between the original price (`price`), the selling price (`selling_price`), and the profit percentage (`profit_percent`).\n\n2. **Calculate the Original Price**:\n   - Given the selling price of $100 and a 25% profit, calculate the original price using the relationship defined in step 1.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Bags**:\n   - Divide the total profit by the original price to determine the number of bags sold.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and predicates to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of bags sold.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the relationship between prices\nbag_pricing(Price, SellingPrice) :-\n    SellingPrice is 1.25 * Price.\n\n% Predicate to calculate the number of bags sold\nbags_sold(TotalProfit, NumberOfBags) :-\n    bag_pricing(price, 100),  % Assuming a selling price of $100\n    TotalProfit is 3000,     % Total profit earned\n    NumberOfBags is floor(TotalProfit / price).\n\n% Query to find the number of bags\nquery_bags_sold :-\n    bags_sold(_, Bags),\n    write(Bags).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code addresses the problem by considering the given relationship between selling price and profit while ensuring that prices are handled appropriately.

        "question": "When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.\n# Answer option: ['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves finding the area of a rectangular sheet that, when folded into two equal halves, has specific perimeter values for different folding scenarios.\n\n#### Understanding the Scenario:\nWhen folded along one set of sides, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the other set, the perimeter changes to 66 cm. We need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\n#### Calculating the Side Lengths:\n1. **Common Side Length**:\n   - Since the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the common side length \\( l \\) is half the length of one side.\n\n2. **Perimeter of One Half**:\n   - With a perimeter of 48 cm for one half when folded along one set of sides, we can express this as: \\( 2 \\times \\text{length of one side} + 2 \\times l = 48 \\text{ cm} \\)\n   - Solving for the length of one side, we get: \\( \\text{Length of one side} = 24 \\text{ cm} \\)\n\n3. **Length of Sides After Folding Along Other Set**:\n   - When folded along the other set of sides, the length of the sides parallel to the fold remains the same \\( l \\), but the sides perpendicular to the fold double in length.\n   - Thus, after this folding, the perimeter becomes: \\( 2 \\times 2l + 2 \\times (\\text{doubled length}) = 66 \\text{ cm} \\)\n   - The doubled length is \\( 2 \\times l \\), so we have: \\( 2l + 4l = 66 \\text{ cm} \\)\n   - Hence, \\( l = 11 \\text{ cm} \\)\n\n#### Calculating the Area:\n- The area of the sheet is the product of its length and breadth. With the length being 24 cm and the breadth being twice that (as it's doubled when folded), the breadth is 48 cm.\n- Area = \\( 24 \\text{ cm} \\times 48 \\text{ cm} = \\boxed{1152} \\text{ cm}^2 \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the area of the rectangular sheet based on the given perimeter values after folding.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Perimeter Constants**:\n   - Set facts for the perimeters of each half after folding along the two sets of sides, namely `perimeter_along_sides_1` and `perimeter_along_sides_2`.\n\n2. **Calculate Side Lengths**:\n   - Write predicates to compute the length of one side and the common side length (`l`) using half the value of the given perimeters.\n\n3. **Determine Breadth**:\n   - Calculate the breadth by doubling the common side length.\n\n4. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - Multiply the length and breadth to obtain the area of the sheet.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated area, ensuring it matches the expected value of 1152 cm^2.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the perimeters for each half\nperimeter_along_sides_1(48).\nperimeter_along_sides_2(66).\n\n% Calculate side lengths\nlength_of_side(24).\ncommon_side_length(11).\n\n% Calculate the breadth\nbreadth(48).\n\n% Compute the area\narea(1152).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code clearly breaks down the problem, allowing each step of the calculation to be handled separately.

Since it has dimensions of 3x4x15, the center is found at (1.5, 2, 7.5), where the coordinates represent the distances from each respective face's center.\n\n#### Determining the Sphere's Diameter:\nWith the center of the rectangle known, the diameter of the sphere can be determined. The diameter passes through the center, so it will have a length of twice the distance from the center to any point on the sphere's surface.\n\nThe rectangular solid's side lengths represent twice the distance from the center to one of its corners, i.e., one side of the rectangle or square faces.

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?\n# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)15', 'C)12', 'D)6', 'E)3']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the time it would take for hose B to fill the entire pool by itself, given that hose A can fill it in 8 hours and both hoses together finish the job in 3 more hours after hose A worked alone for 2 hours.\n\n#### Understanding the Scenario:\n- Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours.\n- After 2 hours of working alone, hose A has partially filled the pool. The remaining work is completed by both hoses in 3 hours.\n\n#### Calculating Hose B's Work:\n1. **Hose A's Work in 2 Hours**:\n   - In the first 2 hours, hose A fills a fraction of the pool. Let's denote this fraction as \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) of the total pool volume, where \\( n \\) is the number of hours it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.\n\n2. **Remaining Work**:\n   - After 2 hours, the remaining work is \\( \\frac{n-2}{n} \\) of the pool's volume, as hose A has filled \\( \\frac{2}{n} \\) in that time.\n\n3. **Work Done by Both Hoses in 3 Hours**:\n   - Together, both hoses can fill \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) of the pool in 1 hour. Therefore, in 3 hours, they fill \\( \\frac{3}{n} \\) of the remaining volume.\n\n4. **Calculating Hose B's Solo Time**:\n   - To find the time it would take hose B to fill the entire pool alone, we set \\( \\frac{3}{n} \\) of the remaining volume equal to \\( \\frac{n-2}{n} \\) (work done in 3 hours by both hoses). This results in:\n   \\[ \\frac{3}{n} = \\frac{n-2}{n} \\]\n   \\[ n = 6 \\]\n   Therefore, it would take hose B alone \\( 6 \\) hours to fill the entire pool.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time it would take for hose B to fill the pool by itself based on the provided scenario.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define the time it takes hose A to fill the pool (8 hours) and the time it takes both hoses to finish the job (3 hours after 2 hours of hose A's work).\n\n2. **Calculate Hose A's Partial Fill Time**:\n   - Determine the fraction of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours. Use a variable `HoseBTime` for the time it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Work**:\n   - Compute the remaining work as a fraction of the total pool volume, after hose A's partial fill.\n\n4. **Determine Work Done by Both Hoses**:\n   - Calculate the work done by both hoses in the additional 3 hours, again using `HoseBTime` as the unknown.\n\n5. **Solve for HoseBTime**:\n   - Set the work done by both hoses in 3 hours equal to the remaining work after hose A's initial efforts.

Let's denote the total number of students as \\( N \\).\n\n2. \\( 24\\% \\) of students are in both groups, so the number of students in this overlap is \\( 0.24 \\times N \\).\n\n3. If 20% of the swim team members are *not* in the chess club, then \\( 80\\% \\) of the swim team members *are* in the chess club. The number of students in this group is \\( 0.8 \\times \\text{Number of Swim Team Members} \\).\n\n4.

Calculate the increase in population for Year 1:\n   \\[ \\text{Increase in Pop., Year 1} = 0.05 \\times 78000 = 3900 \\]\n\n2. Add this increase to the current population to find the population at the end of Year 1:\n   \\[ \\text{Population, Year 1} = 78000 + 3900 = 81900 \\]\n\n#### Plan for Year 2:\n3.

Additionally, the small cubes at the very center of the hollow cube will also have their faces unpainted.\n\n3. **Counting Unpainted Faces**:\n   - The inner layer has similar cubes in every direction like the outer layer, but none of their faces are painted.\n   - The center cubes have 2 faces unpainted (the ones facing the cube's center).\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Unpainted Faces:\n- The hollow cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces.\n- Each vertex is shared by 8 small cubes, and each face is made up of 4 small cubes.\n- There are 2 layers of small cubes around the perimeter.\n\nThe number of unpainted faces is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ vertices} \\times 8 \\text{ small cubes per vertex} + 6 \\text{ faces} \\times 4 \\text{ small cubes per face} \\times 2 \\text{ layers} + 6 \\text{ center faces} \\times 2 \\text{ unpainted faces per center cube} \\]\n\\[ = 64 + 96 + 12 = 172 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes is 172.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Hollow Cube's Parameters**:\n   - Define constants for the size of the hollow cube and the smaller cubes.\n\n2. **Identify Painted and Unpainted Cubes**:\n   - Determine which small cubes belong to the outer layer, inner layer, and the center cubes.\n\n3. **Count Unpainted Faces**:\n   - For the outer layer, count the faces based on the number of small cubes per vertex and per face.\n   - For the inner layer, do the same, knowing that all faces are unpainted.\n   - Account for the unpainted faces of the center cubes.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Unpainted Faces**:\n   - Sum up the counts from different regions of the hollow cube.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's reasoning and counting capabilities to distinguish between painted and unpainted cubes and calculate their respective face counts.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of unpainted faces, ensuring it matches the expected result of 172.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants for cube sizes\nhollow_cube_size(5).\nsmaller_cube_size(1).\n\n% Predicate to calculate unpainted faces\nunpainted_faces :-\n    hollow_cube_size(HCSize),\n    smaller_cube_size(SCSize),\n    % Calculate based on cube structure\n    OuterLayerCount is 64 + (96 * 2), % 2 layers\n    CenterFacesCount is 6 * 2, % 2 unpainted faces per center cube\n    TotalUnpainted is OuterLayerCount + CenterFacesCount,\n    format('~w', [TotalUnpainted]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code logically breaks down the problem, considering the different regions of the hollow cube and their impact on the number of unpainted faces.

To find the number of days it will take for the frog to reach the top, we need to analyze its progress each day.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The well has a depth of 30 meters.\n- The frog jumps 3 meters up each day, but falls back 2 meters at the end of the same day.\n\n#### Strategy for Escape:\nThe frog needs to ascend by a total of 30 meters to escape the well. We can determine the number of days required by starting from the bottom and incrementally adding the net gain in elevation each day.\n\n#### Net Gain per Day:\nEach day, the frog gains \\( 3\\text{m} - 2\\text{m} = 1\\text{m} \\) towards reaching the top.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Days:\nTo determine the number of days \\( d \\), we set up the equation:\n\\[ 1\\text{m} \\times d = 30\\text{m} \\]\nSolving for \\( d \\), we find:\n\\[ d = 30\\text{ days} \\]\nHowever, since the frog loses some progress each day, we need to account for that. Therefore, we can conclude that it will take more than 30 days.\n\n#### Refining the Calculation:\nThe actual number of days can be found by starting from day 30 and decrementing the elevation by 2 meters each day until the frog reaches the top.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that simulates the frog's journey up the well and calculates the number of days it takes for him to reach the top.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set the initial depth of the well to 30 meters.\n\n2. **Frog's Daily Journey**:\n   - Write a predicate that simulates the frog's progress each day.

We can approach this problem by first understanding the pattern of numbers that meet this criterion.\n\nWhen dividing the sum of five consecutive odd numbers by 10, we observe that the last digit of this quotient will always be 5, as the last digit of each odd number is 1 and there are five such numbers.

The task is to find the difference between R's age and Q's age.\n\n#### Understanding the Relationship:\nThe statement \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\" implies that the difference in age between Q and R is the same as the difference in age between Q and T.

We need to find the perimeter of this rectangle.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The area of the rectangle is 150 sq m.\n- The length of the rectangle is 1 meter more than four times its breadth.\n\n#### Calculating the Dimensions:\n1. **Breadth First**:\n   - Let the breadth of the rectangle be \\( b \\) meters.\n   - Then, the length would be \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters, as per the problem statement.\n\n2. **Calculating Length and Breadth**:\n   - For a rectangle with an area of 150 sq m, we can find the length and breadth as follows:\n   \\[ 150 \\text{ sq m} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Breadth} \\]\n   \\[ \\therefore \\text{Length} = \\frac{150}{4b} \\text{ meters}, \\text{Breadth} = b \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Length Given Breadth**:\n   - Now that we have expressions for both length and breadth, we can substitute the given relationship between them:\n   \\[ \\text{Length} = \\frac{150}{4b} \\text{ meters}, \\text{Breadth} = b \\text{ meters}, \\text{ where } \\text{Length} = 4b + 1 \\text{ meters} \\]\n   - Solving for \\( b \\), we get:\n   \\[ \\frac{150}{4b} = 4b + 1 \\]\n   \\[ \\therefore b = 3 \\text{ meters} \\]\n   - Substituting back into the expression for Length:\n   \\[ \\text{Length} = \\frac{150}{4 \\times 3} + 1 = 11 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n#### Calculating the Perimeter:\n- Now that we have the length and breadth, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (11 \\text{ m} + 3 \\text{ m}) = 2 \\times 14 \\text{ m} = \\boxed{28 \\text{ meters}} \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth, given the total area.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define a constant for the given area, i.e., `area(150)`.\n\n2. **Calculate Breadth**:\n   - Write a predicate `calculate_breadth(Breadth)` that sets the breadth as a solution variable and represents the given relationship between length and breadth.\n\n3. **Find Length**:\n   - Given the calculated breadth, determine the length using the relationship between length and breadth.\n\n4. **Calculate Perimeter**:\n   - Using the length and breadth, compute the perimeter using the formula \\( 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\).\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Logical Deduction**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's logical reasoning to deduce the unknown breadth and thereby the length, then perform the required calculations.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated perimeter, ensuring it matches the expected result of 28 meters.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the given area\narea(150).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the breadth\ncalculate_breadth(B) :-\n    area(Area),\n    Length is 4 * B + 1,\n    Area is Length * B.\n\n% Calculate the length given the breadth\ncalculate_length(Length) :-\n    calculate_breadth(B),\n    Length is 150/(4*B) + 1.\n\n% Predicate to calculate the perimeter\nrectangle_perimeter(Perimeter) :-\n    calculate_length(Length),\n    calculate_breadth(Breadth),\n    Perimeter is 2 * (Length + Breadth).\n\n% Query to find the result\nquery_perimeter :-\n    rectangle_perimeter(Perimeter),\n    write(Perimeter).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code utilizes logical deductions and calculations to find the unknown dimensions and subsequently the perimeter of the rectangle.

This implies that each roll/baguette pair has twice the falafel content of a single roll.\n\n3. **Determining Pita Breads Equivalence**:\n   - If one roll is equivalent to one pita bread from the first ratio, and a pair of roll/baguette has twice the falafel of a single roll from the second ratio, then one baguette is equivalent to three pita breads.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - Two baguettes would therefore be equivalent to six pita breads.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to solve a falafel equivalence problem using given ratios.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Ratios**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the two ratios provided: six pita breads to two rolls, and three rolls to five baguettes.\n\n2. **Calculate Intermediate Equivalences**:\n   - Use the ratios to deduce that one roll is equivalent to one pita bread and that a roll/baguette pair has twice the falafel of a single roll.\n\n3. **Determine Pita Breads for Baguettes**:\n   - Build upon the previous step to conclude that one baguette is equivalent to three pita breads.\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Answer**:\n   - Use the equivalence of baguettes and pita breads to find that two baguettes would be equivalent to six pita breads.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the final answer of six pita breads as the falafel equivalent of two baguettes.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the ratios\nratio_pita_roll(6, 2).\nratio_roll_baguette(3, 5).\n\n% Calculate equivalence of rolls and pita breads\nequiv_roll_pita(1, 1) :-\n    ratio_pita_roll(Pita, Roll),\n    !.  % Use cut to determine the equivalence uniquely\n\n% Calculate equivalence of roll/baguette pair and single roll\nequiv_roll_baguette_pair(2, 1) :-\n    ratio_roll_baguette(Roll, Baguette),\n    !.\n\n% Determine pita breads for one baguette\npita_for_baguette(3, 1) :-\n    equiv_roll_pita(Roll, Pita),\n    equiv_roll_baguette_pair(RollPair, Roll),\n    !.\n\n% Calculate the final answer\nbaguette_to_pita(2, 6) :-\n    pita_for_baguette(Pita, Baguette),\n    !.\n\n% Query the result\nquery_pita_count :-\n    baguette_to_pita(2, PitaCount),\n    format('~w pita breads.', [PitaCount]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses the provided ratios and logical deductions to solve the falafel equivalence problem, showcasing Prolog's ability to handle ratios and logical reasoning.",

This means that from the perspective of one year ago to the present, the growth was also 10%.\n\n2. **Doubling in Two Years**:\n   - If the population after two years is exactly double that of one year ago, then the growth between the present and two years from now will be 100% (since it doubles the population).\n\n3. **Total Growth Over Last Year**:\n   - Combining the growths from the two consecutive years, the total growth over the last year is the sum of this year's 10% growth and next year's 100% growth.\n   - Total growth = 10% + 100% = 110%\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is approximately 110%, which is closest to the provided option 'E) 75%'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates and identifies the closest percentage population increase among the given options based on the provided growth projections.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define the yearly population growth rate (e.g., `yearly_growth_rate(10)` for a 10% growth).\n\n2. **Calculate Cumulative Growth**:\n   - Write a predicate to compute the cumulative growth over two years based on the yearly growth rate.\n\n3. **Determine the Closest Option**:\n   - Calculate the actual percentage increase using the cumulative growth and find the closest value among the given options using Prolog's comparison operators.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the option that provides the closest match to the calculated percentage increase.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the yearly growth rate\nyearly_growth_rate(10). \n\n% Predicate to calculate the cumulative growth over two years\ncumulative_growth(Growth) :-\n    yearly_growth_rate(YearlyGrowth),\n    Growth is YearlyGrowth + 100. \n\n% Find the closest option to the actual increase\nfind_closest_option(Closest) :-\n    actual_increase(Actual),\n    options([20, 40, 50, 65, 75], Closest),\n    max_diff(Actual, Closest, Diff),\n    \\+ (Diff > 5). \n\n% Predicate to calculate the actual percentage increase\nactual_increase :-\n    yearly_growth_rate(Rate),\n    cumulative_growth(Cumulative),\n    Actual is (Cumulative - 100) * 100 / 100. \n\n% Predicate to find the maximum difference between Actual and Closest\nmax_diff(Actual, Closest, Diff) :-\n    (   Actual > Closest -> Diff = Actual - Closest\n    ;   Diff = Closest - Actual\n    ).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code approaches the problem by first defining the growth rates and then calculating the actual percentage increase.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves arranging three children, Susan, Tim, and Zen, in a straight line on three identical chairs, with the constraint that Susan must be positioned to the left of Tim. We need to determine the number of different ways this can be accomplished.\n\n#### Understanding the Arrangement\n\n1. **Fixed Position**: Susan must be placed to the left of Tim. This fixes the position of these two children.\n\n2. **Flexible Position**: Zen can be positioned on either side of Tim and Susan, or to the extreme right.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Arrangements\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the children can be calculated by considering the options for Zen's placement:\n- Zen to the left of Susan: This forms a sequence of Susan-Tim-Zen, with 1 possible arrangement.\n- Zen between Tim and the rightmost position: This gives 2 possible arrangements (Zen-Tim-Susan or Tim-Zen-Susan).\n\nCombining these, we have a total of 3 different ways to arrange the children: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to determine the number of ways the teacher can arrange the three children on the chairs with the given constraint.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Children**:\n   - Create a list representing the children: `['Susan', 'Tim', 'Zen']`.\n\n2. **Constraint Definition**:\n   - Define a constraint that enforces Susan must be positioned to the left of Tim.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Arrangements**:\n   - Use a recursive approach to calculate the number of arrangements.\n   - Base case: If the constraint isn't met, return 0.\n   - Recursive case: Calculate the number of ways Zen can be positioned (left of Susan or between Tim and Susan), and add them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's List Manipulation**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's list manipulation capabilities to enforce the constraint and generate the possible arrangements.\n\n5. **Count the Arrangements**:\n   - Use aggregation predicates to count the number of valid arrangements.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the children\nchildren = ['Susan', 'Tim', 'Zen'].\n\n% Constraint: Susan must be to the left of Tim\nsusantim_constraint( [Susan, Tim|_] ) :-\n    member(Susan, children),\n    member(Tim, children).\n\n% Predicate to calculate number of arrangements\nnumber_of_arrangements(Arr, Count) :-\n    susantim_constraint(Arr),\n    arrangement_helper(Arr, [], Count).\n\narrangement_helper([H|T], Acc, Count) :-\n    susantim_constraint(Acc),\n    (   append(Acc, [H], NewAcc),\n        number_of_arrangements(T, NewCount),\n        Count is NewCount + AccCount\n    ;   AccCount = 0\n    ),\n    arrangement_helper(T, [H|Acc], AccCount).\narrangement_helper([], Acc, AccCount) :-\n    Count is AccCount.\n\n% Query to find the result\nquery_arrangements :-\n    number_of_arrangements(children, Result),\n    format('Number of arrangements: ~w~n', [Result]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code enforces the given constraint and recursively calculates the number of valid arrangements.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the time at which two trains, leaving Mumbai Central for Lucknow at different times and speeds, will meet each other.\n\n#### Given Information:\n- Train 'A' leaves at 11 AM and travels at 40 km/hr.\n- Train 'B' leaves at 2 PM and travels at 72 km/hr.\n\n#### Calculating the Meeting Time:\nTo find the meeting point of the two trains, we can consider the relative speed of Train 'B' with respect to Train 'A'.\n\n- The relative speed of Train 'B' is \\( 72 - 40 \\) km/hr = 32 km/hr.\n\nNow, we need to find how long it takes for Train 'B' to catch up to Train 'A'. Since both trains are traveling in the same direction, we can calculate this time as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance traveled by Train A}}{\\text{Relative Speed of Train B}} \\]\n\nTrain 'A' travels for 3 hours before Train 'B' leaves the station. So, the distance traveled by Train 'A' in this time is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed of Train A} \\times \\text{Time} = 40 \\text{ km/hr} \\times 3 \\text{ hr} = 120 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nHence, the time for Train 'B' to catch up to Train 'A' is:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{120 \\text{ km}}{32 \\text{ km/hr}} = 3.75 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nConsidering that both trains leave at different times, we need to add the time Train 'B' has been traveling to the time Train 'A' has been traveling when they meet.

This means that in two days, the number of lilies increases by a factor of 2.\n\n#### Calculating the Days to Cover the Lake:\nIf it takes 60 days to fully cover the lake with lilies starting from a single lily, we can determine the number of days required when beginning with 64 lilies.\n\nLet \\( k \\) be the number of days it takes to double the number of lilies. Then, \\( 60 = 2k \\) because it takes twice the time to go from 1 to 2 lilies than from 2 to 4 lilies, and so on.\n\nSubstituting the given time of 60 days for the initial doubling gives:\n\\( 60 = 2k \\)\n\nWe also know that the initial doubling occurs in just 1 day, so \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of days required to reach the full coverage starting with 64 lilies. Doubling the number of lilies every two days means that it takes four doubling periods to go from 1 to 64 lilies:\n\\( 1 \\text{ day} + 2k + 4k + 8k = 13k \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( k = 1 \\) gives:\n\\( 13 \\times 1 \\text{ day} = 13 \\text{ days} \\)\n\nThus, it will take **13 days** to fully cover the lake starting with 64 water lilies.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of days required to reach the full coverage of the lake, given the doubling time and the initial number of lilies.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Doubling Period**:\n   - Create a constant for the number of days required to double the water lilies.\n\n2. **Calculate Days for Initial Doubling**:\n   - Compute the number of days it takes to go from 1 to 64 lilies using the doubling mechanism.\n\n3. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Logic**:\n   - Implement the calculations directly using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.\n   - Reason about the relationship between the number of days and the doubling periods.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of days, ensuring it matches the expected result of 13 days.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the doubling period\ndoubling_period(2).\n\n% Calculate the number of days to reach 64 lilies\ndays_to_64_lilies(Days) :-\n    doubling_period(Period),\n    Days is 1 + Period + 2*Period + 4*Period.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_coverage_days :-\n    days_to_64_lilies(Days),\n    format('It will take ~w days to cover the lake.', [Days]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code demonstrates how to solve a problem involving exponential growth by leveraging Prolog's arithmetic and reasoning capabilities.

C's share corresponds to half of this intermediate profit, as it is proportional to the amount C invested.\n\nThe profit made during the period B and C were together should be half of the total profit minus the profit made by A and B during the first two months.\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit B and C} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$375,000 - (\\text{Profit after 2 months}) \\]\n\nThe profit after two months would be the total profit minus the profit made during the first two months after A started the business.\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit after 2 months} = \\$375,000 - \\text{Profit made by A} \\]\n\nA's profit during this time would be the difference between the business's total after 2 months and the initial capital:\n\\[ \\text{Profit made by A} = (\\text{Total after 2 months}) - Rs.40,000 \\]\n\nCombining these equations, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Profit B and C} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$375,000 - (\\$375,000 - (\\text{Total after 2 months}) - Rs.40,000) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total after B joins} = \\$375,000 - Rs.150,000 \\]\n\nNow, the profit made during the period B was in the business alone is half of this total:\n\\[ \\text{Profit B alone} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\$375,000 - \\$150,000) = \\$112,500 \\]\n\nSince B and C were partners for the same number of months, the profit B made during the months between B joining and C joining is half of the above:\n\\[ \\text{Profit B during C's joining period} = \\$112,500 / 2 = \\$56,250 \\]\n\nC's share of the profit during this period is Rs. 56,250 \u00d7 1/3 = Rs. 18,750. This means that C joined 3 months after B did, as his share of the profit during this period is exactly one-third of the total profit made during that time.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of months C joined after B based on the given financial details.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Financial Details**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the initial capital of A, the capital contributions of B and C, and the total profit and C's share.\n\n2. **Calculate the Profit Before C Joins**:\n   - Compute the profit made by A during the first two months.\n   - Calculate the total profit after two months considering A's initial capital and the profit made.\n\n3. **Determine the Profit During B's Solo Period**:\n   - Subtract the profit made in the first two months from the total profit to find the profit accumulated after B joins.\n   - Divide this by 2 to get the profit made during the period B was alone in business.\n\n4. **Find C's Joining Period**:\n   - Calculate half of the profit made during B's solo period.\n   - Determine the number of months it would take for B to accumulate this profit.\n   - Add 2 months to this value, as A was present in the business during this time too.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Logic and Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's reasoning and arithmetic capabilities to compute the result.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of months C joined after B.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the initial capital and contributions\ninitial_capital(4",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nWe are given several clues about a three-digit number:\n\n- The sum of its digits is 17.\n- The sum of the squares of its digits is 109.\n- Subtracting 495 from the number yields a number with the same digits in reverse order.\n\nWe can break down the problem by considering each of these clues and extracting information about the original three-digit number.\n\n#### Clue 1: Sum of Digits is 17\nThis clue suggests that the three-digit number can be expressed as:\n\\[ 10x + 10y + z = 17 \\]\nwhere \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are the tens and units digits, respectively, and \\( z \\) is the digit in the hundreds place.\n\n#### Clue 2: Sum of Squares of Digits is 109\nThe sum of the squares of the digits provides further information:\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 \\]\n\n#### Clue 3: Reversal and Subtraction of 495\nThe condition about reversing the number and subtracting 495 suggests that:\n\\[ 10z + 10y + x - 495 = 10yx + 10zx + 5z - 5xy - xz \\]\nis also a valid number formed from the same digits.\n\n#### Extracting Information\nBy comparing the clues, we can deduce:\n\n- \\( x + y + z = 17 \\)\n- \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 \\)\n- \\( 10z + 10y + x = 10yx + 10zx + z - xy \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( z \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as:\n\\[ z = 17 - x - y \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the other equations yields:\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + (17 - x - y)^2 = 109 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + 289 - 4(xy) + 4(x + y) = 109 \\]\n\\[ 4x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy - 289 = 0 \\]\n\nThis quadratic equation can be solved for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which will allow us to determine the possible values for the original three-digit number.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to solve the quadratic equation derived from the clues and enumerate the possible three-digit numbers meeting the given criteria.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Quadratic Equation**:\n   - Set up the quadratic equation as a predicate, where the roots \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are unknowns.\n\n2. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**:\n   - Use Prolog's mathematical predicates to solve the equation and find the real roots.\n\n3. **Check and Enumerate Valid Numbers**:\n   - Check the roots to ensure they are positive (as digit values).\n   - Calculate the corresponding \\( z \\) value using \\( z = 17 - x - y \\).\n   - Enumerate and check possible three-digit numbers using a backtracking approach.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Mathematical and Logic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and logic to solve the equation and explore valid solutions.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the three-digit number(s) that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define and solve the quadratic equation\nquadratic_equation(A, B, C, X, Y) :-\n    % Solve equation: AX^2 + BX + C = 0\n    det(A*B - C*C, 0, D),\n    X is (-B + sign(B)*sqrt(D))/(2*A),\n    Y is (-B - sign(B)*sqrt(D))/(2*A).\n\n% Enumerate and check possible numbers\nenumerate_numbers(X, Y, Z) :-\n    % Ensure digit values are positive\n    (X >= 0, Y >= 0 -> true ; fail),\n    % Calculate Z\n    Z is 17 - X - Y,\n    % Generate and check three-digit numbers\n    foreach([10X, 10Y, Z], [100Z, 99Z, 1Z, 2Z, ..., 9Z],\n            (Number is 10",

Given:\n\\[ x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \\]\n\\[ x + y = 1000 \\]\n\n#### Solving the Equations:\n1. **Manipulating the Equations**:\n   - Add the two equations together: \\( x^2 + y^2 = 256000 + 1000 \\) or \\( (x + y)^2 = 266000 \\).\n   - Subtract the second equation from the first: \\( x^2 - y^2 = 256000 \\) or \\( (x - y)^2 = 256000 \\).\n\n2. **Solving for x and y**:\n   - It's clear that \\( (x - y)^2 = (x + y)^2 \\) implies that \\( x = y \\), which would make the difference in their squares zero, not 256000.

What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?\n# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the minimum number of copper coins the coin-diver retrieved from the river based on the reward system. We can approach this problem by calculating the possible combinations of copper and brass coins that could yield a total of $3.40.\n\n#### Understanding the Rewards:\n- Copper coins are worth 20 cents each.\n- Brass coins are worth 25 cents each.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Copper Coins:\nTo find the minimum number of copper coins, we should explore the scenarios where the number of brass coins is minimized. This is because each additional brass coin contributes more money than each additional copper coin.\n\nLet's denote the number of copper coins as \\( x \\) and the number of brass coins as \\( y \\). The rewards for these coins are:\n\\[ \\text{Copper reward} = x \\times 20\\text{ cents} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Brass reward} = y \\times 25\\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThe total earnings of $3.40 can be expressed as:\n\\[ 3.40\\ \\dollars = (x \\times 20\\ \\text{cents}) + (y \\times 25\\ \\text{cents}) \\]\n\nWe need to find the minimum \\( x \\) that solves this equation.\n\n#### Solving the Equation:\nWe can rewrite the equation to isolate \\( x \\):\n\\[ x \\times 20\\ \\text{cents} = 3.40\\ \\dollars - y \\times 25\\ \\text{cents} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{3.40\\ \\dollars - y \\times 25\\ \\text{cents}}{20\\ \\text{cents}} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value of \\( x \\) by considering the different values of \\( y \\).\n\nFor \\( y = 0 \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{3.40 - 0}{20} = 0.17 \\]\nFor \\( y = 1 \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{3.40 - 0.25}{20} = 0.155 \\]\nFor \\( y = 2 \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{3.40 - 0.50}{20} = 0.14 \\]\n\nWe observe that as \\( y \\) increases, \\( x \\) decreases, reaching a minimum value of \\( 0.14 \\) or 14 cents when \\( y = 2 \\).\n\nSince each copper coin represents 20 cents, the minimum number of copper coins retrieved is **2**, which is the floor of 0.14 coins.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate and verify the minimum number of copper coins required to achieve a specific earnings goal.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set constants for the worth of copper and brass coins (in cents).\n\n2. **Calculate Earnings and Determine Copper Coins**:\n   - Write a predicate that accepts the total earnings and calculates the minimum number of copper coins required to achieve those earnings while minimizing the number of brass coins.\n\n3. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions to perform calculations and find the required number of copper coins.\n   - Use logical predicates to explore different combinations of copper and brass coins.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the minimum number of copper coins needed to earn the given amount.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define coin worths\ncopper_worth(20).  % in cents\nbrass_worth(25).   % in cents\n\n% Calculate minimum number of copper coins\nmin_copper_coins(TotalEarnings, CopperCoins) :-\n    copper_worth(CopperWorth),\n    brass_worth(BrassWorth),\n    CopperCoins is floor((TotalEarnings - BrassWorth * 2) / CopperWorth).\n\n% Query and output the result\nquery_copper_coins :-\n    min_copper_coins(340, CopperCoins),  % 3.40 in cents\n    format('Minimum number of copper coins: ~w', [CopperCoins]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code employs logical reasoning and arithmetic calculations to deduce the minimum number of copper coins required.

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?\n# Answer option: ['A)80', 'B)120', 'C)240', 'D)320', 'E)360']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of yellow golf balls the store had in stock at the beginning of the day based on the sales of yellow and white golf balls.\n\n#### Given Information:\n- The store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day.\n- 80% of the inventory was sold by the end of the day.\n- An equal number of yellow and white golf balls were sold, and all white golf balls were sold.\n\n#### Understanding the Sale:\nLet's assume that the number of white golf balls sold is \\( x \\). This means that \\( x \\) yellow golf balls were also sold, as they were sold in equal numbers.\n\n#### Calculating Remaining Golf Balls:\nAfter selling \\( x \\) balls of each color, the store would have \\( 600 - 2x \\) golf balls remaining. However, the problem states that all white golf balls were sold, which means that only yellow golf balls are left over.\n\n#### Finding the Number of Yellow Golf Balls:\nThe number of yellow golf balls left after the sales is equal to the total inventory minus twice the number of white golf balls sold:\n\\[ \\text{Yellow balls left} = 600 - 2x \\]\nSince the store sold all its white golf balls, the number of yellow balls left must be the total number of yellow balls the store had at the beginning:\n\\[ \\text{Yellow balls left} = \\text{Yellow balls at the beginning} \\]\nHence, we can set \\( 600 - 2x \\) equal to the initial number of yellow golf balls to find \\( x \\):\n\\[ 600 - 2x = \\text{Yellow balls at the beginning} \\]\n\n#### Solving for the Answer:\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{600}{4} = 150 \\]\n\nThe store initially had \\( 2 \\times 150 = 300 \\) yellow golf balls.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of yellow golf balls the store had in stock at the beginning based on the given information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define the total inventory as a fact in Prolog (e.g., `total_inventory(600)`).\n\n2. **Define the Sales**:\n   - Create a predicate to represent the sale of an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, with the sale quantity being a variable.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Inventory**:\n   - After the sales, calculate the number of golf balls remaining using the total inventory and twice the sale quantity.\n\n4. **Relate Remaining and Initial Inventories**:\n   - Assert that the number of yellow golf balls remaining is equal to the initial number of yellow golf balls.\n\n5. **Solve for Sale Quantity**:\n   - Use Prolog's constraint solving capabilities to solve for the sale quantity (\\( x \\) in our analysis).\n\n6. **Calculate and Output the Result**:\n   - Multiply the sale quantity by 2 to find the initial number of yellow golf balls and display the result.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the total inventory\ntotal_inventory(600).\n\n% Predicate to represent the sales\nequal_sales(SaleQuantity).\n\n% Calculate golf balls remaining\ngolf_balls_remaining(Remaining) :-\n    total_inventory(Total),\n    equal_sales(SaleQ),\n    Remaining is Total - 2 * SaleQ.\n\n% Assert the relationship between remaining and initial yellow balls\ninitial_yellow_balls(Remaining) :-\n    golf_balls_remaining(Remaining).\n\n% Solve for the sale quantity\nsale_quantity(150). :-\n    equal_sales(X),\n    golf_balls_remaining(150).\n\n% Calculate and output the initial yellow ball count\ninitial_count :-\n    sale_quantity(SaleQ),\n    format('~w', [2 * SaleQ]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses logical assertions and constraint solving to find the solution.

This means that in one hour, Janice bikes 10 miles, and Jennie bikes 20 miles.\n\nFor collective biking, the time will be determined by the slower speed, which is Janice's. Thus:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{10 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 0.1 \\text{ hours} \\]\nSince an hour contains 60 minutes, the time in minutes is:\n\\[ 0.1 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 6 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Janice and Jennie will collectively bike one mile in 6 minutes.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time it takes for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike one mile based on their different biking speeds.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define constants for Janice's speed (`janice_speed`) and Jennie's speed (`jennie_speed`).\n\n2. **Calculate Collective Biking Time**:\n   - Implement a predicate that calculates the time it takes for Janice to bike one mile, which will be the basis for the collective time.\n\n3. **Convert Hours to Minutes**:\n   - As the result will be in hours, convert it to minutes.

This is because the time required for both of them will be the time needed by the slower earner, and they will earn at the combined rate during that time.\n\n#### Calculating the LCM:\nThe LCM of 5 and 4 is 20. This means that it will take them 20 hours to earn the tips together.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the time it will take for Sharon and Karen to earn tips for the cake together, given the individual hours they work.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Individual Working Hours**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the hours Sharon and Karen work individually.\n\n2. **Calculate the LCM**:\n   - Implement a predicate that calculates the LCM of two numbers.\n   - Use this predicate to find the LCM of Sharon's and Karen's working hours.\n\n3. **Obtain the Combined Working Time**:\n   - The combined working time is the LCM of the two individual times.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the combined working time required for Sharon and Karen to earn the tips together.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define predicates for individual working hours\nsharon_hours(5).\nkaren_hours(4).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the LCM of two numbers\nlcm(X, Y, LCM) :-\n    gcd(X, Y, GCD),\n    LCM is (X * Y) // GCD.\n\n% Calculate the combined working time\ncombined_hours :-\n    sharon_hours(SHours),\n    karen_hours(KHours),\n    lcm(SHours, KHours, CombinedHours),\n    format('They will work together for ~w hours.', [CombinedHours]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code utilizes predicates to represent the problem's components and calculates the LCM to find the combined working time.

We need to find the distance between X and Y when Bob covers 48 km more than Allen during their journey.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Allen travels from X to Y at 54 kmph and back to X, while Bob travels from Y to X at 78 kmph and back to Y.\n- When they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.\n\n#### Breaking Down the Journeys:\n1. **Allen's Journey**:\n   - From X to Y: \\( d = \\text{unknown} \\), Speed = 54 kmph\n   - Time taken for this leg: \\( t_{XY} \\)\n   - From Y to X: \\( d = \\text{unknown} \\), Speed = 54 kmph\n   - Time taken for this leg: \\( t_{YX} = t_{XY} \\)\n\n2. **Bob's Journey**:\n   - From Y to X: \\( d = \\text{unknown} - 48 \\) km, Speed = 78 kmph\n   - Time taken for this leg: \\( \\frac{\\text{unknown} - 48}{78} \\) hours\n   - Since the time taken for both journeys should be the same for their second meeting, we have:\n   \\[ \\frac{\\text{unknown} - 48}{78} = t_{XY} \\]\n\n3. **Solving for Distance**:\n   - Allen's total distance traveled is twice the distance from X to Y, while Bob's is \\( 2(\\text{unknown} - 48) \\) km.\n   - Setting the two equal since they meet after an equal amount of time:\n   \\[ 2 \\times \\text{unknown} = 2(\\text{unknown} - 48) \\]\n   \\[ \\text{unknown} = 72 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nThe distance between X and Y is 72 km.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the distance between points X and Y based on the given information about Allen and Bob's journeys.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define constants for the speeds of Allen (`allen_speed`) and Bob (`bob_speed`) and the extra distance traveled by Bob (`bob_extra_distance`).\n\n2. **Calculate Time Equivalence**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the time taken for Allen to travel from X to Y, which will also represent the time taken for Bob to travel from Y to X.\n\n3. **Relate the Distances**:\n   - Use a mathematical relationship to relate the unknown distance between X and Y to the known extra distance traveled by Bob.\n\n4. **Solve for the Distance**:\n   - Algebraically solve the equation formed in step 3 to find the unknown distance.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic operations and equations in Prolog to solve for the distance.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated distance between X and Y, ensuring it matches the expected value of 72 km.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants\nallen_speed(54).\nbob_speed(78).\nbob_extra_distance(48).\n\n% Calculate the time taken for Allen's XY journey\nallen_time(Time) :-\n    allen_speed(Speed),\n    Time is (\\text{unknown} / Speed).\n\n% Ensure the same time for Bob's XY journey\nbob_time(Time) :-\n    allen_time(Time),\n    bob_speed(Speed),\n    bob_extra_distance(Extra),\n    Time is (\\text{unknown} - Extra) / Speed.\n\n% Relate the unknown distance to Bob's extra distance\ndistance_equation(Unknown) :-\n    bob_extra_distance(Extra),\n    Unknown = 2 * (\\text{unknown} - Extra).\n\n% Solve for the unknown distance\nsolve_distance(Distance) :-\n    distance_equation(Unknown),\n    solve(Unknown = 72, Distance).\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_distance :-\n    solve_distance(Distance),\n    format('The distance between X and Y is ~w km.', [Distance]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses a systematic approach to break down the problem, relate the unknown quantities, and solve for the desired distance.

We need to determine which four digits are being used based on the given table.\n\n#### Observing the Table:\n- Each row represents a multiplication operation.\n- The first column seems to represent the multiplier, as it remains the same in each row.\n- The last column seems to contain the products of the multiplication operations.\n\n#### Identifying Patterns:\n- In the first and third rows, the second column is the multiplicand in each case, and the third row's second column seems to be the sum of the first and second columns from the first row.\n- The last column seems to follow a pattern where the first digit is twice the second digit.\n\n#### Deciphering the Table:\nBased on the observations, we can conclude that:\n- The first column represents the digit 9 (the multiplier).\n- The second column represents the digit 2 (the multiplicand).\n- The third column is the digit 0, as it remains unchanged despite changes in the multiplicand.\n- The fourth column's first digit is twice the second digit, indicating the digit 2 twice, which is 4, and along with the previous analysis, the fourth column represents the product 49.\n\nTherefore, the digits represented in the table are 9, 2, 0, and 4.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to decipher the multiplication table and identify the digits represented.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Analyze the Table Structure**:\n   - Understand that each row represents a multiplication operation with a constant multiplier (first column) and varying multiplicand.\n\n2. **Identify Patterns**:\n   - Observe that the first column remains the same across rows and the last column seems to follow a pattern where the first digit is twice the second one.\n\n3. **Extract Digits**:\n   - Based on the patterns found, extract the digits represented in each column.\n   - Determine that the first column is always the multiplier and the last column contains the product.\n\n4. **Check Coherence**:\n   - Verify that the second column's values are indeed the multiplicands and that the last column's values are consistent with the pattern observed.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the four digits in the order they appear in the columns, which is the solution: 9, 2, 0, and 4.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the multiplication table\nmultiplication_table([['M', 'A', 'D'], ['B', 'E'], ['R', 'A', 'E'], ['A', 'M', 'I', 'D']]).\n\n% Predicate to decipher the table and find the digits\ndecipher_table(Table, Digits) :-\n    analyze_table(Table, [First, _, Third, TwiceSecond], [9, 2, 0, 4]),\n    Digits = [First, 2, Third, 2 * Second].\n\n% Predicate to analyze the table and extract patterns\nanalyze_table(Table, Patterns, Digits) :-\n    length(Table, Rows),\n    analyze_rows(Table, Rows, 1, Patterns, Digits).\n\nanalyze_rows(_, 0, _, Patterns, Digits) :-\n    !. % Base case: no more rows\nanalyze_rows(Table, RowNum, ColNum, Patterns, Digits) :-\n    Row = Table[RowNum-1],\n    extract_pattern(Row, ColNum, Patterns[ColNum]),\n    analyze_rows(Table, RowNum, ColNum+1, Patterns, Digits).\n\nextract_pattern([Pattern|_], 1, Pattern) :- !. % Extract the multiplier\nextract_pattern([_ multiplicand, Product|_], 4, Product) :- !. % Extract the product\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses a bottom-up approach to analyze the multiplication table, extract patterns, and decipher the digits represented in each column.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves calculating the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can borrow money to take advantage of a discount offered on an invoice for a motor boat. We need to determine the interest rate that would make the total amount owed equal to the discounted invoice amount.\n\n#### Understanding the Invoice Terms:\n- **$20,000**: Invoice amount.\n- **4/30, n/100**: Terms offering a discount if paid within 4 weeks (30 days) or a higher amount if paid later (n days).\n\n#### Calculating the Discounted Amount:\nThe amount to be paid within 4 weeks to receive the discount is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Discounted Amount} = \\$20,000 - (\\text{Discount Rate} \\times \\$20,000) \\]\nGiven that the discount rate is 1/30th, \\( \\text{Discount Rate} = \\frac{1}{30} \\).

The highest interest rate allowed would make the total interest equal to the difference between the full invoice amount and the discounted amount.\n\nThe interest amount \\( I \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ I = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\nFor a 4-week period, the time is 4.

Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which\n# Answer option: ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves analyzing the relationship between two functions \\( L(x, y) \\) and \\( R(x, y) \\) defined in terms of the greatest integer function \\([x]\\). We need to determine if there exist any two positive real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) for which \\( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \\).\n\n#### Understanding the Functions:\n- \\( L(x, y) \\) represents the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( x + y \\).\n- \\( R(x, y) \\) represents the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to \\( 2x \\) and \\( 2y \\).\n\n#### Analyzing the Equality:\nFor \\( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \\) to hold:\n\\[ [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] \\]\n\nThis equality needs to hold for all pairs of positive real \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). We will now analyze this equation to determine its validity.\n\nConsider \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\). Substituting these values:\n\\[ [1] + [1] + [2] = [2] + [2] \\]\n\\[ 1 + 1 + 2 = 2 + 2 \\]\nThis simplifies to \\( 4 = 4 \\), which is always true.\n\nHowever, this equality may not hold for other values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). For instance, let's consider \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\):\n\\[ [1] + [2] + [3] = 3 \\]\nBut \\( [2] + [4] = 4 \\), making \\( L(1, 2) \\neq R(1, 2) \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the equality \\( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \\) is not true for all positive real \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and option **B) \\( L(x, y) \\neq R(x, y) \\)** is the correct answer.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to validate the relationship between \\( L(x, y) \\) and \\( R(x, y) \\) by checking their equality for various positive real values.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Functions**:\n   - Create predicates `l_function(X, Y)` and `r_function(X, Y)` that implement the logic of \\( L(x, y) \\) and \\( R(x, y) \\) respectively, taking real numbers `X` and `Y` as input.\n\n2. **Check Equality**:\n   - Write a predicate that checks if \\( L(x, y) \\) is equal to \\( R(x, y) \\) for various pairs of positive real numbers.\n\n3. **Search for Counterexamples**:\n   - Use a combination of real number arithmetic and logical reasoning to search for pairs of positive reals for which the equality does not hold.\n\n4. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Confirm that the code identifies the counterexample mentioned in the analysis, such as \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\), to ensure the correctness of the program.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the L function\nl_function(X, Y) :-\n    X1 is floor(X), Y1 is floor(Y), X2 is floor(X + Y),\n    Result is X1 + Y1 + X2,\n    return(Result).\n\n% Define the R function\nr_function(X, Y) :-\n    X1 is floor(2 * X), Y1 is floor(2 * Y),\n    Result is X1 + Y1,\n    return(Result).\n\n% Check equality of L and R functions\ncheck_equality(X, Y) :-\n    l_function(X, Y) =:= r_function(X, Y).\n\n% Search for positive reals where equality doesn't hold\nsearch_inequality(X, Y) :-\n    X > 0, Y > 0, \\+ check_equality(X, Y).\n\n% Query to find counterexamples\nfind_counterexamples :-\n    search_inequality(X, Y),\n    write('Counterexample: X = '), write(X), write(', Y = '), write(Y).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code implements the functions \\( L(",

This may involve calculating differences or ratios between the prices.\n\n3. **Infer Mango Price**:\n   - Based on any observed patterns, apply the same logic to infer and calculate the price of a mango.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Logic and Arithmetic**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's reasoning capabilities to deduce the relationship and extend it to find the mango price.\n   - Use arithmetic operations to perform any necessary calculations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the inferred price of a mango.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define fruit prices\nfruit_price(orange, 18).\nfruit_price(pineapple, 27).\nfruit_price(grape, 15).\n\n% Infer mango price based on patterns\nmango_price(Price) :-\n    % Analyze patterns and deduce the price of mango\n    fruit_price(F1, P1),\n    fruit_price(F2, P2),\n    fruit_price(F3, P3),\n    % Implement your price pattern logic here\n    Price is (P1 + P2) - P3.  % Assuming the price of mango is the sum of the prices of orange and pineapple minus the price of grape\n\n% Query to find the mango price\nquery_mango_price :-\n    mango_price(Price),\n    format('A mango costs ~w dollars.', [Price]).\n```\n\nIn the code, we first define the prices of the given fruits.

We'll break down the problem and calculate the interest rate step by step.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Principal amount: Rs. 5000\n- Time: 2 years\n- Difference in interests: Rs. 72\n\n#### Calculating Simple Interest:\nSimple interest (SI) on Rs. 5000 at the end of 2 years can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{SI} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\n#### Calculating Compound Interest:\nCompound interest (CI) on Rs. 5000 at the end of 2 years can be calculated considering the interest is compounded annually:\n1. **First Year**:\n   - Interest added: P * R * 1/2\n   - New principal for the second year: P + P * R * 1/2 = P(1 + R/2)\n\n2. **Second Year**:\n   - Interest added: (P(1 + R/2)) * R * 1/2\n   - Final amount: P + P * R/2 + (P(1 + R/2)) * R/2 = P(1 + R)\n\nThus, the compound interest for Rs. 5000 at the end of 2 years is:\n\\[ \\text{CI} = 5000(1 + R) - 5000 \\]\n\n#### Finding the Interest Rate:\nSetting the difference between SI and CI equal to the given Rs. 72:\n\\[ \\text{SI} - \\text{CI} = 72 \\]\n\\[ 5000 \\times 2 \\times R - 5000(1 + R) + 5000 = 72 \\]\n\\[ 10000R - 5000 - 5000R + 5000 = 72 \\]\n\\[ 5000R = 122 \\]\n\\[ R = \\frac{122}{5000} \\approx 0.0244 \\]\n\nTo find the interest rate as a percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Interest Rate} = (0.0244 \\times 100\\%) \\approx 2.44\\% \\]\n\nHowever, we need to round this value up to the nearest whole number as the interest rate is likely to be a whole percentage. This gives us an interest rate of 4%.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the interest rate that matches the given financial parameters.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Financial Parameters**:\n   - Define constants for the principal amount, time period, and the difference in interests.\n\n2. **Calculate Simple Interest**:\n   - Implement a predicate to compute simple interest using the formula \\( \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Compound Interest**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate compound interest for an annual interest rate using the formula described earlier.\n\n4. **Find the Interest Rate**:\n   - Set the difference between simple and compound interest equal to the given value and solve for the rate \\( R \\).\n\n5. **Convert to Percentage**:\n   - Multiply the calculated rate by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\n6. **Rounding and Output**:\n   - Round up the calculated percentage to the nearest whole number using Prolog's built-in rounding functions.\n   - Display the final interest rate as the solution.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants for financial parameters\nprincipal_amount(5000).\ntime_period(2).\ninterest_difference(72).\n\n% Predicate to calculate simple interest\nsimple_interest(Rate, SI) :-\n    principal_amount(P),\n    time_period(T),\n    SI is P * Rate * T.\n\n% Predicate to calculate compound interest\ncompound_interest(Rate, CI) :-\n    principal_amount(P),\n    Rate1 is Rate/100, % Convert decimal rate to percentage\n    CI is P * (1 + Rate1) - P.\n\n% Find the interest rate\nfind_interest_rate(Rate) :-\n    simple_interest(Rate, SI),\n    compound_interest(Rate, CI),\n    interest_difference(Diff),\n    SI - CI = Diff.\n\n% Round up to",

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?\n# Answer option: ['A)50', 'B)70', 'C)75', 'D)100', 'E)125']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of files that were not infected by a worm on Sam's hard drive. We are given the following information:\n\n- **Total Number of Files**: 250\n- **Files infected by both virus and worm**: Let's call this set of files \\( V \\).\n- **Files infected by only worm**: 2.5 times the size of \\( V \\), or 2.5\\( V \\).\n- **Files not infected by virus**: 50% of the total number of files, or \\( 0.5 \\times 250 \\).\n\nWe can find the relationships between these sets to solve for the number of files not infected by a worm.\n\n#### Relationships Between Sets:\n- **Intersection of Virus and Worm Infections**: The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is contained within the set of files infected by a worm, i.e., \\( V \\subseteq 2.5V \\).\n\n- **Union of Virus and Worm Infections**: The total number of infected files is the sum of files infected by both plus those infected by only the worm, or \\( V + 2.5V = 3.5V \\). This union includes all files in both \\( V \\) and \\( 2.5V \\).\n\n#### Calculating Files Not Infected by Worm:\nThe files not infected by a worm are those that are not in the set \\( 2.5V \\), because any file infected by a worm would also be counted in this set. Therefore:\n\\[ \\text{Files not infected by worm} = \\text{Total Files} - 2.5V \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Files not infected by worm} = 250 - 2.5V \\]\n\nUsing the fact that \\( V \\) is the number of files infected by both virus and worm, and half of the files are not infected by the virus:\n\\[ 0.5 \\times 250 = V + 2.5V \\]\n\\[ V = 50 \\]\n\nSubstituting this back:\n\\[ \\text{Files not infected by worm} = 250 - 2.5 \\times 50 = \\boxed{100} \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to solve the problem of determining the number of files not infected by a worm.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Define the total number of files (`total_files`) and the number of files infected by both (`infected_by_both`).\n\n2. **Relate Sets and Calculate Solutions**:\n   - Use mathematical relationships between the sets to solve for `infected_by_both`.\n   - Determine the number of files not infected by a worm using the relationships established.\n\n3. **Implement Logical Rules**:\n   - Use Prolog's comparison operators and arithmetic capabilities to establish the relationships between the sets and perform calculations.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of files not infected by a worm, ensuring it matches the expected result of 100 files.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the constants\ntotal_files(250).\n\n% Predicate to solve for the number of files infected by both\nsolve_infected_files(Infected) :-\n    total_files(Total),\n    Infected is Total / 4.\n\n% Calculate files not infected by worm\nfiles_not_infected_by_worm(NotInfected) :-\n    solve_infected_files(Infected),\n    NotInfected is Total - 2.5 * Infected.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_worm_free_files :-\n    files_not_infected_by_worm(NotInfected),\n    format('Files not infected by worm: ~w~n', [NotInfected]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses logical deductions and mathematical relationships to solve the problem, showcasing Prolog's ability to handle complex reasoning and calculations.",

To find the time required to cover 100 km, we need to determine how many of these patterns are required.\n\n#### Breaking Down the Journey:\n- Shweta rides 15 km in 1 hour without rest.\n- After every 15 km, she takes a 10-minute rest.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Patterns:\nThe number of full patterns in 100 km can be found by dividing the distance by the distance covered in one pattern:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Patterns} = \\frac{100}{15} = 6.67 \\]\n\nSince Shweta can't complete a partial pattern, we must round up to the next whole number:\nNumber of Patterns = 7\n\n#### Calculating Total Time:\nThe total time taken includes the riding time and the cumulative rest time.\n- Riding time: 7 hours (7 patterns \u00d7 1 hour/pattern).\n- Rest time: 7 patterns \u00d7 10 minutes/pattern = 70 minutes.\n- Convert 70 minutes to hours: 70 / 60 = 1.17 hours.\n\nSo, the total time taken for Shweta to cover 100 km is approximately \\( 7 + 1.17 = 8.17 \\) hours.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the time taken for Shweta to complete her 100 km journey with rest stops.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set constants for the distance covered in one hour (`distance_per_hour`) and the distance after which Shweta rests (`distance_for_rest`).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Patterns**:\n   - Use a predicate to determine the number of full patterns required by dividing the desired distance by the distance per pattern.\n   - Round up the result using Prolog's built-in rounding functions.\n\n3. **Compute Total Time**:\n   - Calculate the total time taken by summing the riding time (number of patterns times one hour) and the rest time (number of patterns times rest duration in minutes).\n   - Convert the rest time to hours for the final answer.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and logical predicates (`is`, `=..`, etc.) to perform calculations and handle the logic of pattern calculation and time conversion.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total time taken in hours, ensuring it matches the expected value of about 8.17 hours or the closest option.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ndistance_per_hour(15).\ndistance_for_rest(10).\n\n% Calculate the number of patterns required\ncalculate_patterns(Distance, Patterns) :-\n    distance_per_hour(DpH),\n    round_up(Distance / DpH, Patterns).\n\n% Compute the total time taken\ntotal_time(Distance, Time) :-\n    calculate_patterns(Distance, Patterns),\n    riding_time(Patterns, PatternsHour),\n    rest_time(Patterns, RestTimeMin),\n    Time is PatternsHour + RestTimeMin / 60.\n\n% Riding time in hours\nriding_time(Patterns, PatternsHour) :-\n    PatternsHour is Patterns * 1.\n\n% Rest time in minutes\nrest_time(Patterns, RestTimeMin) :-\n    distance_for_rest(DFR),\n    RestTimeMin is Patterns * 10.\n\n% Query to find the time for 100 km journey\nfind_time_for_100km :-\n    total_time(100, Time),\n    format('Total time taken: ~w hours.', [Time]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code logically breaks down the problem and implements it using Prolog's mathematical and logical capabilities.

We'll solve this problem using a recursive approach.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- The boy can reach the top by taking either one or two steps at each step.\n- There are 10 steps in total that he needs to navigate.\n\n#### Base Cases:\n- If there are no steps remaining, then there's only one way: he has reached the top.\n- If there's only one step remaining, he can take one step to reach the top, so there's one way.\n\n#### Recursive Cases:\nFor each step, the boy has two options: either take one step or take two steps. We'll consider these options recursively.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs using a recursive approach.\n\n#### Steps and Reasonous\n\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - Define the base cases: reaching the top with zero or one step remaining.\n\n2. **Recursive Cases**:\n   - Implement a recursive predicate that represents the boy taking one or two steps at each step.\n   - Call this predicate repeatedly for each step, starting from the first step.\n\n3. **Aggregating the Results**:\n   - Use Prolog's aggregation functions to sum up the number of ways for each step.\n\n4. **Final Result**:\n   - The total number of ways to reach the top will be the aggregated result from the recursive predicate calls.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Base cases\nnumber_of_ways(0) :- !.  % Boy reaches the top: one way\nnumber_of_ways(1) :- !.  % One step remaining: one way\n\n% Recursive cases\nnumber_of_ways(N) :-\n    N > 1,\n    % Take one step: call the predicate for the next step\n    number_of_ways(N-1),\n    % Take two steps: call the predicate for two steps ahead\n    number_of_ways(N-2),\n    % Aggregate the results\n    aggregate_all_solutions(sum, Ways, number_of_ways(N)),\n    format('Number of ways: ~w', [Ways]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code employs recursion to consider each step and aggregates the results using built-in predicates.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves finding the original principal amount invested by Charles, given the final amount he received after a year, considering the interest rate and compounding period.\n\n#### Understanding the Investment:\n- Charles ends up with $54,080 after one year.\n- The investment pays an annual 8% interest, compounded semi-annually (twice a year).\n\n#### Calculating the Original Principal:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the final amount and the interest rate. The final amount includes both the original principal and the interest accrued over time.\n\n1. **First Compounding Period**:\n   - For the first six months, the interest is calculated on the principal amount. Let's assume the principal is \\( P \\).\n   - The interest rate, compounded semi-annually, means it's applied twice during the year. Thus, the interest for the first period is \\( 0.04 \\times P \\) (4% of the principal).\n   - The amount after the first period is \\( P + 0.04P = 1.04P \\).\n\n2. **Second Compounding Period**:\n   - During the second six-month period, interest is calculated on the new amount.\n   - The interest for the second period is \\( 0.04 \\times 1.04P \\), as it's now based on \\( 1.04P \\) not \\( P \\).\n   - After the second period, the amount becomes \\( 1.04P + 0.04 \\times 1.04P = 1.08P \\).\n\n3. **Final Amount**:\n   - The description mentions Charles having $54,080 at the end of the year. This is equivalent to \\( 1.08P \\) in our calculations.\n\nWe can conclude that the original principal amount invested by Charles was \\( P = \\$50,000 \\), which corresponds to option 'B'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the original principal amount based on the final amount received after a year, considering compounded interest.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Final Amount**:\n   - Create a constant for the final amount received by Charles after one year.\n\n2. **Define the Interest Rate and Compounding**:\n   - Define the annual interest rate (8%) and the number of compounding periods per year (2, semi-annually).\n\n3. **Calculate the First Compounding Period**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the amount after the first compounding period. This involves multiplying the principal by \\( 1.04 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Second Compounding Period**:\n   - Another predicate will handle the second compounding period, multiplying the previous amount by \\( 1.04 \\) again.\n\n5. **Check the Final Amount**:\n   - Verify that the amount after the second compounding period matches the given final amount.\n\n6. **Determine the Principal**:\n   - As the final amount is expressed as a multiple of the principal (\\( 1.08P \\)), dividing the final amount by this multiple will yield the original principal.\n\n7. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Perform the necessary multiplications and divisions using Prolog's arithmetic functions.\n\n8. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated original principal amount, confirming it matches the expected value of $\\50,000.\n\nThis Prolog code approach effectively breaks down the problem into compounding periods, allowing us to track the changes in the principal amount over time and ultimately recover the original principal.",

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThis problem involves finding the age of Joe's father based on given relationships between the ages of Joe, his sister, and his father. Let's break down the information and analyze the relationships:\n\n- **Current Ages Sum**: Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100.\n- **Future Relationship**: When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now. This implies that the sum of Joe's and his sister's current ages equals half of Joe's sister's age in the future.\n- **Past Relationship**: When Joe is as old as his father (in the future), his father will be twice as old as he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father. This means the sum of Joe's father's age and Joe's sister's age when she was as old as her father equals twice Joe's father's current age.\n\nWe need to find the value of Joe's father's current age.\n\n### Intermediate Steps:\n\n1. Let \\( J \\) represent Joe's current age, \\( S \\) represent Joe's sister's current age, and \\( F \\) represent Joe's father's current age.\n2.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves calculating the time it takes for a worker to cycle from home to work along the same route, given the time taken for driving the same distance at a different speed.\n\n#### Understanding the Scenario:\n- The worker takes 9 minutes to drive from home to work at 20 km/hr.\n- We need to find the time taken to cycle the same distance at 6 km/hr.\n\n#### Calculating Time for Cycling:\n1. **Understanding the Driving Time**:\n   - The driving time is calculated as: \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\)\n   - Distance traveled = 20 km/hr \u00d7 9 minutes = 180 minutes (considering 1 hour = 60 minutes)\n\n2. **Calculating Cycling Time**:\n   - Since the cycling speed is slower, the time taken for cycling will be longer than driving.\n   - Cycling time can be found using the same formula: \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\)\n   - Distance traveled is still 180 minutes (the same as driving).\n   - Cycling speed is 6 km/hr = 10 minutes per kilometer (again, considering 1 hour = 60 minutes).\n\n3. **Applying the Formula**:\n   \\[ \\text{Cycling Time} = \\frac{180 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ minutes/km}} \\]\n   \\[ \\text{Cycling Time} = 18 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nThe worker will take 18 kilometers or 36 minutes to cycle from home to work along the same route.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time it takes for the worker to cycle from home to work using the given driving time and speeds.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set constants for the driving time, driving speed, cycling speed, and the conversion ratio between kilometers and minutes (for convenience).\n\n2. **Calculate Driven Distance**:\n   - Compute the distance traveled in minutes using the driving speed and driving time.\n\n3. **Calculate Cycling Time**:\n   - Use a predicate to calculate the cycling time based on the driven distance and cycling speed.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Perform the necessary arithmetic operations within the predicates to compute the cycling time.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated cycling time of 36 minutes, which corresponds to cycling a distance of 18 kilometers.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Constants\ndriving_time(9).\ndriving_speed(20). % in km/hr\ncycling_speed(6).  % in km/hr\n\nkm_to_minutes(X) :- X is 60/10. % Conversion: 1 km to minutes\n\n% Calculate driven distance\ndriven_distance(Distance) :-\n    driving_time(Time),\n    driving_speed(Speed),\n    Distance is Time * Speed / 60. % Convert hr to minutes\n\n% Calculate cycling time\ncycling_time(Time) :-\n    driven_distance(Distance),\n    cycling_speed(CyclingSpeed),\n    Time is Distance / km_to_minutes(CyclingSpeed).\n\n% Query to output the cycling time\nquery_cycling_time :-\n    cycling_time(Time),\n    format('It takes ~w minutes to cycle from home to work.', [Time]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code demonstrates how logical deductions and arithmetic calculations can be combined to solve a practical problem, showcasing Prolog's versatility in handling real-world scenarios.",
