This approach also makes the code modular and easier to understand or modify."

So, the total amount paid back after 12 months is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Paid Back} = 12 \\times Rs.~31.50 = Rs.~378 \\]\n\nSince the man borrowed Rs. 360, the interest charged over the loan period is:\n\\[ \\text{Interest} = \\text{Total Paid Back} - \\text{Principal} = Rs.~378 - Rs.~360 = Rs.~18 \\]\n\nNow, to find the interest rate, we need to relate this Rs. 18 to the total amount borrowed. The interest rate (\\( R \\)) can be found using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Interest} = P \\times R \\times \\text{Number of Years} \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is the principal amount and \\( \\text{Number of Years} \\) is the loan period in years.\n\nIn this case, the loan period is one year (12 months).

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves calculating the probability of a man catching the first train at a railway station where two trains operate on different lines with a frequency of 10 minutes each. Let's analyze this scenario:\n\n#### Train Arrival Frequencies:\n- Both the harbor line and main line trains arrive every 10 minutes.\n\n#### Arrival Times:\n- The main line train starts at 5:00 AM.\n- The harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM.\n\nTo catch the first train, the man needs to arrive at the platform during the first 10 minutes of the hour, i.e., between 5:00 AM and 5:10 AM. However, there's a twist because the harbor line train arrives two minutes later than the main line train. This means that during the first 10 minutes, the main line train has a higher chance of being the first one the man encounters.\n\n#### Probability Calculation:\nThe probability of the man catching the first train can be approached as the probability of him arriving at the platform during the first eight minutes of the hour (to catch the main line train), because the harbor line train's two-minute delay increases the main line train's probability of being the first.\n\nThe man's arrival time is random, so we can assume a uniform distribution of arrival times. This means that the probability of him arriving within any eight-minute interval is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of the total time.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, considering the dual train schedules.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Time Frames**:\n   - Establish the relevant time frames: The first eight minutes (for the main line train) and the remaining two minutes (for either train).\n\n2. **Calculate Probabilities**:\n   - Compute the probability of the man arriving during the first eight minutes, which is \\( \\frac{8}{10} \\) or 0.8.\n   - Similarly, calculate the probability of him arriving during the remaining two minutes, which is \\( \\frac{2}{10} \\) or 0.2.\n\n3. **Determine the Final Probability**:\n   - Combine the probabilities from the two time frames. The probability of the man catching the first train is higher if he arrives during the initial eight minutes.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's truth maintenance and logical reasoning capabilities to deduce the final probability.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated probability of catching the first train.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the probabilities based on time frames\nfirst_train_probability(Probability) :-\n    main_line_probability(0.8),\n    either_train_probability(0.2),\n    Probability is 0.8 + 0.2.\n\nmain_line_probability(P) :- ! , P is 8/10.\n\neither_train_probability(P) :- ! , P is 2/10.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code leverages the logic and probability handling capabilities to solve the problem.

However, since M and N are permutations of each other, the tens digit of M must be greater than the units digit of N, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Range of Values**:\n   - Given these constraints, we can enumerate the possible tens and units digits for M and verify if they satisfy the condition and equation.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to enumerate and count the valid values of M based on the given condition and equation.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Constraints**:\n   - Define facts or assertions in Prolog to represent the condition M > N and the equation M - N + 396c = 990.\n\n2. **Explore Possible Tens and Units Digits**:\n   - Use a combination of facts and predicates to explore all possible tens and units digits for M, given the constraint that M > N.\n\n3. **Check Validity**:\n   - Write a predicate to check if each candidate value of M satisfies the equation and condition.\n\n4. **Count Valid Values**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in counting capabilities or a custom predicate to tally the number of valid values found in the previous step.\n\n5. **Display the Result**:\n   - Present the final count of valid values, which corresponds to the number of values of M greater than 300.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the constraints and equation\ncondition(M) :- M > 99.                 % M must be greater than 99 (N)\nequation(M) :- M - N + 396 * M // 100 = 990. % Extract the hundreds digit of M is 3\n\n% Explore and count valid values\ncount_valid_values(Count) :-\n    findall(M, (between(100, 999, M), condition(M), equation(M), valid_value(M)), List),\n    length(List, Count).\n\n% Predicate to check if a value of M is valid\nvalid_value(M) :- ...  % Define the logic here\n```\n\nThis approach uses Prolog's ability to reason about permutations and equations to solve the problem efficiently.

The LCM of 1/13 and 1/7 is 91/7, which corresponds to 12 full rotations for both balls.\n\n4. **Time for Common Multiple**: Now, we can calculate the time needed for both balls to complete 12 rotations.\n   - For Ball A: 12 rotations in 26 minutes, or 26/2 minutes per rotation.\n   - For Ball B: 12 rotations in 35 minutes, or 35/5 minutes per rotation.\n\n5. **Time Calculation**: Multiplying the number of rotations by the time per rotation for each ball:\n   - Ball A: 12 rotations x 26/2 minutes = 39 minutes.\n   - Ball B: 12 rotations x 35/5 minutes = 42 minutes.\n\n6. **Common Time**: The highest common time among the two is 42 minutes, which is the time required for both balls to reach the same starting point again.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to compute the time it takes for both balls to reach their starting positions simultaneously.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set facts for the time taken by Ball A and Ball B to complete certain rotations.\n\n2. **Calculate Partial Rotations per Minute**:\n   - Compute the partial rotations completed by each ball in 1 minute.\n\n3. **Find LCM of Rotations**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to find the LCM of the rotations completed in one minute by each ball.\n\n4. **Calculate Time for Common Multiple**:\n   - Multiply the LCM of rotations by the time required for each ball to complete one rotation.\n\n5. **Find the Maximum Time**:\n   - Determine the higher time between the two balls' travel times, as this will be the time they both reach the starting point simultaneously.\n\n6. **Convert to Hours and Minutes**:\n   - Convert the computed time from minutes to hours and minutes for the final answer.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the times for Ball A and Ball B\ntime_for_2_rotations(26).\ntime_for_5_rotations(35).\n\n% Calculate partial rotations per minute\nball_a_partial_rot(-1/13) :- time_for_2_rotations(Time), 1/2::Time/2.\nball_b_partial_rot(-1/7) :- time_for_5_rotations(Time), 1/5::Time/5.\n\n% Find the LCM of partial rotations\nlcm_rotations(91/7) :- ball_a_partial_rot(PA), ball_b_partial_rot(PB), lcm(PA, PB, LCM), number_of_rotations(LCM).\n\n% Calculate time for common multiple of rotations\ncommon_multiple_time_a(39) :- lcm_rotations(LCM), time_for_2_rotations(Time), LCM::Time/2.\ncommon_multiple_time_b(42) :- lcm_rotations(LCM), time_for_5_rotations(Time), LCM::Time/5.\n\n% Find the time they meet simultaneously\nsimultaneous_time :- common_multiple_time_b(TimeB), common_multiple_time_a(TimeA), max(TimeA, TimeB).\n\n% Convert to hours and minutes for the final answer\nhours(H) :- simultaneous_time(M",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining when C joined the business based on the provided financial details. We can approach this problem by analyzing the amounts invested and profits shared by the partners.\n\n#### Understanding the Partnerships:\n- A starts the business with Rs. 40,000 and is joined by B after 2 months with Rs. 60,000.\n- At some later point, C joins the business with Rs. 120,000.\n- C's share of the profit is Rs. 150,000.\n\n#### Breaking Down the Profits:\n1. **Profit Before C**:\n   - For the first 2 months, only A and B are partners. Their combined investment is Rs. 40,000 + Rs. 60,000 = Rs. 100,000.\n   - Assuming the profit is proportional to the investment, the profit made in this initial 2-month period is:\n   \\[ \\frac{\\text{Total Profit}}{\\text{Total Investment}} = \\frac{375000}{100000} \\]\n   \\[ \\therefore \\text{Profit Before C} = 75000 \\]\n\n2. **Calculating C's Share From A and B**:\n   - After C joins, the total investment becomes Rs. 100,000 (from A and B) + Rs. 120,000 (from C) = Rs. 220,000.\n   - If we assume the profit continues to be proportional to the investment, the profit made in the remaining months (after C joins) would be:\n   \\[ \\text{Profit After C Joins} = 375000 - 75000 = 300000 \\]\n   - C's share of this profit is Rs. 150,000.\n   - Therefore, the profit shared among A, B, and C in the months when all three were partners is:\n   \\[ \\text{Profit Shared Among A, B, and C} = \\frac{150000}{\\text{Total Investment After C Joins}} = \\frac{150000}{220000} \\times 300000 = 112,500 \\]\n\n3. **Determining the Number of Months**:\n   - To find out when C joined, we need to determine when the profit reached Rs. 112,500.\n   - Since the business started with Rs. 100,000 and made a profit of Rs. 75,000 in the first 2 months, we can calculate the profit per month as:\n   \\[ \\text{Profit Per Month} = \\frac{75000}{2} = 37,500 \\]\n\n#### Final Calculation:\n- C joined the business 4 months after B.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate and infer the number of months it took for C to join the business based on the given financial details.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Financial Details**:\n   - Define facts for the initial investments by A, B, and C, as well as C's share of the profit.\n\n2. **Calculate Profit Distribution Before C**:\n   - Compute the total profit made before C joined by assuming a constant profit-to-investment ratio.\n\n3. **Determine C's Share From A and B**:\n   - Calculate the profit shared between A and B during the months when the three partners were together.\n\n4. **Find the Joining Month**:\n   - Use a recursive predicate to iterate through months, accumulating profit until it matches C's share.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of months it took for C to join the business after B.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the investments and profit share\ninvestment_A(40000).\ninvestment_B(60000).\ninvestment_C(120000).\nc_share(150000).\n\n% Calculate the profit made before C joins\nprofit_before_C(TotalProfit) :-\n    investment_A(A),\n    investment_B(B),\n    TotalProfit is (100000 * 37500) // 100000.\n\n% Calculate the profit shared among A, B, and C\nprofit_shared_ABC(Amount) :-\n    investment_A(A),\n    investment_B(B",

For every 10 pens produced, 1 is defective, so they produce 11 pens for every 10 functional pens promised.\n\n2. **Cost before Profit**:\n   - The company sells 10 functional pens for Rs. 100 (10 pens \u00d7 Rs. 10 each).\n   - With a 25% profit margin, the cost before profit is Rs. 80 (100 / (1 + 25%)).\n\n3. **Adjusting for Rejection**:\n   - Of the pens manufactured, 10% are defective, so only 90% are functional.\n   - The functional pens' cost is Rs. 80 / 0.90, which is Rs. 88.89.\n\nThe manufacturing cost of each pen, before considering the defective rate, is Rs. 88.89 / 11, which is approximately Rs. 8.08.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to compute the manufacturing cost per pen, given the provided scenario.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define constants for the defective rate (`defective_rate`, e.g., 0.1 for 10%), the promised delivery amount (`promised_delivery`, 7200 pens), the selling price (`selling_price`, Rs. 10), and the profit margin (`profit_margin`, 25%).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Manufactured Pens**:\n   - Compute the number of pens manufactured, accounting for the rejection rate. This can be done using simple arithmetic.\n\n3. **Determine Cost before Profit**:\n   - Calculate the total cost before considering profit by multiplying the selling price with the number of promised deliveries and then adjusting for the profit margin.\n\n4. **Adjust for Rejection**:\n   - Further adjust the cost by considering the rejection rate. This involves dividing the cost by the probability of a pen being functional (1 - `defective_rate`).\n\n5. **Calculate Manufacturing Cost per Pen**:\n   - Divide the adjusted cost by the number of manufactured pens to find the manufacturing cost per pen.\n\n6. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the calculations directly using Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining which statements are true about a positive integer Q that has 5 factors. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**I. Q is the square of a prime number:**\n   - For a number to have 5 factors, it must be of the form \\( p^2 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. Prime numbers have two factors (1 and itself), and squaring it results in four more factors (p2, -p2, p^2, and -p^2), making a total of five.\n\n\n**II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number:**\n   - This statement does not guarantee that Q has 5 factors. A fourth power of a prime number has too many factors (e.g., 2^4 = 16 has 8 factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, -1, -2, -4, -8).\n\n\n**III. Q is the product of two prime numbers:**\n   - When two prime numbers are multiplied, each prime contributes its factors, resulting in four factors total (assuming neither is 1). However, this does not account for the fifth factor required for Q.\n\nStatement I is the only one that is necessarily true for a positive integer with 5 factors.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that verifies which statements are true for a positive integer with 5 factors.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Predicate**:\n   - Create a predicate that accepts a positive integer `Q` as input and checks the stated conditions.\n\n2. **Check Each Condition**:\n   - For Condition I: Check if Q is the square of a prime number by determining if it's a perfect square and then confirming that the square root is a prime.\n   - For Condition III: Factorize Q using Prolog's built-in predicates and check if it's the product of two distinct prime numbers.\n\n3. **Output the Result**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in predicates to determine the truth value of each statement and combine them to find the correct option.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to check the conditions\ncheck_statements(Q) :-\n    % Check Condition I\n    is_square_of_prime(Q),\n    % Check Condition III\n    factorize(Q, Factors),\n    is_product_of_two_primes(Factors).\n\n% Predicate to check if Q is a square of a prime\nis_square_of_prime(Q) :-\n    % Check if Q is a perfect square\n    sqrt(Q, Int),\n    % Check if the square root is a prime\n    prime_number(Int).\n\n% Predicate to check if the factorization shows two distinct prime factors\nis_product_of_two_primes([P, P]) :- !, P > 1.\nis_product_of_two_primes([P1, P2]) :-\n    P1 > 1, P2 > 1, P1 =\\= P2.\n\n% Use Prolog's built-in factorization predicate\nfactorize(Q, Factors) :-\n    factors(Q, Factors).\n\n% Check if a number is prime\nprime_number(X) :-\n    X > 1,\n    X = 2 ;  % 2 is the only even prime\n    \\+\u53ef\u9664\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5(X, 2, Xdiv2).\n\n% Divisibility test\nX = Y mod Z :- X div Z = Y.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code utilizes Prolog's built-in predicates for factorization and arithmetic to efficiently check the conditions and determine the correct answer.

How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only?

We need to account for all the different ways we can choose the presenters.\n\n#### Total Combinations:\nFor the second selection step, we can choose any two of the four women for the presenting team. This gives $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways. Similarly, this can be multiplied by the number of ways to choose two men, giving us 6 $\\times$ 6 = 36 combinations.\n\nAdding the two sets of combinations, we get 6 + 36 = 42 combinations for the two genders. \n\nThis means there are a total of 420 different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team to fulfill the criteria.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the given team composition while adhering to the given constraints.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Team Composition**:\n   - Use Prolog facts to represent the number of men and women in the team.\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations**:\n   - Write predicates to calculate combinations for selecting two men and two women.\n   - Use the binomial coefficient (\\( \\binom{n}{r} \\)) to compute these combinations.\n\n3. **Determine Total Groups**:\n   - Multiply the combinations of men and women to get the total number of groups.\n   - Account for half of the combinations being identical by dividing by 2.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Mathematical Functions**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and logical reasoning to compute the combinations and perform the calculations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the final count of different groups of presenters, which should be 420.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the number of men and women\nnum_men(4).\nnum_women(4).\n\n% Predicate to calculate combinations\ncombinations(N, R, Result) :-\n    Result is binomial(N, R).\n\n% Calculate combinations for men and women\ncomb_men :-\n    num_men(M),\n    combinations(M, 2, comb_men_res).\ncomb_women :-\n    num_women(W),\n    combinations(W, 2, comb_women_res).\n\n% Compute total groups\ntotal_groups :-\n    comb_men,\n    comb_women,\n    TotalGroups is (comb_men_res * comb_women_res) / 2,\n    format('Total groups: ~w~n', [TotalGroups]).\n\n% Initiate the calculations\nmain :-\n    total_groups.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code follows the structured approach outlined in the plan, allowing for a clear and concise implementation of the problem solution, thereby showcasing Prolog's ability to handle combinatorial problems.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem describes a scenario where two friends, P and Q, are eating candies from a jar together, and we need to determine how long it will take them to empty the jar. We're given the individual eating rates for P and Q.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes.\n- Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes.\n\n#### Rate of Joint Eating:\nTo find the time it takes to empty the jar together, we should consider that:\n1. P's rate of eating is twice as fast as Q's (since Q eats half the jar in the same time P eats the whole jar).\n\n2. When eating together, the jar empties at the combined rate of both their individual rates.\n\n#### Calculating the Time:\nThe time it takes to empty the jar is determined by the slower eating rate between P and Q. Since P eats twice as fast as Q, we can find the time it takes Q to finish the entire jar.\n\n\\[ \\text{Time for Q to eat the entire jar} = \\frac{10}{5} \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, when they eat together, it will take them **2 minutes** to empty the jar, which corresponds to option 'B'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the time it takes for P and Q to empty the candy jar together, based on their individual eating rates.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define constants for the time it takes P and Q to finish the jar and half the jar, respectively.\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Eating Rate**:\n   - Determine that P's rate is twice that of Q's.\n\n3. **Find the Time**:\n   - Calculate the time it takes Q to finish the entire jar by scaling up the time to finish half the jar.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the time it takes for P and Q to empty the jar when eating together.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants for individual eating rates\ntime_for_p_to_finish_jar is 10.\ntime_for_q_to_finish_half_jar is 5.\n\n% Calculate time for Q to finish the entire jar\nq_finish_jar_time is time_for_q_to_finish_half_jar * 2.\n\n% Display the joint eating time\njoint_eating_time is q_finish_jar_time.\n\n% Output the result\nwrite(joint_eating_time).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code frames the problem in a straightforward manner, making the logic clear and concise, which is a strength of Prolog in handling such scenarios.",
