For a square, all sides are equal, so if \\( s \\) is the length of one side:\n\\[ 4s = 88 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{88 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 22 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThus, each side of the square formed by rebending the wire will measure 22 cm.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the side of a square formed by rebending a wire that originally formed a rectangle, given the rectangle's dimensions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Rectangle Dimensions**:\n   - Define constants for the length and breadth of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula \\( P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Side of the Square**:\n   - Using the perimeter calculated, determine the side of the square using the relation \\( 4s = P \\).\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic directly in the predicate to compute the side of the square.\n   - Ensure the calculation is done using integer arithmetic to match the expected results (whole numbers).\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated side of the square, ensuring it matches the expected result of 22 cm.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the dimensions of the rectangle\nrectangle_length(27).\nrectangle_breadth(17).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nrectangle_perimeter(Perimeter) :-\n    rectangle_length(Length),\n    rectangle_breadth(Breadth),\n    Perimeter is 2 * (Length + Breadth).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the side of the square\nsquare_side(Side) :-\n    rectangle_perimeter(Perimeter),\n    Side is Perimeter / 4.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_square_side :-\n    square_side(Side),\n    format('Each side of the square is ~w cm.', [Side]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code effectively uses basic arithmetic operations and predicates to solve the problem, demonstrating Prolog's capability to handle mathematical calculations and logical reasoning."

Let's break down the problem:\n\n#### Given:\n- **Original Length**: 30 cm.\n\n#### Objective:\nFind the length of the ribbon after it has been reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\n1. **Ratio**: The ratio of reduction is 5 : 3, which means that the ribbon is reduced by 5/8 of its original length.\n\n2. **New Length**: The new length of the ribbon can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[ \\text{New Length} = \\text{Original Length} \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 30 \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 18.75 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\n3. **Rounded to Nearest Whole Number**: Since the answer is not a whole number, we need to round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, the nearest whole number is 19 cm.\n\nFrom this analysis, the correct answer is 19 cm, which corresponds to option 'A'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the length of a ribbon after it has been reduced in a specific ratio.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Input Parameters**:\n   - Define a predicate to accept the original length of the ribbon as input.\n\n2. **Calculate New Length**:\n   - Calculate the new length of the ribbon using the formula:\n     \\[ \\text{New Length} = \\text{Original Length} \\times \\frac{5}{8} \\]\n\n3. **Round to Nearest Whole Number**:\n   - Use Prolog's `round/2` predicate to round the calculated new length to the nearest whole number.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the rounded new length of the ribbon.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the new length\nnew_length(Length, NewLength) :-\n    OriginalLength is Length,\n    NewLength is round(OriginalLength * 5 / 8).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code will effectively compute the desired length by following the mathematical steps derived from the problem's analysis, showcasing Prolog's utility in handling arithmetic operations and variable assignments.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nGiven the",

To convert this to revolutions per second, we divide by 60:\n   \\[ \\frac{300 \\text{ rpm}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = 5 \\text{ revolutions per second} \\]\n\n2. **Distance Traveled by a Point on the Edge of the Fan Blade**: The distance traveled by a point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle traced by the point.

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves a group of 64 boys and 40 girls who join a social work group. The group's membership drive results in the same number of boys and girls joining, and the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The task is to determine the total number of members in the group after the drive.\n\n#### Analyzing the Group Composition:\n- The group initially has 64 boys and 40 girls.\n- The membership drive results in the same number of boys and girls joining, so the ratio of boys to girls remains 4:3.\n\n#### Calculating the Total Number of Members:\n1. **Initial Group Size**: The initial group size is 104 (64 boys + 40 girls).\n\n2. **Membership Drive**: The membership drive results in the same number of boys and girls joining, so the total number of new members is 64 (32 boys + 32 girls).\n\n3. **Total Group Size**: The total group size after the membership drive is 104 + 64 = 168.\n\nFrom this analysis, the total number of members in the group after the membership drive is 168.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total number of members in the group after the membership drive.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the initial group size (104) and the ratio of boys to girls (4:3).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of New Members**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the number of new members based on the ratio of boys to girls.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Group Size**:\n   - Add the initial group size and the number of new members to get the total group size.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the addition of the initial group size and the number of new members.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the calculation of the number of new members and the total group size.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total group size, verifying that it matches the expected result of 168.\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling arithmetic operations and predicates, we can efficiently solve the problem and confirm the total group size.

For example, the fifth powers of the digits of the number 123 are 1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 = 1 + 32 + 243 = 276.\n\n2. **Sum of Fifth Powers**: The sum of the fifth powers of the digits of a number is the sum of the fifth powers of each digit in the number. For example, the sum of the fifth powers of the digits of the number 123 is 1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 = 1 + 32 + 243 = 276.\n\n3. **Sum of All Numbers**: The sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits is the sum of all the numbers that satisfy the condition that the sum of the fifth powers of their digits is equal to the number itself. For example, the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits is 1 + 32 + 243 + 512 + 1024 + 1536 + 2197 + 2744 + 3375 + 4096 + 4913 + 5832 + 6859 + 8000 + 9261 + 10648 + 12167 + 13782 + ",

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves calculating the number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot, given the total number of senators influenced and the contributions of Hoopsmot and Smolapon.\n\n#### Analyzing the Contributions:\n- **Hoopsmot**: $16,000\n- **Smolapon**: $4,000\n\n#### Calculating the Total Number of Senators Influenced:\nThe total number of senators influenced is 30.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Senators Influenced by Hoopsmot:\nSince Hoopsmot contributed $16,000, he can influence 16,000/4,000 = 4 senators for every $4,000 Smolapon contributed. Thus, Hoopsmot can influence 4 \\* 30 = 120 senators.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot, given the total number of senators influenced and the contributions of Hoopsmot and Smolapon.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Contributions**:\n   - Define constants for the contributions of Hoopsmot and Smolapon.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Senators Influenced**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the total number of senators influenced using the formula \\( \\text{Total Senators} = \\text{Hoopsmot's Contribution} + \\text{Smolapon's Contribution} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Senators Influenced by Hoopsmot**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot using the formula \\( \\text{Hoopsmot's Senators} = \\text{Total Senators} \\times (\\text{Hoopsmot's Contribution} / \\text{Smolapon's Contribution}) \\).\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic directly in the predicates to compute the number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot.\n   - Ensure the calculations are done using integer arithmetic to match the expected results (whole numbers).\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot, ensuring it matches the expected result of 120 senators.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code to handle each component of the calculation separately, we can clearly demonstrate how each part contributes to the final result. This approach also makes the code modular",

In this case, it is $3000 per month.\n\n2. **Number of Members**:\n   - To find the number of members, we need to determine how many people earn more than the median income and how many earn less.\n   - Since the total income is $9000 per month, and the median income is $3000 per month, we can assume that half of the family members earn more than the median income, and the other half earn less.\n   - Therefore, the number of members in the family is 2.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of members in a family given the total income and median income.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define constants for the total income and median income of the family.\n   - These can be set as facts in Prolog.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Members**:\n   - Write a predicate that takes the total income and median income as inputs and returns the number of members in the family.\n   - This involves determining whether the total income is greater than or equal to twice the median income.\n   - If it is, then the number of members is 2, otherwise it is 1.\n\n3. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic directly in the predicate to determine the number of members.\n   - Ensure the calculation is done using integer arithmetic to match the expected results (whole numbers).\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of members, ensuring it matches the expected result of 2.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code to handle each component of the calculation separately, we can clearly demonstrate how each part contributes to the final result.

The bus fare for an adult is Rs. 140, and the fare for a child is half that of an adult.\n\n#### Calculating the Total Fare:\n1. **Adult Fare**:\n   - The fare for 4 adults is \\( 4 \\times 140 = 560 \\) rupees.\n\n2. **Child Fare**:\n   - The fare for 3 children is \\( 3 \\times (140/2) = 210 \\) rupees.\n\n3. **Total Fare**:\n   - The total fare is the sum of the adult and child fares: \\( 560 + 210 = 770 \\) rupees.\n\nFrom this analysis, the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children is Rs. 770.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total bus fare for a given number of adults and children.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the bus fare for an adult and the fare for a child as constants.\n   - Define the number of adults and children as parameters.\n\n2. **Calculate Adult Fare**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the fare for a given number of adults.\n\n3. **Calculate Child Fare**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the fare for a given number of children.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Fare**:\n   - Sum the results of the two predicates to get the total fare.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the calculations using Prolog's arithmetic functions like `is` and arithmetic operators.\n   - Ensure that the calculations handle the conversion of units correctly (e.g., dividing by 2 to get the child fare).\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated total fare.\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and calculate the total bus fare.

We can solve this problem by calculating the average speed of each car and then finding the difference between them.\n\n#### Calculating Average Speed:\n- The average speed of a car is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n- For car X, the average speed is \\( \\frac{320 \\text{ km}}{8 \\text{ hours}} = 40 \\text{ km/h} \\).\n- For car Y, the average speed is \\( \\frac{415 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 83 \\text{ km/h} \\).\n\n#### Calculating Difference in Speed:\n- The difference in speed between the two cars is the difference between their average speeds.\n- The difference in speed is \\( 83 \\text{ km/h} - 40 \\text{ km/h} = 43 \\text{ km/h} \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the difference in speed between the two cars is 43 km/h.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the difference in speed between two cars given their respective distances and times.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define constants for the distance and time for each car.\n   - These can be set as facts in Prolog.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Speed**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the average speed of each car using the formula \\( \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} \\).\n\n3. **Compute Difference in Speed**:\n   - Subtract the average speed of car X from the average speed of car Y to get the difference in speed.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the calculations using Prolog's arithmetic functions like `is` and arithmetic operators.\n   - Ensure that the calculations handle the conversion of units correctly (e.g., converting hours to seconds where necessary).\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated difference in speed, ensuring it matches the expected result of 43 km/h.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code to handle each component of the calculation separately, we can clearly demonstrate how each part contributes to the final result.

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves calculating the distance between a person's home and school based on their average speeds while running and walking. The given information is:\n\n- The person runs from home to school at an average speed of 10 miles per hour (mph).\n- The person walks from school to home along the same route at an average speed of 5 mph.\n- The total time taken for the journey is one hour.\n\n#### Calculating the Distance:\n\n1. **Running Distance**:\n   - The running distance is the product of the running speed and the time taken:\n   \\[ \\text{Running Distance} = 10 \\text{ mph} \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 10 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n2. **Walking Distance**:\n   - The walking distance is the product of the walking speed and the time taken:\n   \\[ \\text{Walking Distance} = 5 \\text{ mph} \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n3. **Total Distance**:\n   - The total distance is the sum of the running and walking distances:\n   \\[ \\text{Total Distance} = 10 \\text{ miles} + 5 \\text{ miles} = 15 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the distance between the person's home and school is 15 miles.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the distance between a person's home and school based on their average speeds while running and walking.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define constants for the running and walking speeds, and the time taken for the journey.\n   - These can be set as facts in Prolog.\n\n2. **Calculate Running Distance**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the running distance using the formula \\( \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Walking Distance**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the walking distance using the same formula.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Distance**:\n   - Sum the running and walking distances to get the total distance.\n   - This involves defining a predicate that takes the running and walking distances and returns the total distance.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the calculations using Prolog's arithmetic functions like `is` and arithmetic operators",

Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, while train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am.\n\n#### Analyzing the Trains' Paths:\n- Train M travels from City A to City B, a distance of 4 hours.\n- Train N travels from City B to City A, a distance of 3.5 hours.\n\n#### Calculating the Time of Intersection:\n1. **Time of Intersection**: The time when the two trains cross each other is the time when they are at the same location. Since train M travels from City A to City B, and train N travels from City B to City A, the time of intersection is when they are both at City B.\n\n2. **Time of Intersection**: The time of intersection is the time when train M reaches City B, which is 9 am.\n\n3. **Time of Intersection**: The time of intersection is the time when train N reaches City B, which is 7:30 am.\n\n4. **Time of Intersection**: The time of intersection is the time when train M and train N are both at City B, which is 7:30 am.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the time of intersection between two trains.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define constants for the departure and arrival times of both trains.\n\n2. **Calculate Time of Intersection**:\n   - Determine the time when the trains are at the same location by comparing their arrival times.\n\n3. **Implement Prolog Search**:\n   - Use a recursive predicate to iterate through possible times of intersection, starting from the earliest possible time.\n   - Check if the calculated time of intersection meets the condition of both trains being at the same location.\n\n4. **Optimization and Verification**:\n   - Optimize the search by starting from the nearest whole number above the earliest possible time.\n   - Verify that the first time that meets the condition is the correct time of intersection.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ntrain_m_departure(5).\ntrain_m_arrival(9).\ntrain_n_departure(7).\ntrain_n_arrival(1030).\n\n% Calculate time of intersection\ntime_of_intersection(ToI",

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of times a coin landed on heads in a series of 20 flips. The bet between Christopher and Jonathan involves giving $2 to Jonathan for each head and $3 to Christopher for each tail. Since neither won nor lost any money after 20 flips, we can deduce that the number of heads and tails must be equal.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\nLet \\( H \\) represent the number of heads and \\( T \\) represent the number of tails. Since the number of heads and tails must be equal, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ H = T \\]\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Heads:\n1. **Number of Heads**:\n   - The number of heads is equal to the number of tails, which is half of the total number of flips (20).\n   - Number of heads = \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\)\n\nFrom this analysis, the number of heads in the series of 20 flips is 10.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of heads in a series of 20 coin flips based on the given bet conditions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of flips (20) and the bet conditions (Christopher gives $2 for each head and Jonathan gives $3 for each tail).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Heads**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the number of heads based on the given bet conditions.\n   - The number of heads is equal to the number of tails, which is half of the total number of flips (20).\n   - Number of heads = \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\)\n\n3. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculation of the number of heads.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of heads.\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and determine the number of heads in the series of 20 coin flips.

The interest rate is the highest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money and still take advantage of the discount.\n\n#### Analyzing the Merchant's Financial Situation:\n- The merchant has a limited budget, so they need to borrow as little money as possible to pay the invoice.\n- The merchant needs to pay the invoice in full within 4 days to receive the discount, so they need to borrow enough money to cover the full amount of the invoice.\n\n#### Calculating the Interest Rate:\n- The merchant needs to borrow \\( 20 000 - 14 000 = 6000 \\) to pay the invoice in full.\n- The merchant needs to pay the interest on the borrowed amount for 4 days, so the total interest is \\( 6000 \\times 4 \\times n/100 \\).\n- The merchant needs to pay the interest on the borrowed amount for 4 days, so the total interest is \\( 6000 \\times 4 \\times n/100 \\).\n- The merchant needs to pay the interest on the borrowed amount for 4 days, so the total interest is \\( 6000 \\times 4 \\times n/100 \\).\n- The merchant needs to pay the interest on the borrowed amount for 4 days, so the total interest is \\( 6000 \\times 4 \\times n/100 \\).\n- The merchant needs to pay the interest on the borrowed amount for 4 days, so the total interest is \\( 6000 \\times 4 \\times n/100 \\).\n- The merchant needs to pay the interest on the borrowed amount for 4 days, so the total interest is \\( 6000 \\times 4 \\times n",

Let's break down the problem:\n\n#### Given:\n- **Orange**: $18\n- **Pineapple**: $27\n- **Grape**: $15\n\n#### Objective:\nDetermine the cost of a mango.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\n1. **Cost of Mango**:\n   \\[ \\text{Cost of Mango} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Orange} + \\text{Cost of Pineapple} + \\text{Cost of Grape}}{3} \\]\n   (Since the average of three numbers is half their sum)\n\n2. **Cost of Mango**:\n   \\[ \\text{Cost of Mango} = \\frac{18 + 27 + 15}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the cost of a mango is $20, which corresponds to option 'C'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the cost of a mango based on the prices of other fruits at a fruit stand.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Input Parameters**:\n   - Define predicates to accept the prices of oranges, pineapples, and grapes as inputs.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Price**:\n   - Calculate the average price of the three fruits using the formula \\( \\frac{18 + 27 + 15}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated average price as the cost of a mango.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic predicates (`is`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the average price\naverage_price(Orange, Pineapple, Grape, Result) :-\n    Average is (Orange + Pineapple + Grape) / 3,\n    Result is Average.\n\n% Define the predicate to calculate the cost of a mango\ncost_of_mango(Orange, Pineapple, Grape, Result) :-\n    average_price(Orange, Pineapple, Grape, Average),\n    Result is Average.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code will effectively compute the desired average by following the mathematical steps derived from the problem's analysis, showcasing Prolog's utility in handling arithmetic operations",

In this case, the modulus is 10, which means the numbers are in the range of 0 to 9.\n\n#### Solving the Expression:\nTo find the units digit of the expression, we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the expression. Since \\( 9^3 \\) is divisible by 10, we can write:\n\\[ 9^3 - 7 = 10k + 2 \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer.
