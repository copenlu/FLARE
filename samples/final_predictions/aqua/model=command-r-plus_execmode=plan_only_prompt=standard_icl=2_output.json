So, the new distance traveled by the car to the height of the tower is also in the ratio of $\\sqrt{3}:1$.\n\n3. **Time to Reach the Base**: It took 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. During this time, the car covered a distance that made the ratio change from 1:1 to $\\sqrt{3}:1$.\n\n   Now, the car needs to cover the remaining distance to reach the base, which will maintain the $\\sqrt{3}:1$ ratio.\n\n   Let $x$ minutes be the required time to reach the base. Then, the car travels a distance that completes the ratio change:\n   \\[ \\left(1 + \\sqrt{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Distance traveled in 10 minutes}}{\\text{Distance traveled in } x \\text{ minutes}}\\right) \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[ x = 5\\left(\\sqrt{3} + 1\\right) \\]\n\nSo, the car will reach the base of the tower after $5\\sqrt{3} + 5 = 5\\sqrt{3} + 1$ minutes from the moment the angle of elevation was $45^\\circ$.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nTo create a SWI-Prolog program that calculates the time taken for a car, moving at a uniform speed, to reach the base of a vertical tower, given the change in the angle of elevation over a certain period.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Relationships**:\n   - Constants for the initial and final angles (45 degrees and 60 degrees), the time taken for the angle change (10 minutes), and the ratio of distance to height for a $45^\\circ$ angle (1:1).\n\n2. **Calculate Ratios**:\n   - Compute the ratio of distance to height for a $60^\\circ$ angle ($\\sqrt{3}:1$).\n   - Determine the overall ratio change using the initial and final ratios.\n\n3. **Compute Time to Reach Base**:\n   - Set up an equation relating the unknown time ($x$) to the given time intervals and ratio changes.\n   - Solve for $x$ to find the time required to reach the base.\n\n4. **Implement Trigonometric Functions**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic and trigonometric functions to calculate the tangent of the angles and perform the necessary calculations.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Ensure that the calculated time, $x$, satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n   - Verify that the code produces the expected result of $5\\sqrt{3} + 1$ minutes.\n\n6. **Code Structure**:\n   - Define predicates for calculating ratios, time, and verifying the solution.\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic and comparison operators to perform calculations and checks.\n\n### Prolog Code Outline\n\n ```prolog\n% Define constants\ninitial_angle(45).\nfinal_angle(60).\ntime_angle_change(10).\nratio_45(1, 1).\n\n% Calculate ratio for final angle\nratio_60(A,",

Thus, the correct answer is 20 hours.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the total journey duration of a train that experiences a speed change after covering a certain fraction of the distance.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Initialize the initial speed, final speed, initial distance, and fraction of distance covered when speed changes.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial and Additional Times**:\n   - Compute the time taken to cover the initial distance at the initial speed.\n   - Calculate the remaining distance after the speed change.\n   - Determine the additional time taken to cover the remaining distance at the final speed.\n\n3. **Compute Total Journey Duration**:\n   - Sum up the initial and additional times to find the total journey duration.\n\n4. **Implement Prolog Search and Logic**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the speed and distance calculations.\n   - Utilize predicates to organize the calculations for initial and additional times.\n   - Ensure that the program handles different scenarios, such as varying initial and final speeds, distances, and fractions of the distance.\n\n#### Code Outline:\n```prolog\n% Define constants and parameters\ninitial_speed(100).\nfinal_speed(75).\ndistance_fraction(1, 4).  % Covers 1/4 of the distance\n\n% Calculate initial time\ninitial_time(Time, Distance) :-\n    initial_speed(IS),\n    distance_fraction(DFrac, 1),\n    Time is Distance / (IS * DFrac).\n\n% Calculate remaining distance\nremaining_distance(Distance) :-\n    initial_distance(IDistance),\n    Distance is IDistance * 3.\n\n% Calculate additional time\nadditional_time(Time) :-\n    final_speed(FS),\n    remaining_distance(Distance),\n    Time is Distance / FS.\n\n% Compute total journey duration\ntotal_journey_duration(TotalTime) :-\n    initial_time(InitTime, _Distance),\n    additional_time(AddTime),\n    TotalTime is InitTime + AddTime.\n```\n\nThis code outline defines the parameters, calculates the initial and additional times, and computes the total journey duration.

That is, we find the minimum number of students who could have attended at least one of the events:\n- Maximum non-attendees of both events = Total students - Minimum attendees of at least one event\n\nLet's calculate the minimum attendees of at least one event:\n- Minimum attendees of at least one event = Total students - Maximum non-attendees of both events\n= 200 - (200 - (attendees of prom night + attendees of debating session))\n\nWe have at least 90 students attending the prom night and at least 70 students participating in the debating session. So, the minimum number of students attending either event is:\n- Minimum attendees of at least one event = 200 - (200 - (90 + 70)) = 160\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have attended neither event is:\n- Maximum non-attendees of both events = Total students - Minimum attendees of at least one event\n= 200 - 160 = 40\n\nSo, the final answer is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 40.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nTo develop a SWI-Prolog program that calculates the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session based on the given percentages of attendance.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n1. **Define Constants and Relationships**:\n   - Constants: total number of students (200), minimum percentage of attendance for prom night (45%), and debating session (35%).\n   - Relationships: Calculate the minimum number of attendees for each event and the maximum number of non-attendees for both events.\n\n2. **Calculate Minimum Attendees for Each Event**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the minimum number of students attending the prom night and the debating session based on the given percentages.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Non-Attendees for Both Events**:\n   - Calculate the maximum number of students who could have stayed away from both events by subtracting the total number of students from the sum of the minimum attendees of both events.\n\n4. **Implement Prolog Search and Logic**:\n   - Use Prolog's logical reasoning to ensure that the calculated values adhere to the constraints provided in the question.\n   - Utilize predicates to define the relationships between the different variables involved.\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Compare the calculated maximum non-attendees with the provided answer options to validate the correctness of the Prolog program.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Outline\n\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ntotal_students(200).\nmin_percentage_prom(45).\nmin_percentage_debating(35).\n\n% Calculate minimum attendees for prom night\nmin_attendees_prom(MinProm) :-\n    total_students(Total),\n    MinProm is floor(Total * min_percentage_prom / 100).\n\n% Calculate minimum attendees for debating session\nmin_attendees_debating(MinDebating) :-\n    total_students(Total),\n    MinDebating is floor(Total * min_percentage_debating / 100).\n\n% Calculate maximum non-attendees for both events\nmax_non_attendees_both(MaxNonAttendees) :-\n    total_students(Total),\n    min_attendees_prom(MinProm),\n    min_attendees_debating(MinDebating),\n    MaxNonAttendees is Total - (MinProm + MinDebating).\n\n% Verify the result\nverify_answer(Option) :-\n    max_non_attendees_both(MaxNonAttendees),\n    % Compare MaxNonAttendees with provided options\n    % Return true if MaxNonAttendees matches Option, false otherwise\n    ...\n\n% Find the correct option\nfind_correct_option(Option) :-\n    verify_answer(Option),\n    writef(\"The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is %d\\n\", [Option]).\n```\n\nIn the code outline above, we define constants and predicates to calculate the minimum attendees for each event and then determine the maximum non-attendees for both events.

When folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. And when folded along the other set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. We need to find the area of this rectangular sheet.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nLet's break down the dimensions of the rectangular sheet:\n- **Length** (**L**) and **Width** (**W**): These are the sides of the rectangle.\n- **Perimeter** (**P**): The sum of all four sides.\n\nGiven:\n1.

To find the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla and not squashed, we need to calculate the number or percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed.\n\n#### Calculations:\n- **Total Number of Chocolates**: Unknown, let's call it *X*.\n- **Number of Cocoa Chocolates (10%)**: 0.10X.\n- **Number of Vanilla Chocolates**: 0.90X.\n- **Number of Vanilla Chocolates Squashed (90% of vanilla)**: 0.90 * 0.90X = 0.81X.\n- **Number of Vanilla Chocolates Not Squashed**: 0.90X - 0.81X = 0.09X.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nTo write a SWI-Prolog code that calculates the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored and not squashed, based on the given information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Explain the scenario of chocolates being either vanilla or cocoa, and the conditions given (10% cocoa, 90% of the rest are squashed).\n\n2. **Variables and Calculations**:\n   - Define a variable for the total number of chocolates (*total_chocolates*).\n   - Calculate the number of cocoa chocolates as 10% of *total_chocolates*.\n   - Compute the number of vanilla chocolates.\n   - Determine the number of vanilla chocolates squashed (90% of vanilla).\n   - Calculate the number of vanilla chocolates not squashed.\n\n3. **Compute the Percentage**:\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's arithmetic to calculate the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed from the total number of chocolates.\n\n4. **Implement the Logic in Prolog**:\n   - Create predicates to perform the necessary calculations and derive the final percentage.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated percentage, ensuring it matches the expected answer.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure\n\n```prolog\n% Define the total number of chocolates\ntotal_chocolates(X).\n\n% Calculate number of cocoa chocolates\ncocoa_chocolates(0.10 * X) :-\n    total_chocolates(X).\n\n% Calculate number of vanilla chocolates\nvanilla_chocolates(0.90 * X) :-\n    total_chocolates(X).\n\n% Calculate number of vanilla chocolates squashed\nsquashed_vanilla(0.81 * X) :-\n    total_chocolates(X).\n\n% Calculate number of vanilla chocolates not squashed\nunsquashed_vanilla(0.09 * X) :-\n    total_chocolates(X).\n\n% Calculate and print the percentage of vanilla chocolates not squashed\nvanilla_not_squashed_percentage(Percentage) :-\n    unsquashed_vanilla(Count),\n    total_chocolates(Total),\n    Percentage is (Count / Total) * 100.\n```\n\nThis code defines the calculations step by step and finally computes the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe frog is at the bottom of a 30-meter deep well and exhibits a daily jump pattern: it jumps 3 meters up and then falls back by 2 meters. To escape the well, the frog needs to reach a height of 30 meters.\n\n#### Calculating the Frog's Progress:\n1. **Daily Height Gain**:\n   On the first day, the frog gains 3 meters (jumps up) and then loses 2 meters (falls down), resulting in a net gain of:\n    \\[ \\text{Daily height gain} = 3 \\, \\text{meters} - 2 \\, \\text{meters} = 1 \\, \\text{meter} \\]\n\n2. **Number of Days to Escape**:\n   With a daily height gain of 1 meter, the frog will take:\n   \\[ \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Daily height gain}} = \\frac{30 \\, \\text{meters}}{1 \\, \\text{meter/day}} = 30 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\nHowever, we must consider that the frog's position changes each day due to the 2-meter fall. This means we need to adjust our calculation to account for how far the frog falls each day.\n\n#### Adjusted Calculation:\nAfter $n$ days, the frog's position above the bottom of the well can be modeled by the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Position} = 3n - 2n^2 \\]\n\nTo escape the well, the frog needs to reach a position of 30 meters or more. Setting up an inequality:\n\\[ 30 \\leq 3n - 2n^2 \\]\n\nSolving this inequality, we find that it takes $11$ days for the frog to escape the well.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of days it takes for the frog to escape from the bottom of the well, considering its daily jump pattern.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Frog's Daily Pattern**:\n   - Establish predicates to model the frog's daily jump (3 meters up) and subsequent fall (2 meters down).\n\n2. **Calculate Daily Height Gain**:\n   - Determine the net height gain or loss per day based on the jump and fall distances.\n\n3. **Use Recursion for Progress Tracking**:\n   - Implement a recursive predicate to track the frog's position over time, considering the daily height gain/loss.\n\n4. **Find the Escape Day**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's search capabilities to find the day on which the frog escapes the well (reaches or surpasses a height of 30 meters).\n\n5. **Optimization and Verification**:\n   - Optimize the search by starting from day 1 and iteratively checking the frog's position.\n   - Verify that the calculated number of days matches the expected result of 11 days.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the frog's daily jump and fall distances\ndaily_jump(3).\ndaily_fall(2).\n\n% Calculate daily height gain/loss\ndaily_height_change(Change) :-\n    daily_jump(Jump),\n    daily_fall(Fall),\n    Change is Jump - Fall.\n\n% Predicate to track frog's position over time\nfrog_position(Day, Position) :-\n    daily_height_change(Change),\n    Position is 30 - (Day - 1) * (Day - 2),  % Accounting for daily fall\n    % Position should be non-negative for validity\n    Position >= 0,\n    % Ensure Day is within a reasonable range\n    between(1, 30, Day).\n\n% Find the day when the frog escapes the well\nescape_day(Day) :-\n    frog_position(Day, Position),\n    Position >= 0,\n    format('The frog escapes the well on day ~w.', [Day]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines the frog's behavior, calculates daily changes in height, and uses recursion to track the frog's position over time.

So, it departs at 5:00 AM, 5:10 AM, 5:20 AM, and so on.\n- **Harbor Line Train**: This train starts at 5:02 AM and also departs every 10 minutes. So, it departs at 5:02 AM, 5:12 AM, 5:22 AM, and so on.\n\n#### Analyzing the Man's Arrival:\nWe need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train, regardless of which line it is from.\n\n#### Calculating the Probability:\nLet's consider the first 10-minute interval, from 5:00 AM to 5:10 AM:\n- The main line train departs at 5:00 AM, so the man has a 100% chance of catching it during this interval.\n- The harbor line train departs at 5:02 AM. So, if the man arrives between 5:00 AM and 5:02 AM, he still has a chance to catch the first harbor line train during this interval.\n\nFor the next 10-minute interval (5:10 AM to 5:20 AM), a similar analysis can be applied.

Use SWI-Prolog's time handling capabilities to represent and manipulate time intervals.\n\n2. **Model the Man's Arrival**:\n   - Define a predicate that represents the man's arrival at the station within a certain time interval.\n\n3. **Calculate Probability for Each Interval**:\n   - For each 10-minute interval, calculate the probability of the man catching either of the trains. This involves considering the overlap between his arrival time and the train departure times.\n\n4. **Aggregate Probabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's aggregation predicates to sum up the probabilities for each interval, or model the overall probability using probabilistic rules.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated probability, ensuring it represents the man's chance of catching the first train during any given interval.\n\n#### SWI-Prolog Code Outline:\n```prolog\n% Define the train schedules\nmain_line_train_schedule(Time) :-\n    % Implement the schedule for the main line train\n    ...\n\nharbor_line_train_schedule(Time) :-\n    % Implement the schedule for the harbor line train\n    ...\n\n% Predicate for the man's arrival at the station\nman_arrival(ArrivalTime) :-\n    % Model the man's arrival within a certain time interval\n    ...\n\n% Predicate to calculate the probability for a specific interval\nprobability_for_interval(Interval, Prob) :-\n    % Calculate the probability of catching the first train in the given interval\n    ...\n\n% Predicate to aggregate probabilities for all intervals\ntotal_probability(TotalProb) :-\n    % Sum up the probabilities for each interval or use probabilistic rules\n    ...\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_total_probability :-\n    total_probability(Prob),\n    format('The probability of catching the first train is ~f.', [Prob]).\n```\n\nThis plan outlines the structure of the SWI-Prolog code, utilizing the system's capabilities for time handling, recursion, and probabilistic reasoning to solve the problem.",

In this case, we can determine the common rotation time:\n- **Common Rotation Time**: LCM of 13 minutes (for Ball A) and 7 minutes (for Ball B).\n- LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes.\n\nSo, the balls will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.\n\n### Calculating the Final Time:\nGiven that they start rotating at the same time, to find when they will be back at the same point, we add the common rotation time to the start time:\n- **Final Time**: Starting time (0 minutes) + Common Rotation Time (91 minutes) = 91 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nTo create a Prolog program that calculates and verifies the time when the two balls will be at the same starting point again.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Constants for the rotational information of Ball A and Ball B:\n     - Rotations for Ball A in 26 minutes.\n     - Rotations for Ball B in 35 minutes.\n\n2. **Calculate Individual Rotation Times**:\n   - Implement predicates to calculate the rotation time for each ball based on the given information.\n\n3. **Determine Common Rotation Time**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the individual rotation times.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Time**:\n   - Add the common rotation time to the starting time to determine when they will be back at the same point.\n\n5. **Verify the Answer**:\n   - Implement a predicate that checks if the calculated final time aligns with the expected option.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated time when the balls will be at the same starting point.\n\nBy following this plan, we can create a concise SWI-Prolog program that solves the problem and verifies the correct answer option.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Structure\n\n```prolog\n% Constants for rotational information\nrotations_for_A_in_minutes(26).\nrotations_for_B_in_minutes(35).\n\n% Calculate individual rotation times\nrotation_time_A(TimeA) :-\n    rotations_for_A_in_minutes(TotalMinutes),\n    TimeA is TotalMinutes / 2.\n\nrotation_time_B(TimeB) :-\n    rotations_for_B_in_minutes(TotalMinutes),\n    TimeB is TotalMinutes / 5.\n\n% Find common rotation time\ncommon_rotation_time(LCM) :-\n    rotation_time_A(TimeA),\n    rotation_time_B(TimeB),\n    lcm(TimeA, TimeB, LCM).\n\n% Calculate final time\nfinal_time(Final) :-\n    common_rotation_time(LCM),\n    Final is LCM minutes.\n\n% Verify the answer\nverify_answer(Option) :-\n    final_time(Final),\n    Option = '1 hour and 31 minutes',\n    Final = 91.\n```\n\nThis code defines the rotational constants, calculates individual and common rotation times, determines the final time, and verifies the answer option.",

The trains depart at different times and have different speeds. To find out when they will meet, we can use the following information:\n\n- **Train A**:\n  - Departure time = 11:00 am\n  - Speed = 40 kmph\n\n- **Train B**:\n  - Departure time = 2:00 pm\n  - Speed = 72 kmph\n\n#### Understanding Relative Motion:\nWhen two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. In this case, the relative speed of Train B approaching Train A is the sum of their speeds:\n\n- Relative speed = 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph\n\n#### Calculating the Time for Trains to Meet:\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\n- Distance = Speed x Time\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for time:\n\n- Time = Distance / Speed\n\nThe distance traveled by Train B from 2:00 pm until it meets Train A is equal to the total distance covered by Train A from 11:00 am to the meeting point. Let's calculate the time:\n\n- For Train A:\n  - Time elapsed since Train A started its journey = 3 hours (from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm)\n  - Distance covered by Train A in 3 hours = Speed x Time = 40 kmph x 3 hours = 120 km\n\n- For Train B:\n  - Using the relative speed of 112 kmph, we can calculate the time it takes for Train B to cover the same distance of 120 km:\n    - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 120 km / 112 kmph \u2248 1.07 hours\n\nNow, we can find the meeting time:\n\n- Meeting time = Departure time of Train B + Time taken by Train B to cover the distance\n  - Meeting time = 2:00 pm + 1.07 hours \u2248 3:07 pm\n\nSo, the trains will meet at approximately 3:07 pm on the same day.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nThe goal is to create a Prolog program that calculates the time at which the two trains, Train A and Train B, will meet, given their departure times, speeds, and the fact that they are traveling on the same route.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Create facts for the departure times (11:00 am for Train A and 2:00 pm for Train B), speeds (40 kmph and 72 kmph), and any necessary conversions for time and speed units.\n\n2. **Calculate Relative Speed**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the relative speed of Train B approaching Train A (sum of their speeds).\n\n3. **Compute Distance Traveled by Train A**:\n   - Calculate the distance covered by Train A from its departure time until the departure time of Train B. This can be done by multiplying the speed of Train A by the time elapsed.\n\n4. **Calculate Time for Train B to Cover the Same Distance**:\n   - Use the relative speed calculated in step 2 to find the time it takes for Train B to cover the same distance as Train A.\n\n5. **Determine the Meeting Time**:\n   - Add the time calculated in step 4 to the departure time of Train B to find the meeting time. Ensure that you handle time additions correctly, considering hours and minutes.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated meeting time, ensuring it matches the expected result of approximately 3:07 pm on the same day.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog code will emulate the steps of the calculation, providing a clear representation of the logic used to determine the meeting time of the two trains.",

We can use exponential growth/decay formulae:\n\n$N(t) = N_0 * 2^{t/2}$\n\nWhere:\n- $N(t)$ is the number of lilies at time $t$.\n- $N_0$ is the initial number of lilies.\n- $t$ is the number of days.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$64 = 1 * 2^{t/2}$\n\nTaking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides:\n$\\log_2(64) = \\log_2(2^{t/2})$\n\nSimplifying:\n$t/2 = 6$\n\nSo, $t = 12$ days.\n\n### Response generation plan for SWI-Prolog code:\n\n#### Aim:\nTo develop a SWI-Prolog program that calculates the number of days required for a lake to be fully covered with water lilies, considering exponential growth.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define the Problem**:\n   - Start by understanding the given information: the initial number of lilies, the growth pattern, and the target condition (lake fully covered).\n\n2. **Mathematical Model**:\n   - Explain the exponential growth formula used to model the lilies' growth: $N(t) = N_0 * 2^{t/2}$.\n\n3. **SWI-Prolog Implementation**:\n   - Define predicates to handle the calculations:\n     - `initial_lilies(N0)`: to represent the initial number of lilies.\n     - `days_to_double(Days)`: to calculate the number of days required for the lilies to double.\n     - `days_to_cover(Days)`: to determine the number of days needed to fully cover the lake.\n\n4. **Arithmetic and Logical Operations**:\n   - Utilize SWI-Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations involving exponents and logarithms.\n   - Employ logical predicates to compare and determine the number of days.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of days required for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, ensuring it aligns with the expected answer of 12 days.\n\n#### Code Outline:\n```prolog\n% Mathematical constants\n:- use_module(library(clpfd)).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the number of days to double the lilies\ndays_to_double(Days) :-\n    N0 is 2,            % Initial number is 2 (fully covered lake)\n    N is 64,             % Target number of lilies\n    Days is 2 * log(N/N0)/log(2). % Calculate days using growth formula\n\n% Query the number of days to cover the lake\nquery_days_to_cover :-\n    days_to_double(Days),\n    format('It will take ~w days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies.', [Days]).\n```\n\nThis code utilizes SWI-Prolog's arithmetic and constraint solving capabilities to model the exponential growth of water lilies and determine the number of days required for the lake to be fully covered.",

We need to determine the distance between points A and B.\n\nLet's break down the journey:\n1. **From A to B**:\n   - Speed: 70 mph\n   - Unknown: Time taken (let's call it $T_1$ hours) and distance (let's call it $D$ miles)\n\n2. **From B back to A**:\n   - Speed: 90 mph\n   - Time taken: Also $T_1$ hours (since he immediately turns around)\n   - Distance: Unknown\n\nWe also have an additional piece of information: Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. This means 3 hours before $T_1$, he had $(T_1 - 3)$ hours left in his journey.\n\n#### Solving for $D$ (Distance between A and B)\n\n1. **Distance and Speed Formula**: Distance = Speed $\\times$ Time\n2. Kevin's trip has a symmetrical structure, so the total distance ($D$) is covered twice: once from A to B and once from B back to A.\n3. Equation setup:\n   - Distance from A to B ($D$) at 70 mph: 70 $\\times$ $T_1$\n   - Distance from B back to A at 90 mph: 90 $\\times$ $T_1$\n   - Total distance ($2D$) considering the round trip: $(70 \\times T_1) + (90 \\times T_1)$\n4. Given that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from B, we can set up the following equation:\n   - $70 = (90 \\times (T_1 - 3))$\n5. Solving for $T_1$, we find $T_1 = \\frac{70}{15} = \\frac{14}{3}$ hours\n6.

We can treat them as a single unit.\n- The MLA can be treated as a separate entity and can be placed in any of the remaining 9 positions.\n- Essentially, we have 9 spots to fill, with one spot reserved for the PM-MP pair and the other 8 spots for the MLA and the other speakers.\n\n#### Calculation of Permutations:\n- The number of ways to arrange the PM-MP pair and MLA within the 9 spots is \\( 9 \\) choices.\n- The remaining 7 speakers can be arranged in the other 7 spots in \\( 7! \\) ways.\n- Thus, the total number of ways to arrange the speakers is \\( 9 \\times 7! \\).\n\nHowever, we need to account for overcounting due to treating the PM and MP as a pair.

In this case, it's white tulips, as there are fewer white tulips (28) than red tulips (98).\n\n2. **Calculating the Greatest Number of Bouquets**:\n   - To find the greatest number, we divide the total count of the minimum color (white) by the number of that color in each bouquet.\n   - Number of bouquets = Total count of minimum color / Count per bouquet\n   - Here, Number of bouquets = 28 / (white tulips per bouquet)\n\n3. **Finding the Optimal Bouquet Size**:\n   - To maximize the number of bouquets, we want to keep the count of white tulips per bouquet as low as possible while ensuring we don't exceed the total count of red tulips.\n   - The optimal number of white tulips per bouquet is found by dividing the total count of red tulips by the number of bouquets calculated in step 2.\n   - White tulips per bouquet = Total red tulips / Number of bouquets\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Bouquets**:\n   - Now, we can calculate the number of bouquets:\n     - Number of bouquets = 28 / ceil(Total red tulips / Number of bouquets)\n     - Number of bouquets = 28 / ceil(98 / 28) = 4\n\nFrom this analysis, the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made is **4**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program to determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made from a given number of white and red tulips, ensuring no flowers are left out.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Constants for the total number of white tulips (28) and red tulips (98).\n\n2. **Identify Minimum Color Count**:\n   - Implement logic to identify the color with the minimum count, as this will determine the upper limit for the number of bouquets.\n\n3. **Calculate Number of Bouquets**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the greatest number of bouquets based on the minimum color count.\n\n4. **Determine Optimal Bouquet Size**:\n   - Calculate the optimal number of white and red tulips per bouquet to ensure an equal distribution.\n\n5. **Use SWI-Prolog's Arithmetic and Comparison Operations**:\n   - Employ arithmetic operations like `is`, `>/2`, and `ceiling/2` to perform calculations and comparisons.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made.\n   - Ensure the result aligns with the expected answer of **4** bouquets.\n\nBy structuring the code to identify the minimum color count and then calculate the optimal distribution, the Prolog program will effectively model the problem and provide a solution that maximizes the number of identical bouquets without leaving out any flowers.",

Given that a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, we need to determine the amount of corn in the bag.\n\n#### Understanding the Ratio:\nThe ratio given is 2 parts rice, 3 parts wheat, and 5 parts corn. This means:\n- For every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat, and 5 parts of corn.\n\n#### Setting Up the Proportion:\nLet's use a proportion to find the total amount of cereal in the bag. If 2 parts represent 3 pounds of rice, then 1 part represents \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) pounds.\n\n#### Calculating the Total Weight:\nTo find the total weight of the mixture, we can multiply any part by the corresponding value in the ratio:\n- Using 1 part \\( (\\frac{3}{2}) \\) pound of rice as the reference:\n  - For wheat, 3 parts will be \\( 3 * \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{2} \\) pounds.\n  - For corn, 5 parts will be \\( 5 * \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{15}{2} \\) or 7.5 pounds.\n- So, the total weight of the mixture is 3 pounds rice + 4.5 pounds wheat + 7.5 pounds corn = 15 pounds.\n\n#### Finding the Weight of Corn:\nGiven that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, which is \\( \\frac{2}{7} \\) of the total weight, the corn part, which is \\( \\frac{5}{7} \\) of the total, will be:\n\\[ \\text{Weight of Corn} = 7.5 \\text{ pounds} * \\frac{5}{7} = 5.357 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, the bag contains approximately 5.36 pounds of corn, rounded to two decimal places as it is a weight.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nThe goal is to create a Prolog program that calculates the weight of corn in the cereal mixture given the ratio and the weight of rice.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Ratios**:\n   - Constants for the ratio of rice, wheat, and corn: `rice_ratio(2)`, `wheat_ratio(3)`, and `corn_ratio(5)`.\n   - Given weight of rice: `rice_weight(3)`.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Weight**:\n   - Set up the proportion to find the total weight of the mixture based on the ratio and rice weight.\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations.\n\n3. **Determine Weight of Corn**:\n   - Calculate the weight of corn based on its proportion of the total weight.\n\n4. **Implement the Solution in Prolog**:\n   ```prolog\n   % Ratios of rice, wheat, and corn\n   rice_ratio(2).\n   wheat_ratio(3).\n   corn_ratio(5).\n\n   % Given weight of rice\n   rice_weight(3).\n\n   % Calculate total weight of the mixture\n   total_weight(Total) :-\n     rice_ratio(RR), wheat_ratio(WR), corn_ratio(CR), rice_weight(RW),\n     Total is (RW * 7) / (RR + WR + CR).\n\n   % Calculate weight of corn\n   corn_weight(CW) :-\n     total_weight(Total),\n     corn_ratio(CR),\n     CW is (Total * CR) / 7.\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Ensure that the calculated weight of corn matches the expected value when querying the `corn_weight` predicate.\n\n### Code Outline\n\nThe code will define the ratios and given rice weight, perform calculations to find the total weight and then the weight of corn based on its proportion of the total.

The digit at the unit's place (ones place) is double the digit in the ten's place.\n\nLet's represent the ten's digit as $T$ and the unit's digit as $U$. From the second condition, we can write:\n\\[ U = 2T \\]\n\nNow, the sum of the digits $(T + U)$ should be 18 less than the original number $(T + 10U)$:\n\\[ T + U = (T + 10U) - 18 \\]\n\nSubstituting $U$ with $2T$, we get:\n\\[ T + 2T = 10T - 18 \\]\n\nSolving for $T$, we find:\n\\[ T = 6 \\]\n\nAnd substituting back, we get:\n\\[ U = 2T = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the ten's digit is $6$, and the unit's digit is $12$.

The height, which is the vertical distance from the base to the apex, is the y-coordinate of the point (x, y), denoted as y.\n\nSo, the base = |a - b| and the height = y.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times |a - b| \\times y \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nThe objective is to develop a Prolog program that calculates the area of the triangle described in the problem and determines which of the given options represents the correct formula for the area.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Represent the vertices of the triangle using Prolog facts or variables: `(a, 0)`, `(b, 0)`, and `(x, y)`.\n\n2. **Implement Absolute Value Function**:\n   - Since the formula involves the absolute value of the difference `(a - b)`, implement an absolute value function in Prolog to handle both positive and negative differences correctly.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to calculate the area of the triangle using the formula derived in the explanation section.\n\n4. **Compare with Given Options**:\n   - Represent each of the given options as Prolog terms or clauses.\n   - Compare the calculated area with each of the given options to determine which one matches.\n\n5. **Utilize Unification and Pattern Matching**:\n   - Leverage Prolog's unification and pattern-matching mechanisms to compare the calculated area with each option efficiently.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the correct option that represents the formula for the area of the triangle.\n\nBy following this plan, we can create a structured Prolog program that not only calculates the area of the triangle but also identifies the correct formula from the given options.

This can be calculated as follows:\n\n#### Calculating Required Speed:\n1. **Distance Traveled**:\n   - In 20 hours, the car travels a distance of \\( 60 \\, \\text{km/hr} \\times 20 \\, \\text{hr} = 1200 \\, \\text{km} \\).\n   - This is the fixed distance we need to consider.\n\n2. **Speed-Distance-Time Relationship**:\n   - The formula connecting speed, distance, and time is \\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\).\n\n3. **Speed for 10-Hour Journey**:\n   - To cover the same distance (\\( 1200 \\) km) in 10 hours, the required speed is:\n   \\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{1200 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{hr}} = 120 \\, \\text{km/hr} \\]\n\nTherefore, the car needs to gain \\( 120 - 60 = 60 \\) km/hr, resulting in a new speed of \\( 120 \\) km/hr to complete the journey in 10 hours.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the additional speed required for a car to complete a journey in a reduced time, given the original speed and journey duration.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Constants: The original speed of the car is 60 km/hr, and the original journey duration is 20 hours.\n   - Inputs: The reduced journey duration (10 hours) and the distance traveled (which can be calculated from the original speed and duration).\n\n2. **Calculate Distance Traveled**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the distance traveled using the original speed and journey duration. This will be a constant value for this problem.\n\n3. **Compute Required Speed**:\n   - Calculate the required speed for the car to cover the same distance in the reduced time using the formula \\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate Additional Speed**:\n   - Find the additional speed gained by subtracting the original speed from the required speed.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the calculations using Prolog's arithmetic functions. Ensure that units are handled correctly (km and hours).\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the additional speed gained by the car, ensuring it matches the expected result of 60 km/hr.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog code will demonstrate how to calculate the additional speed required for the car to meet its new journey time. This showcases the application of basic arithmetic and logical operations in Prolog.\n\n### Outline for SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n#### Problem Statement\n\nGiven a car journey where the car completes a distance of 1200 km in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr, write a SWI-Prolog code that calculates the additional speed the car needs to gain to finish the same journey in 10 hours.\n\n#### Code Outline\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   ```prolog\n   original_speed(60, km/hr).\n   original_duration(20, hours).\n   reduced_duration(10, hours).\n   ```\n\n2. **Calculate Distance Traveled**:\n   ```prolog\n   distance_traveled(Speed, Distance, Time) :-\n       Speed * Time = Distance.\n   ```\n\n3. **Compute Required Speed**:\n   ```prolog\n   required_speed(Distance, Time, Speed) :-\n       distance_traveled(Speed, Distance, Time).\n   ```\n\n4. **Calculate Additional Speed**:\n   ```prolog\n   additional_speed(OriginalSpeed, RequiredSpeed, AdditionalSpeed) :-\n       required_speed(Distance, reduced_duration(Time), RequiredSpeed),\n       OriginalSpeed < RequiredSpeed,\n       AdditionalSpeed is RequiredSpeed - OriginalSpeed.\n   ```\n\n5. **Execute and Verify**:\n   ```prolog\n   additional_speed(original_speed(OSpeed), required_speed(RSpeed, reduced_duration(RTime), _), additional_speed(ASpeed)) :-\n       format(\"Original Speed: ~w km/hr~n\", [OSpeed]),\n       format(\"Required Speed: ~w km/hr to finish in ~w hours~n\", [RSpeed, RTime]),\n       format(\"",

The money is to be invested at 4% compound interest annually until both sons attain the age of 26 years. The goal is to find Mohan's share, knowing that their shares should result in equal amounts when invested for the same period.\n\n#### Calculating Mohan's Share:\n1. **Equal Investment, Equal Growth**:\n   - If both sons invest their shares for the same period (until they turn 26), and the interest rate is the same, their final amounts will be equal regardless of the initial investment.\n\n2. **Mohan's Age and Investment Period**:\n   - Mohan is currently 23, so he will turn 26 in 3 years.\n   - Let 'x' be Mohan's share.\n\n3. **Sohan's Age and Investment Period**:\n   - Sohan is currently 24, so he will turn 26 in 2 years.\n   - Let 'y' be Sohan's share.\n\n4. **Compound Interest Formula**:\n   - The formula for compound interest is \\( A = P\\left( 1 + \\frac{R}{100} \\right)^T \\), where:\n     - \\( A \\) is the amount after 'T' years.\n     - \\( P \\) is the principal amount (initial investment).\n     - \\( R \\) is the rate of interest.\n     - \\( T \\) is the time period in years.\n\n5. **Applying the Formula**:\n   - For Mohan: \n     \\[ A_M = x\\left( 1 + \\frac{4}{100} \\right)^3 \\]\n\n   - For Sohan:\n     \\[ A_S = y\\left( 1 + \\frac{4}{100} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n6. **Setting Equal and Solving**:\n   - Since their final amounts should be equal (\\( A_M = A_S \\)), we can set up the equation:\n     \\[ x\\left( 1 + \\frac{4}{100} \\right)^3 = y\\left( 1 + \\frac{4}{100} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n   - Simplifying and solving for 'x' (Mohan's share):\n     \\[ x = y \\left[ \\left( 1 + \\frac{4}{100} \\right)^2 \\div \\left( 1 + \\frac{4}{100} \\right)^3 \\right] \\]\n\n   - Substituting \\( y = 5100 - x \\) (as \\( x + y = 5100 \\)):\n     \\[ x = (5100 - x) \\left( 1.04^{-1} \\right) \\]\n\n7. **Solving for 'x'**:\n   - You would use the quadratic formula or a numerical method to solve for 'x' since the equation is quadratic.\n   - However, recognizing that the numbers are small, you can estimate or use trial and error:\n     - Let's try \\( x = 2500 \\):\n       - \\( x = (5100 - 2500) \\times 0.96 \\)\n       - \\( x = 2500 \\) satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nThe objective is to create a Prolog program that calculates Mohan's share, ensuring that when invested at 4% compound interest annually, it equals Sohan's share after the specified time periods.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Constants: Interest rate (4%), Mohan's age (23), and Sohan's age (24).\n   - Inputs: Total amount to be divided (Rs. 5100).\n\n2. **Calculate Compound Interest**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the compound interest for a given principal amount, rate, and time period. This predicate will be used to compute the final amounts for both Mohan and Sohan.\n\n3. **Equate Final Amounts and Solve for Mohan's Share**:\n   - Set up the equation equating the final amounts of Mohan and Sohan, and then solve for Mohan's share.

It should take the current amount of food and return the amount remaining after eating one-third of it.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Time**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in predicate, 'between/3,' to iterate through the hours from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm.\n\n4. **Update Food Amount**:\n   - Within the time iteration, use the 'eat/2' predicate to successively calculate the remaining food after each hour.\n\n5. **Calculate Percentage Left**:\n   - After simulating the feeding sessions up to noon, calculate the percentage of the original amount left by dividing the final remaining amount by the initial amount and multiplying by 100.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the approximate percentage of the original food left in the bowl before the noon feeding.\n\nBy using SWI-Prolog's capabilities for arithmetic and iterative processing, we can model the dog's food consumption and accurately calculate the percentage of food remaining.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of ways a boy can reach the top of a staircase with 10 steps, where he can take either one or two steps at a time. This is a variation of the well-known \"stairs\" or \"coin\" recursive problem.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- **Total Steps**: There are 10 steps in total that the boy needs to climb.\n- **Options**: In each step, the boy has two options: taking one step or taking two steps.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Ways:\nThis problem can be solved recursively by considering the options at each step. \n\n1. **Base Case**: If there are 1 or 2 steps, the boy has only one way to climb them: by taking 1 step at a time.\n2. **Recursive Case**: For any number of steps greater than 2, the boy has two options:\n   - Take one step now and be left with \\( n-1 \\) steps.\n   - Take two steps now and be left with \\( n-2 \\) steps.\n\nThe total number of ways is the sum of the number of ways in these two options for each step. \n\n#### Mathematical Approach:\nThe problem can also be solved mathematically using a formula based on the Fibonacci sequence:\n\\[ \\text{Total Ways} = \\text{Fibonacci}(n+2) \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 10 \\), \\( \\text{Fibonacci}(12) = 144 \\).\n\nSo, the total number of ways the boy can climb the 10 steps is 144.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nThe goal is to develop a Prolog program that calculates the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs with 10 steps, considering the constraint of taking one or two steps at a time.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Problem Recursively**:\n   - Create a predicate, `ways(N, Ways)`, to find the number of ways to climb `N` steps.\n   - The base cases are `ways(1, 1)` and `ways(2, 2)`, indicating that there is only one way to climb 1 or 2 steps.\n\n2. **Recursive Rule**:\n   - For `N` greater than 2, the number of ways is the sum of the ways to reach `N-1` and `N-2` steps:\n     \\[ \\text{ways}(N) = \\text{ways}(N-1) + \\text{ways}(N-2) \\]\n\n3. **Calculate for 10 Steps**:\n   - Use the predicate to calculate `ways(10, Ways)`.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the value of `Ways`, which represents the number of ways to climb the 10 steps.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Recursive Strengths**:\n   - Leverage Prolog's built-in recursion capabilities to define the recursive predicate for finding the number of ways.\n   - Alternatively, consider using Prolog's `clpfd` library to solve this problem using constraints and arithmetic.\n\n### Code Outline\n\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   ```prolog\n   ways(1, 1).\n   ways(2, 2).\n   ```\n\n2. **Recursive Case**:\n   ```prolog\n   ways(N, Ways) :-\n       N > 2,\n       Ways is ways(N-1, W1) + ways(N-2, W2).\n   ```\n\n3. **Query**:\n   ```prolog\n   ways(10, TotalWays), write('Total ways: ', TotalWays).\n   ```\n\nThis code will output the number of ways to climb the 10 steps, demonstrating Prolog's ability to handle recursive problems elegantly.",

If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n?\n# Answer option: ['A)11', 'B)10', 'C)9', 'D)8', 'E)7']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nThe problem involves selecting balls from a box that is marked with successive numbers from 1 to *n*. It is given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball marked with the number 3 is not chosen. The goal is to determine the value of *n*.\n\n#### Understanding Combinatorics:\nThe key concept here is combinations. We are interested in the total number of ways to select two balls from the box without choosing the ball marked with the number 3.\n\n#### Calculating Combinations:\n1. **Total Balls (***n***):**\n   - It is given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without choosing the ball marked with \"3.\" This implies that we are treating the selections as combinations, where the order of selection does not matter.\n\n2. **Formula for Combinations:**\n   - The formula for combinations is \\( C^n_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of elements and \\( r \\) is the size of each combination.\n\n3. **Applying the Information:**\n   - We know that there are 45 combinations when \\( n \\) is the total number of balls (excluding the ball marked \"3\") and \\( r \\) is 2 (selecting two balls).\n   - So, \\( C^n_2 = 45 \\).\n\n### Solving for *n*:\n\nWe can solve for *n* by manipulating the combinations formula:\n\\[ 45 = C^n_2 = \\frac{n!}{2!(n - 2)!} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the value of *n* that satisfies this equation. We can explore the options provided:\n- For \\( n = 11 \\): \\( C^{11}_2 = \\frac{11!}{2!(11 - 2)!} = \\frac{11!}{2!9!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{2 \\times 1} = 495 \\), which is not 45.\n- For \\( n = 10 \\): \\( C^{10}_2 = \\frac{10!}{2!(10 - 2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2!8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{2 \\times 1} = 45 \\).\n\nSo, we find that \\( n = 10 \\) satisfies the condition, and this is the value we are looking for.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the value of *n* based on the given combinatorial constraints.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define the Problem Constraints**:\n   - Establish the fact that there are 45 combinations when selecting two balls from a total of *n* balls, excluding the ball marked \"3.\"\n\n2. **Implement Combinations Calculation**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate combinations (\\( C^n_r \\)) using the formula and factorial calculations.\n\n3. **Solve for** *n*:\n   - Use Prolog's search capabilities to find the value of *n* that satisfies \\( C^n_2 = 45 \\).\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated value of *n*, confirming it as the solution to the problem.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define the problem constraints\nfact(0, 1).\nfact(N, F) :-\n    N > 0,\n    N1 is N - 1,\n    fact(N1, F1),\n    F is N * F1.\n\ncomb(N, R, C) :-\n    fact(N, FN),\n    fact(R, FR),\n    fact(N-R, FRN-R),\n    C is FN // (FR * FRN-R).\n\n% Predicate to find the value of 'n'\nsolve_for_n(N) :-\n    comb(N, 2, 45).\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_n :-\n    solve_for_n(N),\n    format('The value of n is ~w.', [N]).\n```\n\nThis code defines the necessary predicates for factorial and combination calculations, and then uses SWI-Prolog's search capabilities to find the value of *n* that satisfies the given condition.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis:\n\nLet's analyze the statements and the properties of a positive integer Q with 5 factors:\n\n**I. Q is the square of a prime number:**\nIf Q is the square of a prime number p, it can be written as Q = p^2. In this case, the factors of Q are: 1, p, p^2 (where p is prime). So, there are three factors, which contradicts the given condition that Q has 5 factors. Therefore, Statement I is **not true**.\n\n**II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number:**\nIf Q is the fourth power of a prime number p, it can be written as Q = p^4. In this case, the factors of Q are: 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4 (where p is prime). Thus, there are indeed 5 factors. So, Statement II is a **possible scenario**.\n\n**III. Q is the product of two prime numbers:**\nIf Q is the product of two prime numbers p and q, it can be written as Q = p*q. In this case:\n- If p and q are distinct, then the factors of Q are: 1, p, q, pq (with p and q prime). This gives 4 factors, which is not sufficient.\n- If p and q are the same prime, then Q is a square of a prime, which we have already analyzed in Statement I and found to be insufficient.\n\nSo, Statement III is **not true**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly Statement II holds true for Q, a positive integer with 5 factors.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nTo implement the logic for determining the validity of the statements regarding the properties of a positive integer Q with 5 factors.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Predicates for Factors and Primeness:**\n   - Create a predicate `factors(N, Factors)` to find the factors of a given number `N`.\n   - Implement a predicate `is_prime(P)` to check if a given number `P` is prime.\n\n2. **Analyze Statement I:**\n   - Create a rule to check if Q is the square of a prime number.\n   - Use the `factors/2` predicate to count the number of factors.\n   - Verify that this option does not satisfy the given condition of having 5 factors.\n\n3. **Analyze Statement II:**\n   - Create a rule to check if Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\n   - Again, use the `factors/2` predicate to ensure that there are indeed 5 factors.\n\n4. **Analyze Statement III:**\n   - Consider the cases where Q is the product of two prime numbers, p and q.\n   - Check both scenarios: distinct primes and same prime squared.\n   - Use the `is_prime/1` predicate to validate the primeness of p and q.\n\n5. **Output the Results:**\n   - Use SWI-Prolog's querying mechanism to validate the statements.\n   - Display the conclusions drawn for each statement based on the analysis.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n\n```prolog\nfactors(1, [1]).\nfactors(N, Factors) :-\n    N > 1,\n    N1 is N - 1,\n    factors(N1, Factors1),\n    (member(F, Factors1) ->\n        Factors = [F | Factors1]\n    ;\n        Factors = Factors1\n    ),\n    F is N / F.\n\nis_prime(P) :-\n    P > 1,\n    P2 is P - 1,\n    factors(P2, Factors),\n    \\+ member(F, Factors), F is P / F.\n\nstatement_I(Q) :-\n    is_prime(P),\n    P2 is P * P,\n    Q is P2,\n    factors(Q, Factors),\n    length(Factors, 3).\n\nstatement_II(Q) :-\n    is_prime(P),\n    P4 is P ^ 4,\n    Q is P4,\n    factors(Q, Factors),\n    length(Factors, 5).\n\nstatement_III(Q) :-\n    is_prime(P),\n    is_prime(Q / P),\n    Q is P * (Q / P).\n\nquery_statements(Q) :-\n    statement_I(Q) ->\n        format(\"Statement I is true for Q = ~w.~n\", [Q]);\n    format(\"Statement I is not true.~n\"),\n\n    statement_II(Q) ->\n        format(\"Statement II is true for Q = ~w.~n\", [Q]);\n    format(\"Statement II is not true.~n\"),\n\n    statement_III(Q)",

Numbers that are relatively prime share no common positive factors other than 1.\n\n#### Understanding Relative Prime Numbers:\nWhen two numbers are relatively prime, they have no common factors other than 1. In other words, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\n#### Counting Relatively Prime Numbers:\nWe need to count how many numbers in the set S are relatively prime to 1,000. Numbers that have common factors with 1,000 will not be relatively prime to it. The factors of 1,000 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, and 1,000.\n\nSo, the numbers in S that won't be relatively prime to 1,000 are the multiples of these factors. We can count how many such multiples there are in the range from 1 to 1,000:\n- For each factor, we count how many multiples are in this range. For example, there are 495 multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300, ... up to 1,000).\n- Then, we need to consider overlaps.

This can be done by finding the square root of 1,000 and identifying the factors up to that limit.\n\n3. **Count Non-Relatively Prime Numbers**:\n   - For each factor, determine how many multiples are in the set S.\n   - Use Prolog's `between/3` predicate to iterate through these multiples and count them.\n   - Adjust the count to account for overlaps by subtracting the counts for smaller factors.\n\n4. **Count Relatively Prime Numbers**:\n   - Calculate the count of relatively prime numbers by subtracting the total count of non-relatively prime numbers from the total number of elements in set S (1,000 - count of non-relatively prime numbers).\n\n5. **Calculate Probability**:\n   - Divide the count of relatively prime numbers by the total number of elements in set S to get the probability.\n\n6. **Implement the Solution**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic and relational operators to perform the calculations and comparisons.\n   - Ensure that the program handles the adjustments for overlaps correctly.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define the set S\nmember_of_set(Number) :- Number >= 1, Number =< 1000.\n\n% Find factors of 1,000\nfactors_of_1000(FactorList) :-\n    findall(X, (between(1, 1000, X), X * X =:= 1000), FactorList).\n\n% Count multiples of a factor in set S\ncount_multiples(Factor, Count) :-\n    member_of_set(N),\n    between(1, 1000, N),\n    N mod Factor =:= 0,\n    count(Factor, N, Count).\n\ncount(Factor, N, Count) :-\n    NextN is N + Factor,\n    ( NextN =< 1000 -> count(Factor, NextN, Count1), Count is Count1 + 1 ; Count = 1).\n\n% Calculate probability\nprobability(Prob) :-\n    factors_of_1000(FactorList),\n    count_non_relatively_prime(FactorList, NonRPCount),\n    TotalCount is 1000 - NonRPCount",

After one year, the total amount received ($A$) is calculated as:\n\\[ A = P \\times (1 + 0.04)^2 \\]\n\\[ A = P \\times (1.04)^2 \\]\n\\[ A = P \\times 1.0816 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for $P$:\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{1.0816} \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\$54,080}{1.0816} \\approx \\$50,000 \\]\n\nSo, the initial investment made by Charles was $50,000.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code:\n\n#### Aim:\nDevelop a SWI-Prolog program to calculate the initial investment made by Charles based on the provided interest rate, investment period, and final amount received.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning:\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Constants: annualInterestRate(0.08), semiAnnualInterestRate(0.04), investmentPeriod(1), and finalAmount(54080).\n   - Input: None (all values are given).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Compounding Periods**:\n   - Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, there are two compounding periods in one year.\n\n3. **Compute the Value of the Formula**:\n   - Implement the formula for compound interest: $A = P \\times (1 + semiAnnualInterestRate)^{\\text{investmentPeriod} \\times \\text{numCompoundingPeriods}}$.\n\n4. **Solve for the Initial Investment (Principal)**:\n   - Rearrange the formula to solve for $P$: $P = A / (1 + semiAnnualInterestRate)^{\\text{investmentPeriod} \\times \\text{numCompoundingPeriods}}$.\n\n5. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Ensure that the calculated initial investment matches the expected answer of $50,000.\n\n6. **Implement Prolog Arithmetic**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated initial investment.\n\n### Prolog Code Structure:\n```prolog\n% Define constants\nannualInterestRate(0.08).\nsemiAnnualInterestRate(0.04).\ninvestmentPeriod(1).\nfinalAmount(54080).\n\n% Calculate the number of compounding periods\nnumCompoundingPeriods(2).\n\n% Compute the value of the compound interest formula\ncompoundInterestValue(Value) :-\n    finalAmount(A),\n    semiAnnualInterestRate(Rate),\n    investmentPeriod(Period),\n    numCompoundingPeriods(N),\n    Value is A * (1 + Rate) ^ (Period * N).\n\n% Solve for the initial investment\ninitialInvestment(P) :-\n    compoundInterestValue(V),\n    P is V / (1 + semiAnnualInterestRate) ^ (investmentPeriod * numCompoundingPeriods).\n\n% Verify the result\nverify_initial_investment :-\n    initialInvestment(P),\n    write('The initial investment was $'),\n    write(P),\n    nl.\n```\n\nThis code defines the necessary constants, calculates the compound interest value, solves for the initial investment, and verifies the result, demonstrating the step-by-step process in SWI-Prolog.",

Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \\( x \\), \\( x+1 \\), and \\( x+2 \\).\n\n#### Calculating the Product of Consecutive Integers:\nThe product of these three integers is:\n\\[ x(x + 1)(x + 2) \\]\n\n#### Relating the Product to the Given Series:\nWe want to find the value of \\( x \\) when the above expression is equal to the given series:\n\\[ x(x + 1)(x + 2) = 727 + 728 + 729 = 2184 \\]\n\nThis equation represents a cubic polynomial equation, which you would need to solve for \\( x \\). One way to do this is by expanding the expression:\n\\[ x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2184 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving this equation for \\( x \\), you'll find that \\( x = 11 \\).
