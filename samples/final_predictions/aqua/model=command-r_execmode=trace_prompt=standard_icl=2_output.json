This step involves listing all permutations and then counting them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Implement efficient search through the space of all permutations of the provided letters.\n   - Use the `findall` predicate to gather all permutations and the `length` predicate to count them, ensuring we get the factorial number as calculated analytically.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of permutations, verifying that it matches \\( 7! = 5040 \\).\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling lists and permutations efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem.

The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(\u221a3 + 1)', 'B)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)', 'C)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)', 'D)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)', 'E)None of these']",

We need to determine how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nTo solve this, we can use trigonometry and analyze the angles and speeds involved.\n\n#### Analyzing the Situation:\n- The tower's height is being measured vertically, and we have information about the angle of elevation from the car's perspective.\n- When the angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, we can assume that the car has moved closer to the tower, and the angle between the car's path and the tower's height has decreased.\n\n#### Relating Angle and Time:\n- Let's assume the speed of the car is constant and the tower is infinitely tall.\n- The change in angle of elevation over time gives us a ratio: (change in angle)/time = angle/time when close to the tower.\n- For the initial 45\u00b0 angle, time is 10 minutes. We'll use this ratio to find the time required for the angle to increase to 90\u00b0, which corresponds to the car reaching the base of the tower.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate the time required for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation increases from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Specify the initial angle (45\u00b0) and the angle when the car reaches the base (90\u00b0).\n   - Set the time for the transition from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 degrees as 10 minutes.\n\n2. **Trigonometric Calculations**:\n   - Use Prolog's mathematical capabilities to compute trigonometric functions.\n   - Calculate the ratios of angular change over time for both the initial and final angles.\n\n3. **Determine Time**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic to divide the initial time by the ratio obtained in step 2 to find the total time required.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the additional time required for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's mathematical capabilities and logical reasoning, we can solve this trigonometry problem efficiently.

To achieve this, we can leverage the properties of these divisors. \n\n#### Properties of 9 and 12:\n- Both 9 and 12 are divisors of 36.\n- Numbers divisible by 9 have a sum of digits that is also divisible by 9.\n- Numbers divisible by 12 are also divisible by 3, and the sum of their digits is divisible by 3.\n\n#### Strategy:\nWe can iterate through the options and check which one satisfies the conditions of being divisible by both 9 and 12.

We have information about the minimum attendance for both events.\n\n#### Breaking Down the Problem:\nLet's define the total number of students who attended the prom night and the debating session as follows:\n- \\( P \\) represents the number of students who attended the prom night only.\n- \\( D \\) represents the number of students who attended the debating session only.\n- \\( O \\) represents the number of students who attended neither event (the group we're trying to find the maximum size for).\n\nWe also know the following:\n- The minimum attendance for the prom night is 45% of the total student population (200 students), i.e., \\( P + O \\geq 90 \\).\n- The minimum attendance for the debating session is 35%, which means \\( D + O \\geq 70 \\).\n\n#### Finding the Maximum Size of Group O:\nWe can set up and solve a system of equations based on the above information. Since we're looking for the maximum size of group O, we'll maximize \\( O \\) in the equations.\n\n1. **Equation for Prom Night**: \\( P + O \\geq 90 \\)\n\n2. **Equation for Debating Session**: \\( D + O \\geq 70 \\)\n\n3. **Maximize \\( O \\)**: We'll assume \\( O \\) is the largest value in both equations, so \\( O \\geq \\min(90 - P, 70 - D) \\).\n\nAdditionally, the total number of students must be considered: \\( P + D + O = 200 \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to find the maximum number of students who did not attend either event.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set the constant `total_students` to represent the total number of students (200).\n\n2. **Define the Predicates**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the conditions for prom night attendance (`min_prom_attendees`) and debating session attendance (`min_debate_attendees`).\n\n3. **Write the Goal**:\n   - Formulate the goal to find the maximum value of \\( O \\) (the number of students who attended neither event) while satisfying the attendance constraints.\n\n4. **Solve the Constraints**:\n   - Use Prolog's constraint solving capabilities to solve the system of equations formed by the attendance constraints and the total student count.\n\n5. **Extract and Output the Result**:\n   - Retrieve the maximum value of \\( O \\) from the solution, which represents the desired answer.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants\ntotal_students(200).\n\n% Attendance constraints\nmin_prom_attendees(90).\nmin_debate_attendees(70).\n\n% Goal: Find the maximum number of students who attended neither event\nmax_unattended_students(O) :-\n    min_prom_attendees(P_min),\n    min_debate_attendees(D_min),\n    O >= P_min,\n    O >= D_min,\n    total_students(Total),\n    P + D + O = Total,\n    Total = 200,\n    % Solve the constraints to find the maximum O\n    constraint_solving(O).\n```\n\nBy setting up the problem in terms of the attendance constraints and using Prolog's constraint solving, we can efficiently find the maximum number of students who attended neither the prom night nor the debating session.",

We can calculate this markup as \\( \\text{Markup} = 0.40 \\times \\text{CP} \\).\n\n3. **Selling Price**:\n   - The selling price is obtained by adding the markup to the cost price:\n   \\[ \\text{Selling Price} = \\text{CP} + \\text{Markup} = \\text{CP} + 0.40 \\times \\text{CP} = 1.40 \\times \\text{CP} \\]\n\nNow, we also know that the selling price, along with the markup, results in a $20 gross profit:\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price} + \\text{Cost Price} = 20.00 + \\text{Selling Price} \\]\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price} = 50.00 \\]\n\nHence, the retailer sold the appliance for $50.00, which corresponds to answer option 'B'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the selling price based on the given problem constraints.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Cost Price**:\n   - Introduce a variable, say `cp`, to represent the cost price of the appliance.\n\n2. **Calculate the Markup**:\n   - Write a predicate to compute the markup amount using the fact that it's 40% of the cost price:\n   \\[ \\text{markup} = 0.40 \\times \\text{cp} \\]\n\n3. **Find the Selling Price**:\n   - Another predicate can be defined to calculate the selling price by adding the markup to the cost price:\n   \\[ \\text{selling\\_price} = 1.40 \\times \\text{cp} \\]\n\n4. **Check the Gross Profit**:\n   - Ensure that the selling price, along with the cost price, results in a $20 gross profit.

We need to identify the pair that does not satisfy this routine.\n\nFor a pair to satisfy the routine, it should adhere to both conditions: the first condition is that `x` should be between 0 and 100, and the second condition is that `y` should be less than or equal to the square root of `x`.\n\n### Eliminating Options\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- **(99, 10)**: The square root of 99 is approximately 9.95. Since 10 is less than 9.95, this pair satisfies the routine.\n- **(85, 9)**: The square root of 85 is closer to 9.21.

Hose A worked alone for the first 2 hours, and then both hoses worked together to finish filling the pool in an additional 3 hours. We need to determine how long it would take hose B to fill the pool by itself.\n\n#### Amount of Water Filled by Hose A in 2 Hours:\nHose A fills a certain amount of water \\( W \\) in 2 hours. This means that the rate of filling by hose A is \\( \\frac{W}{2} \\) units of water per hour.\n\n#### Amount of Water Filled by Both Hoses in 3 Hours:\nIn the next 3 hours, both hoses fill the remaining water, which is also \\( W \\).\n\n#### Hose B's Filling Rate:\nSince hose B was working alongside hose A in the last 3 hours, we can determine hose B's filling rate by subtracting hose A's 3-hour contribution from the total filled amount. This will give us the amount of water filled by hose B in 3 hours. Then, we can calculate its filling rate by dividing this amount by 3.\n\n#### Calculating Time for Hose B to Fill the Pool:\nNow that we know hose B's filling rate, we can find the time required for it to fill the entire pool by itself.

We can break down the number's characteristics step by step.\n\n1. **Starting with a 1**: If we start with the digit '1' in the original number, adding a '1' after the number would double its value. For instance, 1xx1x would become 1xx2x.\n\n2. **Doubling the Number**: Since doubling the number gives us half of the required result (as it goes from 5 to 6 digits), we can infer that the original number's digit sum is odd. This is because doubling an odd number yields an even number.\n\n3. **Tripling the Number**: Now, considering that tripling the number makes it three times as large as the original, we aim to find a 5-digit number whose triple is 6 digits long. This implies that the triple of our number is formed by adding two digits (since 5+2=7) to its beginning.\n\n4. **Identifying the Number**: The number's characteristics narrow down our search.

We'll subtract this percentage from the total to find the required percentage.\n\n### Mathematical Approach:\n1. **Overlap**: 24% of students are in both groups.\n\n2. **Non-Overlap**: 20% of the remaining 76% (non-chess club members) are on the swim team. This equates to 15.2% of the total student population.\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: To find the total percentage of swim team members, we add the overlap percentage and the non-overlap percentage. So, \\( 24\\% + 15.2\\% = 39.2\\% \\) of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team, considering the given conditions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Initialize the total percentage of students who are in both the chess club and swim team as `Overlap`, and the percentage of swim team members not in the chess club as `NonOverlap`.\n\n2. **Calculate Non-Overlap**:\n   - Subtract `Overlap` from the total 100% to find the percentage of students not in the chess club.\n   - Multiply this percentage by `NonOverlap` to get the percentage of non-chess club students who are swim team members.\n\n3. **Add Overlap**:\n   - Add the percentage from step 2 to the `Overlap` percentage to obtain the final percentage of students who are swim team members.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates for multiplication and addition to perform the calculations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated percentage of students who are members of the swim team.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants for clarity\nconstant(overlap, 24).\nconstant(non_overlap, 20).\n\n% Calculate the percentage of students who are members of the swim team\nswim_team_members(Result) :-\n    NonClubMembers is 100 - overlap,\n    NonClubSwimmers is non_overlap * NonClubMembers / 100,\n    FinalResult is overlap + NonClubSwimmers,\n    Result is FinalResult / 100.  % Convert to percentage\n```\n\nThis Prolog code follows the mathematical breakdown and efficiently computes the required percentage, demonstrating Prolog's utility in handling such logical problems.",

We can approach this problem by considering the consecutive increases in population over time.\n\n#### Current Population:\n- The current population of the city is 78,000.\n\n#### Annual Growth:\n- The population increases by 5% every year. This means that, in one year, the change in population is 5% of the current population.\n\n#### Calculation Steps:\n1. **First Year**: After the first year, the population will be 78,000 + 5% of 78,000.\n\n2. **Second Year**: In the second year, the 5% increase is calculated based on the new population after the first year. So, we need to find the population after the first year and then apply another 5% increase in the second year.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the population of the city after a 5% annual increase for two consecutive years, starting from a given current population.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Represent the current population as a fact in Prolog.\n\n2. **Annual Increase Calculation**:\n   - Define a predicate that represents the annual increase by applying a 5% growth rate.\n\n3. **Consecutive Increases**:\n   - Use Prolog's recursive capabilities to apply the annual increase predicate twice, representing the two consecutive years.\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Population**:\n   - After applying the increases for each year, calculate the final population.\n\n5. **Compare with Answer Options**:\n   - Use Prolog's comparison operators to determine and output the correct answer from the given options.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the current population\ncurrent_population(78000).\n\n% Annual increase predicate\nannual_increase(Population, IncreasedPop) :-\n    NewPop is Population + (Population * 0.05),\n    IncreasedPop is NewPop - Population.\n\n% Apply annual increases consecutively\ntwo_years_later(IncreasedPop) :-\n    annual_increase(current_population, YearOnePop),\n    annual_increase(YearOnePop, IncreasedPop).\n\n% Calculate and output the final population\nfinal_population(FinalPop) :-\n    two_years_later(FinalPop),\n    write(FinalPop).\n```\n\nProlog's recursive nature will be instrumental in solving this problem, as we apply the annual increase twice consecutively.

We need to determine the smallest number of letters required for her to create unique codes for all 10 books.\n\n#### Strategies for Coding Books:\n1. **Single Letter**: Amy can use a single letter to code a book, which means she needs 10 different letters.\n2. **Pair of Letters**: Amy could also use pairs of letters (ignoring order), which offers more coding options. The number of pairs of different letters that can be chosen from the English alphabet is \\( \\binom{26}{2} \\).\n\n#### Determining the Minimum Letters Required:\nTo represent 10 book types, Amy needs:\n- 10 letters for single-letter coding.\n- Or, a smaller number of letters might suffice for pair-letter coding.\n\nWe should compare these two options to find the smallest number.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to determine the smallest number of letters Amy needs for uniquely coding her books using either single or paired letters.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Number of Book Types**:\n   - Set a constant for the number of books/book types Amy has, which is 10.\n\n2. **Calculate Single Letter Coding**:\n   - Calculate the number of letters required for single-letter coding using a simple counting predicate.\n\n3. **Calculate Paired Letter Coding**:\n   - Compute the number of combinations of 2 letters that can be chosen from the English alphabet, using Prolog's built-in combination functions.\n\n4. **Determine Minimum Letters**:\n   - Compare the results from single-letter and paired-letter coding to find the smaller value.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Present the smallest number of letters Amy needs for unique book coding.\n\nBy implementing these steps in Prolog, we can logically deduce the minimum number of letters required and verify the correct answer. Prolog's combination functions will be instrumental in calculating the paired-letter coding possibilities.",

To achieve this, he needs to increase the discounted prices by a certain percentage. Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\nThe discounted price of an item is 80% of its original price, as a 20% discount is equivalent to keeping 80% of the original amount. To return to the original prices, we must increase the 80% value back to 100%. \n\n#### Calculating the Required Percentage Increase\n\n1. Increasing from 80% to 100% means we need to add 20% of the discounted price.\n2. \\( \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{20\\%}{80\\%} = \\frac{1}{4} = 25\\% \\)\n\nTherefore, the shopkeeper needs to increase the prices by 25% to return them to their original values.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate and verify the required percentage increase to return the prices to their originals after a 20% discount.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Discount**: Declare a constant for the discount percentage, which is 20% (or 0.2 in decimal form).\n\n2. **Calculate Required Increase**: \n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to compute the required increase based on the logic outlined above.

Therefore:\n\\[ \\text{Plane Distance} = X \\]\n\nSetting these equal, we find:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\frac{X}{\\text{Ship Speed}} = X \\]\nSolving for `X`, we get:\n\\[ X = \\frac{\\text{Ship Speed} \\times 9}{10} = \\frac{180 \\times 9}{10} = 1620 / 10 = 162 \\]\nmiles.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to compute the distance traveled by the ship when it meets the plane, starting from the same point.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set the constant `ship_speed` to represent the speed of the ship (180 miles/time unit).\n\n2. **Calculate Meeting Distance**:\n   - Use a mathematical goal in Prolog to solve for `X` in the equation \\( 10 \\times \\frac{X}{\\text{ShipSpeed}} = X \\).\n\n3. **Display the Result**:\n   - Display the value of the meeting distance, which is \\( 162 \\) miles.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants\nship_speed(180). % Ship speed in miles per time unit\n\n% Compute the meeting distance\nmeeting_distance(X) :-\n    ship_speed(S),\n    X is S * 9 / 10. % Solve the equation 10 * X/S = X\n\n% Display the result\nsolve :-\n    meeting_distance(X),\n    write(X), write(' miles').\n```\n\nThis Prolog code efficiently computes and displays the distance at which the ship and plane meet using the provided constants and mathematical relationships.",

The relevant details are as follows:\n\n- The point is positioned 10 centimeters away from the fan's center.\n- The fan operates at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute.\n- Our objective is to determine the distance covered by this point during a 30-second interval.\n\n#### Understanding the Distance Formula\n\n1. **Circular Path**: The point in question traverses a circular path, with a radius of 10 centimeters.\n2. **Distance Formula**: The distance \\( D \\) traveled along a circle of radius \\( r \\) during \\( n \\) revolutions is given by: \\( D = 2\\pi r \\cdot n \\).\n\n#### Calculating Distance Traveled\n\n1. **Radius**: The radius of the circular path is provided as 10 centimeters.\n2. **Revolutions**: The fan completes 300 revolutions in one minute, thus in half a minute (30 seconds), it would complete:\n   \\[ \\frac{300 \\text{ revolutions/minute} \\times 30 \\text{ seconds}}{60 \\text{ seconds/minute}} = \\frac{150}{2} \\text{ revolutions} = 75 \\text{ revolutions} \\]\n\n3. **Applying the Distance Formula**: Using the distance formula mentioned earlier, the distance traveled is:\n   \\[ D = 2\\pi \\cdot 10\\text{ cm} \\cdot 75 \\text{ revolutions} = 1500\\pi \\text{ cm} \\]\n\n### Plan for SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Objective\nCreate a Prolog program to compute the distance traveled by a point on a rotating fan blade, based on the given radius, rotational speed, and time duration.\n\n#### Procedure and Justification\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define facts in Prolog for the radius, rotational speed (in rpm), and time duration (in seconds).\n\n2. **Circumference Computation**:\n   - Write a Prolog predicate to calculate the circumference of the circular path using the formula \\( 2\\pi r \\).\n   - Name this predicate `calculate_circumference/2`, where the first argument is the radius and the second is the circumference.\n\n3. **Revolution Calculation**:\n   - Compute the number of revolutions the fan makes in the given time.\n   - Create a predicate `revolutions_in_time/3`, taking the rotational speed (rpm), time in seconds, and the number of revolutions as arguments.\n   - Convert the time from seconds to minutes as part of the calculation.\n\n4. **Distance Calculation**:\n   - Multiply the number of revolutions by the circumference to find the total distance.\n   - Implement a predicate `total_distance/3`, taking the circumference, number of revolutions, and total distance as arguments.\n\n5. **Utilize Prolog's Arithmetic Functions**:\n   - Make use of Prolog's arithmetic capabilities, such as the `is` function and arithmetic operators, within the predicates to perform the calculations.\n\n6. **Obtain and Present the Result**:\n   - Call the appropriate predicates in a manner that yields the final result.\n   - Format and display the result, ensuring it matches the expected value of \\( 1500\\pi \\) centimeters.\n\n#### Sample Prolog Code\n```prolog\n% Constants\nradius(10).                  % Radius of the circular path (in cm)\nrotational_speed(300).       % Revolutions per minute\ntime_duration(30).           % Time duration in seconds\n\n% Calculate circumference\ncalculate_circumference(Radius, Circumference) :-\n    Circumference is 2 * 3.14159 * Radius.  % Using the formula: Circumference = 2*pi*r\n\n% Calculate revolutions in the given time\nrevolutions_in_time(RPM, Time, Revolutions) :-\n    Minutes is Time / 60,  % Convert time from seconds to minutes\n    Revolutions is RPM * Minutes / 2.\n\n% Calculate total distance traveled\ntotal_distance(Circumference, Revolutions, Distance) :-\n    Distance is Circumference * Revolutions.\n\n% Compute and display the result\nmain :-\n    radius(R),\n    calculate_circumference(R, C),\n    revolutions_in_time(rotational_speed(RPM), time_duration(Time), Revs),\n    total_distance(C, Revs, Dist),\n    write(Dist).\n```\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that the Prolog code tackles each aspect of the problem systematically, leading to a clear and accurate solution.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nTo determine when C joined the business, we should first analyze the available information and identify the key steps to solve the problem.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- A starts a business with Rs. 40,000.\n- B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000.\n- At some later point, C joins with Rs. 120,000.\n- C's share of the profit is Rs. 150,000.\n- The total profit after one year is Rs. 375,000.\n\n#### Breaking Down the Investment Timeline:\nWe need to determine the number of months after B joined that C entered the business. This means we should identify the timeline of investments and correlate them with the given data.\n\n1. **A's Initial Investment**:\n   - A starts the business with Rs. 40,000. This is the base investment, and no time is specified for this step.\n\n2. **B's Investment**:\n   - After 2 months, B joins and invests Rs. 60,000. This occurs at month 2.\n\n3. **C's Investment**:\n   - C joins at some unknown point later and invests Rs. 120,000.\n\n#### Calculating C's Join Timeline:\nTo find out when C joined, we should consider the total profit and the shares received by each partner.\n\n1. **Profit Distribution**:\n   - C receives Rs. 150,000 as his share, which is half of his investment:\n   \\[ \\text{C's Share} = \\frac{120000}{2} = Rs. 60,000 \\]\n   This implies that the total profit after C joins is twice the amount he receives as a share:\n   \\[ \\text{Total Profit After C Joins} = 2 \\times Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 300,000 \\]\n\n2. **Calculating Timeline**:\n   - The timeline for C's join can be determined by considering the remaining profit after B's investment.\n   - At the time of B's investment, the total money invested is:\n   \\[ \\text{Total Investment} = Rs. 40,000 + Rs. 60,000 = Rs. 100,000 \\]\n   - The remaining profit after B's investment would be the total profit minus the profit corresponding to B's investment:\n   \\[ \\text{Profit After B} = Rs. 375,000 - \\left( \\frac{Rs. 60,000}{Rs. 100,000} \\times Rs. 300,000 \\right) = Rs. 187,500 \\]\n   - Since the profit after C joins is Rs. 300,000, and this occurs some time after B's investment, we can find the number of months using the remaining profit and the profit per month.\n   - Assuming the profit is evenly distributed across the months, the profit per month is:\n   \\[ \\text{Profit/Month} = Rs. 187,500 / (\\text{Number of Months After B Joins}) \\]\n   - We can then find the number of months required for the remaining profit to reach Rs. 300,000.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of months it took for C to join the business after B's investment, given the financial details provided.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Facts**:\n   - Define the initial investment amounts for A, B, and C, as well as the total profit and C's share.\n\n2. **Calculate Profit After B**:\n   - Compute the profit remaining after B's investment using the total profit and B's share.\n\n3. **Determine Profit Per Month**:\n   - Assuming an even distribution of profit across months, calculate the profit accrued per month from the profit remaining after B's investment.\n\n4. **Calculate Number of Months for C**:\n   - Use a predicate to iterate through months, starting from the second month (after B's investment), and accumulate the profit.\n   - Identify the first month where the accumulated profit exceeds the profit after C joins.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of months required for C to join the business.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define investment and profit facts\ninitial_investment_A(40000).\ninvestment_B(60000, 2).",

At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?\n# Answer option: ['A)80', 'B)120', 'C)240', 'D)320', 'E)360']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem describes a store's sales of yellow and white golf balls throughout the day. Our objective is to find out how many yellow golf balls the store had in stock at the beginning of the day.\n\nWe can deduce that:\n1. The store started with a total of 600 golf balls, which included both yellow and white balls.\n2. 80% of the total inventory was sold, meaning 20% remained unsold.\n3. The number of white and yellow balls sold was equal, which means that half of the sold balls were white, and half were yellow.\n4. All the white balls were sold, which implies that the number of white balls sold is half of the 80% of the total inventory.\n\n#### Calculations:\n1. **Total Golf Balls Sold**:\n   80% of 600 golf balls: \\( 0.8 \\times 600 = 480 \\) balls.\n\n2. **Number of White Balls Sold**:\n   Half of the total balls sold: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 480 = 240 \\) balls.\n\n3. **Number of Yellow Balls Sold**:\n   Equal to the number of white balls sold: \\( 240 \\) balls.\n\n4. **Yellow Balls Remaining**:\n   Since the store had an equal number of yellow and white balls at the beginning, the number of yellow balls remaining after sales is the same as the number of white balls remaining. Therefore, 20% of the initial inventory is left, which is: \\( 0.2 \\times 600 = 120 \\) yellow balls.\n\nTo find the initial number of yellow balls, we add the sold and remaining yellow balls: \\( 240 + 120 = 360 \\).\n\nThe correct answer is thus option 'E': The store started the day with **360 yellow golf balls**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to deduce and output the number of yellow golf balls the store had in stock at the beginning of the day based on the given information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasonation\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Represent the total initial inventory as `total_balls` and the percentage sold as `sold_percentage`.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sold Balls**:\n   - Compute the number of balls sold using the given percentage.\n\n3. **Determine White Balls Sold**:\n   - Find half of the total sold balls to determine the number of white balls sold.\n\n4. **Find Initial Yellow Balls**:\n   - As the number of yellow and white balls was equal at the beginning, the difference between the initial inventory and white balls sold gives the number of yellow balls.\n\n5. **Add Sold Yellow Balls**:\n   - Add the number of yellow balls sold (equal to the number of white balls sold) to the initial yellow balls to find the total yellow balls.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to find initial yellow balls\ninitial_yellow_balls(TotalBalls, SoldPercentage, Result) :-\n    TotalSold is TotalBalls * SoldPercentage / 100,\n    WhiteSold is TotalSold / 2,\n    InitialYellow is TotalBalls - WhiteSold,\n    SoldYellow is WhiteSold,\n    Result is InitialYellow + SoldYellow.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses basic arithmetic operations and logical deductions to solve the problem, showcasing Prolog's ability to handle real-world scenarios.",

        "question": "Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nHow many times did the coin landed on Heads ?\n# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)23', 'C)16', 'D)18', 'E)12']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem revolves around a coin flip game between Christopher and Jonathan. After 20 coin flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan ended up winning or losing any money, which means their earnings balanced each other out. We need to determine the number of times the coin landed on heads.\n\nTo achieve a balance, we can analyze the number of times the coin must have landed on heads, considering the unique situation of the game.\n\n#### Analysis\n\n1. **Coin Flip Consequences**: Each time the coin shows heads, Christopher pays Jonathan $2. Tails, on the other hand, results in Jonathan paying Christopher $3.\n\n2. **Break-Even Point**: For the game to end in a tie, the difference in earnings between Christopher and Jonathan must cancel out. That is, \\( 2x - 3y = 0 \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of heads and \\( y \\) is the number of tails.\n\n#### Determining the Solution\n\n1. **Equation Solution**: Solving for \\( x \\) in the equation above, we find that \\( x = 3y \\).\n\n2. **Constraints**: Since the total number of flips is 20, and each flip is either heads or tails, \\( x + y = 20 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for Heads**: Substituting \\( y = 20 - x \\) into \\( x = 3y \\), we get \\( x = 3(20 - x) \\), which simplifies to \\( 4x = 60 \\). Solving further, we find \\( x = 15 \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the coin must have landed on heads exactly **15 times**.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate the number of times the coin landed on heads given the described coin flip game.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Game Scenario**:\n   - Create a predicate to represent the coin flip game, with variables for the number of heads and tails.\n\n2. **Implement the Logic**:\n   - Write a predicate that finds solutions to the equation \\( 2x - 3y = 0 \\) using Prolog's arithmetic and logic capabilities.\n\n3. **Enforce Constraints**:\n   - Ensure that the sum of heads and tails equals the total number of flips (20).\n\n4. **Find the Solution**:\n   - Use Prolog's search capabilities to find the value of heads (\\( x \\)) that satisfies the equation and the constraint.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of times the coin landed on heads (the value of \\( x \\)).\n\nBy constructing a predicate that models the game and solving the relevant equation, we can use Prolog's search and logic capabilities to determine the number of heads required for a break-even scenario.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe task involves deciphering a multiplication table with four columns and three rows. Each cell of the table contains a single letter. The correct sequence of numbers will be formed by reading the columns of the table.\n\n#### Understanding the Table:\n- The table has three rows and four columns.\n- Each cell contains a single letter.\n\n#### Extracting Numerical Values:\n1. **Interpreting the Cells**: Each cell's letter corresponds to a number. For instance, 'A' could represent the number 1, 'B' could be 2, and so on.\n\n2. **Building the Number Sequence**: The numbers in each column should multiply to form the correct sequence, as indicated by the title \"Multiplication Table.\"\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to decipher the multiplication table by interpreting the letters as numbers and finding the correct sequence.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Table**:\n   - Represent the multiplication table as a list of lists in Prolog. Each inner list corresponds to a row, and the elements within these lists are the letters from the table.\n\n2. **Define the Number-Letter Mapping**:\n   - Create a mapping between letters and numbers. For example, 'A' could be mapped to 1, 'B' to 2, and so on. This can be defined as a list of number-letter pairs.\n\n3. **Extract Numerical Values**:\n   - Write a predicate that takes a letter and returns its corresponding number, using the mapping defined earlier.\n\n4. **Calculate the Product**:\n   - For each column, compute the product of the numerical values of the letters using Prolog's arithmetic capabilities.\n\n5. **Assemble the Sequence**:\n   - Combine the products obtained in each column to form the correct sequence of numbers.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the sequence of numbers by concatenating them together.\n\nBy defining the multiplication table and number-letter mapping clearly, the Prolog code will be able to interpret the table accurately and provide the correct sequence of numbers as the output. This approach leverages Prolog's strength in working with lists and performing arithmetic computations.",

If the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, how many options does he have to allocate his meals?\n# Answer option: ['A)5C3*4C3', 'B)5C4*4C2', 'C)5C2*4C4', 'D)5C6*4C5', 'E)4C3*4C3']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nFernando's meal plan allows him to have 3 lunches and 3 dinners during the week (Monday to Thursday, since the cafeteria is closed on weekends). He also goes home for dinner on Fridays. We need to find the number of ways he can allocate his remaining meals for lunch and dinner on the other days.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Choose the days for 3 lunches.\n- Choose the days for 2 dinners (Monday to Thursday, as Friday is fixed).\n\n#### Calculating Options:\n1. **Choosing Lunch Days**:\n   - There are 4 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday) on which Fernando can have lunch.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 of these days is given by the combination \\( {4 \\choose 3} \\).\n\n2. **Choosing Dinner Days**:\n   - With the lunch days chosen, Fernando can then choose 2 days from the remaining 3 days (Tuesday to Thursday) for dinners.\n   - This is equivalent to selecting 2 days out of 4, which is \\( {4 \\choose 2} \\).\n\nThe total number of options for Fernando to allocate his meals is then given by \\( {4 \\choose 3} \\times {4 \\choose 2} \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of options for Fernando's meal allocation, given his constraints.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Constants**:\n   - Define the constants for the number of lunch and dinner options available to Fernando during the week.\n\n2. **Calculate Lunch Options**:\n   - Use Prolog's combination predicates or custom code to compute \\( {4 \\choose 3} \\), which represents the number of ways to choose 3 days for lunches.\n\n3. **Calculate Dinner Options**:\n   - Given that one dinner is fixed (Friday), we need to choose 2 days from the remaining 4 for the other dinners. Calculate \\( {4 \\choose 2} \\).\n\n4. **Combine Options**:\n   - Multiply the number of lunch options by the number of dinner options to obtain the final count.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Mathematical Functions**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's mathematical predicates or built-in functions to compute the combinations efficiently.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated number of options, ensuring it matches the answer choice \\( {4 \\choose 3} \\times {4 \\choose 2} \\).\n\nBy breaking down the problem into choosing lunch days and dinner days, we can use Prolog's mathematical predicates to efficiently compute the combinations and arrive at the solution.

        "question": "A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount?\n# Answer option: ['A)247.67', 'B)237.67', 'C)227.67', 'D)215.67', 'E)None of these']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat with a stated price of $20,000 and a discount if paid within 30 days (4/30, n/100). To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within the 30 days, which means he needs to have the money ready by then. This situation raises the question of how much money the merchant needs to borrow to take advantage of the discount, and what the highest interest rate would be for him to afford the full amount in time.\n\n#### Understanding the Invoice Terms:\n- **4/30**: This indicates that a 4% discount will be granted if the invoice is paid within 30 days.\n- **n/100**: This means the full amount is due if not paid within the discount period.\n\n#### Borrowing Calculation:\nTo calculate the highest interest rate, we need to determine the amount of money the merchant needs to borrow.\n\n1. **Discounted Price**: The merchant gets a 4% discount, so the discounted price is:\n   \\[ \\text{Discounted Price} = 96\\% \\times \\$20,000 = \\$19,200 \\]\n\n2. **Amount to Borrow**: The merchant already has \\$8,000, so he needs to borrow the difference:\n   \\[ \\text{Amount to Borrow} = \\$20,000 - \\$19,200 = \\$800 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the highest interest rate that would make this borrowing affordable within the 30-day period.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate the highest interest rate that would make the borrowing of \\$800 feasible for the merchant to take advantage of the discount.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set the discounted price (\\$19,200) and the amount to borrow (\\$800) as constants in Prolog.\n\n2. **Interest Rate Calculation**:\n   - Initialize a variable for the interest rate (e.g., `Rate`).\n   - Calculate the full amount after the interest has accrued over 30 days.\n   - Ensure that this calculated amount matches the original invoice amount of \\$20,000.\n\n3. **Find the Highest Rate**:\n   - Start with a very high initial rate and gradually decrease it until the borrowing becomes affordable.\n   - Use a loop that iteratively reduces the interest rate until the borrowed amount, with the accrued interest, reaches or exceeds the needed amount.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Looping Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates for calculations and its looping constructs to iteratively adjust the interest rate.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the highest interest rate that allows the merchant to borrow the required amount.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Constants\nDiscountedPrice = 19200.0.\nAmountToBorrow = 800.0.\nDays = 30.\n\n% Variable for interest rate\ninterest_rate(Rate) :-\n    FullAmount is DiscountedPrice + AmountToBorrow * (1 + Rate/100)**Days,\n    FullAmount >= 20000.\n\nhighest_rate :-\n    Rate1 is 10000/100, % Initial high rate\n    Rate2 is 0.01,    % Minimum rate (1% or 0.01 as 1/100)\n    loop(Rate1).\n\nloop(Rate) :-\n    interest_rate(Rate),\n    NextRate is Rate - 0.1,  % Decrease rate by 0.1%,\n    loop(NextRate);\n    write(Rate).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code employs loops and arithmetic operations to find the highest interest rate that enables the merchant to borrow the necessary amount, showcasing Prolog's flexibility in handling real-world financial scenarios.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nTo determine the time Shweta takes to cover 100 km on her bike, we need to consider her riding rate, the rest stops she makes, and how these factors influence the overall journey.\n\n#### Riding Rate and Rest Stops:\n- Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour.\n- She takes a 10-minute rest after every 15 km traveled.\n\n#### Breaking Down the Journey:\n1. **Initial Riding Phase**:\n   - For the initial phase, Shweta rides 15 km without a rest. This takes her 1.5 hours because 15 km / 10 km/hr = 1.5 hours.\n\n2. **Rest Stop**:\n   - After 15 km, she takes a 10-minute rest. We need to convert this to hours, which is 10/60 = 0.1667 hours.\n\n3. **Subsequent Riding Phases**:\n   - Following the rest, Shweta resumes riding. We need to calculate the time taken to complete the remaining 85 km.\n   - For this, we can calculate the number of rest stops required for 85 km: 85 \u00f7 15 = 5.6667 (or 6 rest stops, as we round up).\n   - Each riding phase after the rest is 15 km and takes 1.5 hours.\n\n4. **Total Time**:\n   - The total time is the sum of the initial riding phase, the rest stop time, and the subsequent riding phases: \\( 1.5 \\text{ hr} + 0.1667 \\text{ hr} \\times 6 \\) = 11 hours.\n\nFrom this analysis, Shweta will take 11 hours to cover 100 km.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that simulates Shweta's journey of 100 km on her bike, accounting for her riding rate and rest stops.\n\n#### Steps and Reasonation\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Set the riding rate (distance per hour) and the rest time as constants in Prolog.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Riding Phase**:\n   - Write a predicate to compute the distance covered in the initial riding phase before the first rest.\n   - This distance is 15 km, and the time taken is derived from the riding rate: 15 km / 10 km/hr.\n\n3. **Rest Stop Adjustment**:\n   - Create a predicate to account for the rest time after the initial riding phase.\n   - Convert the rest time in minutes to hours.\n\n4. **Determine Subsequent Riding Phases**:\n   - Calculate the number of rest stops required for the remaining journey of 85 km.\n   - Each subsequent riding phase covers 15 km and takes the same time as the initial phase.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Time**:\n   - Sum up the time taken for the initial phase, rest stops, and subsequent riding phases.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total time required for Shweta to cover 100 km, ensuring it matches our analytically computed value of 11 hours.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog code will logically break down Shweta's journey, making it readable and allowing for a straightforward implementation of the problem's solution.",

We can approach this by calculating how much food is consumed in the first three hourly intervals and then finding the percentage of the remaining food.\n\n#### Food Consumption per Hour:\nThe dog consumes 1/3 of the remaining food each hour. This means, in three hours (from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM), it would have consumed 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1 of the food.\n\n#### Remaining Food Percentage:\nAfter the first three hours, 1 part of the original food would have been consumed, leaving 2 parts remaining.

Q is the fourth power of a prime number**: Q being the fourth power of a prime number doesn't guarantee 5 factors.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem revolves around finding the probability of choosing a number from the set S such that it is relatively prime to 1000. Numbers that are relatively prime to 1000 share no common factors with 1000 except for 1. \n\n#### Factors of 1000\nTo find the number of relatively prime numbers, we first need to determine the factors of 1000.\n\n1000 can be factorized as \\( 1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\n#### Counting Relatively Prime Numbers\nNext, we count the numbers from 1 to 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000. Any number \\( x \\) that is relatively prime to 1000 must have the form:\n\\[ x = 1000k + y \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is any integer, and \\( y \\) is any number that is coprime to 1000 (has no common factors with 1000). \n\nThe choices for \\( y \\) are more limited than those for \\( x \\) due to the common factors they must avoid. Specifically:\n- \\( y \\) cannot end in a 0, since 1000 ends in 00.\n- \\( y \\) cannot be divisible by 2, because 1000 is divisible by 2^3.\n- \\( y \\) cannot be divisible by 5, as 1000 is divisible by 5^2.\n- \\( y \\) also cannot share any other prime factors with 1000 (since they must be relatively prime). \n\nThe only restrictions on \\( y \\) are that it ends with a non-zero digit and is not divisible by 2 or 5. There are 900 numbers between 1 and 1000 that satisfy this condition.\n\n#### Total Number of Numbers in S\nThe set S contains integers from 1 to 1000 inclusive, giving us a total of 1000 numbers.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate the probability of choosing a number from set S that is relatively prime to 1,000 by counting the number of suitable numbers.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Range**:\n   - Set up the range of numbers from 1 to 1000 as this is the set S mentioned in the problem.\n\n2. **Count Relatively Prime Numbers**:\n   - Write a predicate to check if a number is relatively prime to 1000. This involves checking if the number doesn't share any common factors with 1000 apart from 1.\n   - Use the factorization of 1000 to aid in this check.\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability**:\n   - Divide the count of relatively prime numbers by the total size of set S to get the probability.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Searching and Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's efficient searching and arithmetic predicates to traverse the numbers and perform calculations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated probability.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Constants and Setup\nmax_number(1000).\n\n% Predicate to check if a number is relatively prime to 1000\nis_rel_prime(X) :-\n    % Check for factor of 2\n    X mod 2 =/= 0,\n    % Check for factor of 5\n    X mod 5 =/= 0,\n    % Check for other prime factors\n    X mod 10 =/= 0, X mod 50 =/= 0, X mod 100 =/= 0, X mod 250 =/= 0, X mod 500 =/= 0.\n\n% Predicate to calculate the probability\nrel_prime_probability(Prob) :-\n    % Count the relatively prime numbers\n    count_rel_prime(Count),\n    % Calculate the probability\n    Prob is Count / max_number.\n\n% Predicate to count the relatively prime numbers\ncount_rel_prime(Count) :-\n    max_number(Max),\n    count_rel_prime_helper(1, Max, 0),\n    %. aggregate goal: once(is_rel_prime(X)) will run is_rel_prime(X) once for each X=1..1000\n    aggregate(once, is_rel_prime(X), Count).\n\ncount_rel_prime_helper(X, Max, Count) :-\n    X =< Max,\n    (   is_rel_prime(",

When P and Q eat together, they collectively consume the candies at a faster rate than either of them alone.\n2.
