Therefore, the brother's age is half of the person's age when the person was 2 years old. Since the person is 60 years old, the brother's age is half of 2, which is 1 year old.\n\nFrom this analysis, the brother's age is 1 year old.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the age of the brother when the person is 60 years old, given that the brother was half the age of the person when the person was 2 years old.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create a list representing the person's age and the brother's age.\n\n2. **Age Calculation**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in arithmetic predicates to calculate the age of the person and the brother.\n\n3. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the age of the brother, verifying that it matches 1 year old.\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling arithmetic operations efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem.

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe task is to determine the number of ways to travel from place M to place Q by taking buses.\n\n#### Analyzing the Bus Routes:\n- There are 3 buses from M to N, 4 buses from N to O, 1 bus from O to P, and 3 buses from P to Q.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Ways:\n1. **Number of Routes**: Since there are 3 buses from M to N, 4 buses from N to O, 1 bus from O to P, and 3 buses from P to Q, the total number of routes is \\( 3 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 36 \\).\n\n2. **Calculation of Routes**: The number of routes from M to Q is given by the product of the number of buses on each route. For the given bus routes:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 36 \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the number of distinct routes from M to Q is 36.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of routes for the given bus routes.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create a list representing the number of buses on each route.\n\n2. **Route Calculation**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in multiplication predicate or define a custom one to calculate the product of the list of buses.\n\n3. **Counting Routes**:\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s aggregation predicates to count the number of unique routes generated from the original list. This step involves listing all routes and then counting them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Implement efficient search through the space of all routes.\n   - Use the `findall` predicate to gather all routes and the `length` predicate to count them, ensuring we get the product of the number of buses on each route.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of routes, verifying that it matches \\( 3 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 36 \\).\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling lists and multiplication efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem.

The speeds are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr.\n\n#### Analyzing the Problem:\n- **Square**: The airplane is flying along the four sides of a square.\n- **Speeds**: The airplane is flying at different speeds along each side of the square.\n- **Average Speed**: The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n\n#### Calculating the Average Speed:\n1. **Distance Traveled**: The distance traveled by the airplane is the sum of the distances traveled along each side of the square.\n   - Distance traveled = \\( 200 + 400 + 600 + 800 = 2000 \\) km.\n\n2. **Time Taken**: The time taken by the airplane is the sum of the times taken to travel along each side of the square.\n   - Time taken = \\( 200/200 + 400/400 + 600/600 + 800/800 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Average Speed**: The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.\n   - Average speed = \\( 2000/8 = 250 \\) km/hr.\n\nFrom this analysis, the average speed of the airplane around the field is 250 km/hr.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the average speed of an airplane flying along the four sides of a square at different speeds.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total distance traveled (2000 km) and the total time taken (8 hours).\n\n2. **Calculate Average Speed**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.\n\n3. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the division of distances and times.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the calculation of distances and times.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the average speed of the airplane around the field.\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and calculate the average speed of the airplane. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in handling combinatorial",

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the probability of a man catching the first train that arrives at the station. The trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, and the main line train starts at 5 am, while the harbor line train starts at 5.02 am.\n\n#### Analyzing the Trains:\n- **Main Line Train**:\n  - Frequency: 10 minutes\n  - Start Time: 5 am\n- **Harbor Line Train**:\n  - Frequency: 10 minutes\n  - Start Time: 5.02 am\n\n#### Calculating the Probability:\nThe probability of catching the first train is the probability of catching the main line train plus the probability of catching the harbor line train. The probability of catching the main line train is 1, as it is the first train to arrive. The probability of catching the harbor line train is the probability of the man arriving at the station after the main line train has left, which is 2 minutes. The probability of catching the harbor line train is thus 2/10, or 0.2.\n\nThus, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1 + 0.2 = 1.2.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the probability of a man catching the first train that arrives at the station, given the frequency and start times of the trains.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Trains**:\n   - Define constants for the frequency and start times of the trains.\n\n2. **Calculate the Probability of Catching the Main Line Train**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the probability of catching the main line train, which is 1.\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability of Catching the Harbor Line Train**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the probability of catching the harbor line train, which is the probability of the man arriving at the station after the main line train has left, which is 2 minutes.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Probability**:\n   - Use the calculated probabilities to determine the total probability of catching the first train, which is the sum of the probabilities of catching the main line and harbor line trains.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated total probability, ensuring it matches the expected result of 1.2.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the frequency and start times of the trains",

The problem states that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.\n\n#### Analyzing the Problem:\n- **Arjun's Money**: Let \\( A \\) represent the amount of money Arjun has.\n- **Sajal's Money**: Let \\( S \\) represent the amount of money Sajal has.\n- **Arjun Gives $30 to Sajal**: If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.

This can be represented as:\n\\[ A = 3(S - 10) \\]\n\n#### Solving the Problem:\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the values of \\( A \\) and \\( S \\) that satisfy both equations. We can do this by substituting the value of \\( S \\) from the first equation into the second equation and solving for \\( A \\):\n\\[ A = 3(2A - 30 - 10) \\]\n\\[ A = 6A - 120 \\]\n\\[ 6A - A = 120 \\]\n\\[ 5A = 120 \\]\n\\[ A = 24 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( A \\) into the first equation, we get:\n\\[ S = 2A - 30 \\]\n\\[ S = 2(24) - 30 \\]\n\\[ S = 48 - 30 \\]\n\\[ S = 18 \\]\n\nThus, Arjun has $24 and Sajal has $18.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the amount of money each friend has, given the conditions stated in the problem.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:\n   - Define variables for the amount of money Arjun and Sajal have.\n\n2. **Define the Conditions**",

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves two people, John and Mark, and their respective amounts of money. John has a certain amount of money, and Mark offers to give him half of it if he gives Mark Rs.75. However, John has a different offer, which is to give Mark one-third of his money if Mark gives him Rs.75. The question is, how much money did John have originally?\n\n#### Analyzing the Problem:\n- **John's Money**: Let's call John's original amount of money \\(x\\).\n- **Mark's Offer**: Mark offers to give John half of his money, which is \\(x/2\\).\n- **John's Offer**: John offers to give Mark one-third of his money, which is \\(x/3\\).\n- **Total Money**: The total amount of money after both offers is \\(x/2 + x/3 = 5x/6\\).\n- **Target Amount**: The target amount is Rs.75, which is the amount that Mark wants to give John.\n\n#### Calculating John's Original Amount:\n- **Equation**: To find John's original amount, we need to solve the equation \\(5x/6 = 75\\).\n- **Solving**: Dividing both sides by \\(5/6\\) gives us \\(x = 90\\).\n- **Result**: Therefore, John's original amount of money was Rs.90.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that John had Rs.90 originally, and Mark offered to give him half of that amount (Rs.45) if he gave Mark Rs.75.

If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?\n# Answer option: ['A)80\u00b0', 'B)130\u00b0', 'C)140\u00b0', 'D)160\u00b0', 'E)220\u00b0']",

Additionally, we are told that B bisects minor arc AC.\n\n#### Analyzing the Problem:\n- **Arcs**: Minor arc AC is 160\u00b0, and minor arc BD is 150\u00b0.\n- **Bisecting**: Point B bisects minor arc AC, meaning it divides it into two equal parts.\n\n#### Calculating the Measure of Minor Arc AD:\n1. **Determine the Measure of Minor Arc BC**:\n   - Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc BC is half of 160\u00b0, or 80\u00b0.\n\n2. **Determine the Measure of Minor Arc BD**:\n   - Minor arc BD is 150\u00b0.\n\n3. **Determine the Measure of Minor Arc AD**:\n   - Minor arc AD is the sum of minor arc BC and minor arc BD.\n   - Minor arc AD = 80\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 = 230\u00b0.\n\nFrom this analysis, the measure of minor arc AD is 230\u00b0.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the measure of minor arc AD, given the specified conditions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of letters (26) and the range of numbers (0-9).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations for Letters**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 distinct letters from the 26 available.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Numbers**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 numbers where each number can be from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two predicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the generation of combinations and ensure distinctness where required.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n   - Confirm the requirement for the letters to be distinct by checking the calculated total against the expected result (65000).\n\n",

        "question": "Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?\n# Answer option: ['A)3 hours', 'B)5 hours', 'C)6 hours', 'D)4 hours', 'E)7 hours']",
        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem is to determine how much time will pass before two cars travelling in the same direction are 15 miles apart. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph.\n\n#### Analyzing the Car Movement:\n- **Distance**: The cars are initially at the same point and are travelling in the same direction, so the distance between them is 0.\n- **Speed**: The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph.\n- **Time**: The time taken for the cars to travel a certain distance is inversely proportional to their speed.\n\n#### Calculating the Time:\n1. **Initial Distance**: The initial distance between the cars is 0.\n\n2. **Distance Traveled**: The distance traveled by each car is equal to its speed multiplied by the time taken.\n\n3. **Time Taken**: The time taken for the cars to travel a certain distance is inversely proportional to their speed. Therefore, the time taken by the first car is 15/55 = 0.27 hours, and the time taken by the second car is 15/52 = 0.29 hours.\n\n4. **Total Time**: The total time taken is the sum of the times taken by each car. Therefore, the total time taken is 0.27 + 0.29 = 0.56 hours.\n\nFrom this analysis, the time taken for the cars to be 15 miles apart is 0.56 hours, or 33.6 minutes.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time taken for two cars travelling in the same direction to be 15 miles apart, given their respective speeds.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the initial distance between the cars (0) and the distance to be traveled (15).\n   - Define the speeds of the two cars (55 and 52 mph).\n\n2. **Calculate Time Taken by Each Car**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the time taken by each car to travel a certain distance, given its speed.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Time**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the total time taken by both cars, given the time taken by each car.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total time",

Therefore, the time of departure is 2 hours.\n\n2. **Distance Traveled**: Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the distance traveled by each train is the same. The distance between City A and City B is 4 hours.\n\n3. **Time of Crossing**: To find the time of crossing, we need to calculate the time taken by each train to travel the distance between City A and City B. Since the trains are traveling at the same speed, the time taken by each train will be the same. Therefore, the time of crossing is 2 hours.\n\n4. **Verification**: To verify the result, we can calculate the time of crossing using the formula \\( t = \\frac{d}{v} \\), where \\( t \\) is the time taken, \\( d \\) is the distance traveled, and \\( v \\) is the speed of the train. For Train M, \\( t = \\frac{4}{1} = 4 \\) hours, and for Train N, \\( t = \\frac{4}{1} = 4 \\) hours.

This can be done by dividing 800 by 504, which gives us a ratio of 1.587. Therefore, to convert 504 marks to 800 marks, we multiply by 1.587.\n\n2. **Converting 420 Marks to 800 Marks**: To convert 420 marks to 800 marks, we need to find the ratio of 800 to 420. This can be done by dividing 800 by 420, which gives us a ratio of 1.904. Therefore, to convert 420 marks to 800 marks, we multiply by 1.904.\n\n#### Solving for M:\n1. **Equating the Ratios**: Since we know that the ratio of 800 to 504 is 1.587, and the ratio of 800 to 420 is 1.904, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[ \\frac{800}{504} = \\frac{800}{420} \\]\n   \\[ 1.587 = 1.904 \\]\n2. **Solving for M**: To solve for M, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 504:\n   \\[ 504 \\times 1.587 = 504 \\times 1.904 \\]\n   \\[ 800 = 960 \\]\n   Therefore, M = 960.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the value of M, given the information provided in the task.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create variables representing the marks obtained by the candidate and the maximum mark M.\n\n2. **Converting Marks**:\n   - Define a predicate that takes the marks obtained by the candidate and the maximum mark M as input and returns the converted marks.\n\n3. **Solving for M**:\n   - Define a predicate that takes the marks obtained by the candidate and the maximum mark M as input and returns the value of M",

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem is to determine the time taken by Anna to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and move just one book every minute.\n\n#### Analyzing the Problem:\n- **Number of Books**: Anna has 4 books.\n- **Combination**: The number of possible combinations of 4 books is 4! = 24.\n- **Time**: Anna moves one book every minute.\n\n#### Calculating the Time Taken:\n1. **Time for Each Combination**: \n   - Each combination takes 4 minutes to arrange.\n   - Total time for all combinations = 4 \u00d7 24 = 96 minutes.\n\n2. **Time for Moving Books**: \n   - Anna moves one book every minute.\n   - Total time for moving books = 96 minutes.\n\n3. **Total Time**: \n   - Total time = (Total time for all combinations) + (Total time for moving books).\n   - Total time = 96 + 96 = 192 minutes.\n\nFrom this analysis, the total time taken by Anna to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and move just one book every minute is 192 minutes.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total time taken by Anna to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and move just one book every minute.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the number of books (4) and the time taken to move one book (1 minute).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the number of combinations of 4 books (4!).\n\n3. **Calculate Time for Combinations**:\n   - Multiply the result of the combinations predicate by the time taken to move one book (4 \u00d7 1).\n\n4. **Calculate Time for Moving Books**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the time taken to move one book every minute (96 minutes).\n\n5. **Combine Results**:\n   - Add the results of the two predicates to get the total time taken.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total time taken by Anna.\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and calculate the total time taken by Anna.

This gives us a length of 12.33 feet for each painted side.\n\n2. **Determine the Width of the Parking Space**:\n   - Since the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, we can determine the width of the parking space by subtracting 9 from 12.33 (the length of the painted side). This gives us a width of 3.33 feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - The area of the parking space is the product of its length and width, which is 9 x 3.33 = 30 square feet.\n\nFrom this analysis, the area of the parking space is 30 square feet.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the area of a rectangular parking space given the length of one unpainted side and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create variables to represent the length of the unpainted side and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides.\n\n2. **Calculate the Length of the Painted Sides**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in arithmetic operations to divide the sum of the lengths of the painted sides by 3 to determine the length of each painted side.\n\n3. **Calculate the Width of the Parking Space**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in arithmetic operations to subtract the length of the unpainted side from the length of each painted side to determine the width of the parking space.\n\n4. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in arithmetic operations to multiply the length and width of the parking space to determine its area.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated area of the parking space.\n\nBy leveraging Prolog",

Therefore, Statement I must be true.\n\n- Statement II: If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, then Q has 5 factors (i.e., 1, Q, the prime number, the prime number squared, and the prime number cubed). Therefore, Statement II must be true.\n\n- Statement III: If Q is the product of two prime numbers, then Q has 5 factors (i.e., 1, Q, the first prime number, the second prime number, and the product of the two prime numbers). Therefore, Statement III must be true.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that Statements I, II, and III must all be true about a positive integer Q that has 5 factors.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that determines whether a",

        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work, we need to consider the following:\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours.\n- He finishes two-thirds of the work.\n- The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate is 5% of what Jack can do.\n\n#### Calculating the Time Taken:\n1. **Jack's Rate**:\n   - Jack's rate is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.\n   - Since he finishes two-thirds of the work, he completes 2/3 of the yacht.\n\n2. **Jill's Rate**:\n   - Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, which is 5/100 of 1/12 of the yacht per hour.\n   - This means she can clean 5/1200 of the yacht per hour.\n\n3. **Time Taken**:\n   - The time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work is the ratio of the remaining work to her rate:\n   \\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining Work}}{\\text{Jill's Rate}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ of the yacht}}{\\frac{5}{1200} \\text{ of the yacht per hour}} = 22 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work is 22 hours.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time taken by Jill to finish the remaining work given the rate of Jack and the portion of the work completed by him.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define constants for the rate of Jack and the portion of the work completed by him.\n   - These can be set as facts in Prolog.\n\n2. **Calculate Jill's Rate**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate Jill's rate as 5% of Jack's rate.\n\n3. **Compute Remaining Work**:\n   - Calculate the remaining work as the difference between the total work and the portion completed by Jack.\n\n4. **Calculate Time Taken**:\n   - Divide the remaining work by Jill's rate to get the time taken.\n   - This involves defining a predicate that takes the remaining work and Jill's rate and returns the time taken.\n\n5. **Use Pro",

        "question": "Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?\n# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)5', 'C)6', 'D)7', 'E)8']",
        "plan": "<|im_start|>assistant\n### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves two friends, P and Q, eating candies from a jar. P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes, while Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes. The question is how long it will take them to empty the jar if they are eating simultaneously.\n\n#### Analyzing the Problem:\n- **Rate of Consumption**: P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes, while Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes.\n- **Time Required**: The time required to empty the jar is the minimum of the two rates of consumption.\n\n#### Calculation of Time Required:\n1. **P's Rate of Consumption**: P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes, so his rate of consumption is 1 jar per 10 minutes.\n2. **Q's Rate of Consumption**: Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, so her rate of consumption is 1 jar per 10 minutes.\n3. **Combined Rate of Consumption**: The combined rate of consumption is the minimum of the two rates, which is 1 jar per 10 minutes.\n4. **Time Required**: The time required to empty the jar is the reciprocal of the combined rate of consumption, which is 10 minutes.\n\nFrom this analysis, the time required to empty the jar is 10 minutes, assuming both friends are eating simultaneously.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time required to empty a jar of candies when two friends are eating simultaneously, given their individual rates of consumption.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the rate of consumption for P (1 jar per 10 minutes) and Q (1 jar per 10 minutes).\n\n2. **Calculate Combined Rate of Consumption**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the minimum of the two rates of consumption.\n\n3. **Calculate Time Required**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the reciprocal of the combined rate of consumption.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the time required to empty the jar.\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and determine the time required to empty the jar.
