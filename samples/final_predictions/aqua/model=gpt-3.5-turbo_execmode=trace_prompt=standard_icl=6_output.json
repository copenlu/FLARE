For a square, all sides are equal, so if \\( s \\) is the length of one side:\n\\[ 4s = 88 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{88 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 22 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThus, each side of the square formed by rebending the wire will measure 22 cm.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the side of a square formed by rebending a wire that originally formed a rectangle, given the rectangle's dimensions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Rectangle Dimensions**:\n   - Define constants for the length and breadth of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula \\( P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Side of the Square**:\n   - Using the perimeter calculated, determine the side of the square using the relation \\( 4s = P \\).\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic directly in the predicate to compute the side of the square.\n   - Ensure the calculation is done using integer arithmetic to match the expected results (whole numbers).\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated side of the square, ensuring it matches the expected result of 22 cm.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the dimensions of the rectangle\nrectangle_length(27).\nrectangle_breadth(17).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nrectangle_perimeter(Perimeter) :-\n    rectangle_length(Length),\n    rectangle_breadth(Breadth),\n    Perimeter is 2 * (Length + Breadth).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the side of the square\nsquare_side(Side) :-\n    rectangle_perimeter(Perimeter),\n    Side is Perimeter / 4.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_square_side :-\n    square_side(Side),\n    format('Each side of the square is ~w cm.', [Side]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code effectively uses basic arithmetic operations and predicates to solve the problem, demonstrating Prolog's capability to handle mathematical calculations and logical reasoning."

The time is given based on the change in the angle of elevation from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.\n\n#### Understanding the Scenario:\n- The car is moving towards the base of the tower.\n- The angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes.\n\n#### Mathematical Analysis:\n1. **Initial Angle of Elevation**: 45\u00b0\n2. **Final Angle of Elevation**: 60\u00b0\n3. **Time Taken for Angle Change**: 10 minutes\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to consider the trigonometric relationship between the angle of elevation, the height of the tower, and the distance traveled by the car.\n\n#### Trigonometric Relationship:\n- The tangent of the angle of elevation is equal to the height of the tower divided by the distance traveled by the car.\n- Using this relationship, we can set up equations based on the given angles and the time taken.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the additional time needed for the car to reach the base of the tower after observing the change in the angle of elevation.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the initial angle of elevation, final angle of elevation, and the time taken for the angle change as facts in Prolog.\n\n2. **Calculate Height of the Tower**:\n   - Use trigonometry to calculate the height of the tower based on the initial and final angles of elevation.\n\n3. **Calculate Distance Traveled by the Car**:\n   - Use the tangent function and the height of the tower to calculate the distance traveled by the car.\n\n4. **Calculate Speed of the Car**:\n   - Use the time taken for the angle change and the distance traveled to calculate the speed of the car.\n\n5. **Calculate Additional Time to Reach the Base**:\n   - Use the speed of the car and the height of the tower to determine the additional time needed to reach the base of the tower.\n\n6. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the necessary trigonometric calculations and arithmetic operations using Prolog's arithmetic predicates.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated additional time needed for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nBy structuring the Prolog code to handle each step of the trigonometric calculations and time determination, we can accurately compute the time needed for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Additionally, we need to find out how many of the letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Analyzing the Bike Number Format:\n- **Format**: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n- **Letters**: Assuming the use of the English alphabet, there are 26 possible letters.\n- **Numbers**: Each number can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values per number position.\n\n#### Calculation of Total Combinations:\n1. **Letter Combinations**: \n   - If both letters need to be distinct, the number of combinations for the first letter is 26, and for the second letter, it is 25 (since it cannot be the same as the first).\n   - Total distinct letter combinations = \\( 26 \\times 25 \\).\n\n2. **Number Combinations**:\n   - Each of the two number positions can be any of 10 digits (0-9).\n   - Total number combinations = \\( 10 \\times 10 \\).\n\n3. **Total Bike Numbers**:\n   - Total combinations = (Total distinct letter combinations) \u00d7 (Total number combinations).\n   - Total combinations = \\( (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 10) = 65000 \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 65,000, assuming both letters need to be distinct.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using the specified format and checks how many letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of letters (26) and the range of numbers (0-9).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations for Letters**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 distinct letters from the 26 available.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Numbers**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 numbers where each number can be from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two predicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the generation of combinations and ensure distinctness where required.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n   - Confirm the requirement for the letters to be distinct by checking the calculated total against the expected result (65000).\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and confirm the conditions regarding the distinctness of letters.

Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as an unknown number of pita breads.\n\n#### Let's Break Down the Relationships:\n- **Pita Breads to Rolls**: 6 pita breads = 2 rolls\n- **Rolls to Baguettes**: 3 rolls = 5 baguettes\n- **Baguettes to Pita Breads**: 2 baguettes = x pita breads\n\n#### Mathematical Analysis:\n1. **Pita Breads to Rolls**:\n   - If 6 pita breads = 2 rolls, then 1 pita bread = 2/6 rolls = 1/3 rolls.\n\n2. **Rolls to Baguettes**:\n   - If 3 rolls = 5 baguettes, then 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes.\n\n3. **Baguettes to Pita Breads**:\n   - If 2 baguettes = x pita breads, then 1 baguette = x/2 pita breads.\n\n4. **Combining Relationships**:\n   - From the above relationships, we can equate the amount of falafel in terms of pita breads:\n     - 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes = 5/3 * (x/2) pita breads\n     - Simplifying, we get x = (2 * 3 * 1) / 5 = 6/5 = 12/10 = 6/5\n\nTherefore, the amount of falafel in 2 baguettes is equivalent to 6/5 pita breads.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to determine the relationship between the amount of falafel in different types of bread based on the given information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Relationships**:\n   - Define the relationships between pita breads, rolls, and baguettes in terms of the amount of falafel they contain.\n\n2. **Calculate the Equivalent Amounts**:\n   - Calculate the equivalent amount of falafel in terms of pita breads for rolls and baguettes based on the given relationships.\n\n3. **Use Prolog Arithmetic**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations to find the amount of falafel in pita breads equivalent to 2 baguettes.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated result, showing the relationship between the amount of falafel in 2 baguettes and pita breads.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the relationships between the bread types\nbread_relationships(PitaToRolls, RollsToBaguettes, BaguettesToPita) :-\n    PitaToRolls is 6 / 2,\n    RollsToBaguettes is 3 / 5,\n    BaguettesToPita is 2 / (5/3) / 2.\n\n% Query to find the amount of falafel in pita breads equivalent to 2 baguettes\nfind_pita_equivalent(PitaEquivalent) :-\n    bread_relationships(_, _, BaguettesToPita),\n    PitaEquivalent is 2 * BaguettesToPita.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code effectively captures the relationships between the different types of bread and calculates the equivalent amount of falafel in pita breads for 2 baguettes.

The number of ways to distribute the bottles can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items (lime soda bottles).\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to be chosen (number of bottles for one group).\n- \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of \\( n \\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).\n\n#### Calculation Steps:\n1. **Selecting Bottles for One Group**:\n   - Choose 5 bottles out of 10 for one group: \\( C(10, 5) = \\frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} \\)\n\n2. **Distributing Remaining Bottles**:\n   - The remaining 5 bottles automatically go to the second group.\n\n3. **Total Ways to Create Groups**:\n   - Since the two groups are distinct, the total ways to create the groups is the product of the ways to select bottles for one group and the ways to distribute the remaining bottles: \\( C(10, 5) \\times 1 \\)\n\n4. **Solving the Calculation**:\n   - Calculate the value of \\( C(10, 5) \\) to determine the total number of ways.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the number of ways to distribute 10 lime soda bottles among two groups of 5 members each.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Combination Predicate**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the combination of \\( n \\) items taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Ways**:\n   - Calculate the number of ways to distribute 10 bottles among two groups of 5 members each.\n\n3. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates to compute the factorial and perform the combination calculation.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of ways to create the two groups.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the combination predicate\ncombination(N, K, Result) :-\n    factorial(N, FN),\n    factorial(K, FK),\n    NK is N - K,\n    factorial(NK, FNK),\n    Result is FN / (FK * FNK).\n\n% Define the factorial predicate\nfactorial(0, 1).\nfactorial(N, Result) :-\n    N > 0,\n    N1 is N - 1,\n    factorial(N1, Result1),\n    Result is N * Result1.\n\n% Calculate the total ways to distribute the bottles\ntotal_ways(Total) :-\n    combination(10, 5, Ways),\n    Total is Ways.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_total_ways :-\n    total_ways(Total),\n    format('The total number of ways to create the two groups is: ~w', [Total]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code effectively calculates the total number of ways to distribute the lime soda bottles among two groups of 5 members each using the combination formula.
