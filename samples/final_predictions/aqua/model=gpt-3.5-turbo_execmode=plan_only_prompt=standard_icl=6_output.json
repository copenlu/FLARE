For a square, all sides are equal, so if \\( s \\) is the length of one side:\n\\[ 4s = 88 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{88 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 22 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThus, each side of the square formed by rebending the wire will measure 22 cm.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the side of a square formed by rebending a wire that originally formed a rectangle, given the rectangle's dimensions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Rectangle Dimensions**:\n   - Define constants for the length and breadth of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula \\( P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Side of the Square**:\n   - Using the perimeter calculated, determine the side of the square using the relation \\( 4s = P \\).\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic directly in the predicate to compute the side of the square.\n   - Ensure the calculation is done using integer arithmetic to match the expected results (whole numbers).\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated side of the square, ensuring it matches the expected result of 22 cm.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the dimensions of the rectangle\nrectangle_length(27).\nrectangle_breadth(17).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nrectangle_perimeter(Perimeter) :-\n    rectangle_length(Length),\n    rectangle_breadth(Breadth),\n    Perimeter is 2 * (Length + Breadth).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the side of the square\nsquare_side(Side) :-\n    rectangle_perimeter(Perimeter),\n    Side is Perimeter / 4.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_square_side :-\n    square_side(Side),\n    format('Each side of the square is ~w cm.', [Side]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code effectively uses basic arithmetic operations and predicates to solve the problem, demonstrating Prolog's capability to handle mathematical calculations and logical reasoning."

For the word \"PROBLEC\":\n   \\[ 7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040 \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the number of distinct 7-letter words that can be formed from \"PROBLEC\" is 5040, corresponding to \\( 7! \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the number of permutations for the given set of letters in \"PROBLEC\".\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Input**:\n   - Create a list representing the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\".\n\n2. **Permutation Calculation**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in permutation predicate or define a custom one to generate all possible permutations of the list of letters.\n\n3. **Counting Permutations**:\n   - Use Prolog\u2019s aggregation predicates to count the number of unique permutations generated from the original list. This step involves listing all permutations and then counting them.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Counting Capabilities**:\n   - Implement efficient search through the space of all permutations of the provided letters.\n   - Use the `findall` predicate to gather all permutations and the `length` predicate to count them, ensuring we get the factorial number as calculated analytically.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of permutations, verifying that it matches \\( 7! = 5040 \\).\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's capabilities in handling lists and permutations efficiently, we can directly and effectively compute the solution to the problem.
