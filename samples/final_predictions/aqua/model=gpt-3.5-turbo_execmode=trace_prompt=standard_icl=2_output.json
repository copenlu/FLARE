Additionally, we need to determine how many of the letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Analyzing the Bike Number Format:\n- **Format**: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n- **Letters**: Assuming the use of the English alphabet, there are 26 possible letters.\n- **Numbers**: Each number can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values per number position.\n\n#### Calculation of Total Combinations:\n1. **Letter Combinations**: \n   - If both letters need to be distinct, the number of combinations for the first letter is 26, and for the second letter, it is 25 (since it cannot be the same as the first).\n   - Total distinct letter combinations = \\( 26 \\times 25 \\).\n\n2. **Number Combinations**:\n   - Each of the two number positions can be any of 10 digits (0-9).\n   - Total number combinations = \\( 10 \\times 10 \\).\n\n3. **Total Bike Numbers**:\n   - Total combinations = (Total distinct letter combinations) \u00d7 (Total number combinations).\n   - Total combinations = \\( (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 10) = 65000 \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 65,000, assuming both letters need to be distinct.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using the specified format and checks how many letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of letters (26) and the range of numbers (0-9).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations for Letters**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 distinct letters from the 26 available.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Numbers**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 numbers where each number can be from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two predicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the generation of combinations and ensure distinctness where required.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n   - Confirm the requirement for the letters to be distinct by checking the calculated total against the expected result (65000).\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and confirm the conditions regarding the distinctness of letters.

The lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are provided as 5, 17, and 22, respectively. We need to determine the length of line segment RU.\n\n#### Key Points:\n- U is the midpoint of ST, which means that SU = UT.\n- The total length of ST is 22, with SU = UT, so each half (SU and UT) is 11.\n- RS + ST = RT, so RS + 22 = 17, which means RS = -5. However, distances are always positive, so RS = 5.\n- Since U is the midpoint of ST, RU is the sum of SU and RS.\n\n#### Calculating RU:\n- SU = UT = 11\n- RS = 5\n- RU = SU + RS = 11 + 5 = 16\n\nTherefore, the length of line segment RU is 16 units.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the length of line segment RU given the lengths of RS, RT, and ST.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Define constants for the lengths of RS, RT, and ST.\n   - Calculate the length of SU and RS based on the given information.\n\n2. **Calculate RU**:\n   - Determine the length of RU by adding the lengths of SU and RS.\n\n3. **Implement Prolog Code**:\n   - Define predicates to calculate the length of RU based on the calculated lengths of SU and RS.\n\n4. **Use Prolog Arithmetic**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations.\n   - Ensure that the code handles negative distances appropriately.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated length of RU to verify that it matches the expected value of 16 units.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants\nrs_length(5).\nrt_length(17).\nst_length(22).\n\n% Calculate SU and RS lengths\nsu_length(ST_Length, SU) :-\n    SU is ST_Length / 2.\n\n% Calculate RU length\nru_length(SU, RS, RU) :-\n    RU is SU + RS.\n\n% Calculate lengths and find RU\nfind_ru_length(RU) :-\n    st_length(ST),\n    su_length(ST, SU),\n    rs_length(RS),\n    ru_length(SU, RS, RU).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines predicates to calculate the length of line segment RU based on the given lengths of RS, RT, and ST.

Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the side length of the cube, i.e., \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\).\n\n#### Ratio of Volumes:\n- The ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is:\n  \\[ \\frac{V_{\\text{cube}}}{V_{\\text{sphere}}} = \\frac{a^3}{\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3} = \\frac{a^3}{\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{a^3}{8}\\right)} = \\frac{8}{3\\pi} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is \\( \\frac{8}{3\\pi} \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate and determine the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which fits inside the cube.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Formulas**:\n   - Define predicates for calculating the volume of a cube and the volume of a sphere based on the given formulas.\n\n2. **Calculate the Ratio**:\n   - Calculate the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere using the derived formula.\n\n3. **Implement Prolog Search**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the necessary calculations for the volume ratio.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated ratio of volumes as the final result.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the volume calculation predicates\ncube_volume(Side, Volume) :- Volume is Side * Side * Side.\nsphere_volume(Radius, Volume) :- Volume is (4/3) * pi * Radius * Radius * Radius.\n\n% Calculate the ratio of cube volume to sphere volume\nvolume_ratio(Ratio) :-\n    Side = 2,  % Assume side length of cube as 2 for simplicity\n    cube_volume(Side, CubeVol),\n    Radius is Side / 2,\n    sphere_volume(Radius, SphereVol),\n    Ratio is CubeVol / SphereVol.\n\n% Display the ratio of volumes\ndisplay_ratio :-\n    volume_ratio(Ratio),\n    format('The ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is: ~2f', [Ratio]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code defines predicates to calculate the volumes of a cube and a sphere, computes the ratio of their volumes, and then displays the calculated ratio.
