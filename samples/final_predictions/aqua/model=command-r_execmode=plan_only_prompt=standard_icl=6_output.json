This approach also makes the code modular and easier to understand or modify."

Then, \\( t = 10 \\) minutes.\n\n#### Relating Angle and Time:\nThe relationship between the angle of elevation (\u03b8), the time taken (t), and the height of the tower (h) can be described by the tangent function:\n\\[ \\tan(\u03b8) = \\frac{\\text{Height of the Tower}}{\\text{Distance Traveled in Time } t} \\]\n\n1. **For the First Angle**:\n   \\[ \\tan(45\u00b0) = \\frac{h}{d} \\]\n\n2. **For the Second Angle**:\n   \\[ \\tan(60\u00b0) = \\frac{h + \\Delta h}{d + \\Delta d} \\]\n   (Where \u0394h is the additional height covered by the tower's top during the time \u0394\u03b8, and \u0394d is the additional distance traveled by the car.)\n\n3. **Relating the Two Equations**:\n   - Setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for \u0394t (the additional time required), we get:\n   \\[ \\frac{h + \\Delta h}{d + \\Delta d} = \\tan(60\u00b0) = \\sqrt{3} \\times \\frac{h}{d} \\]\n   \\[ \\Delta d = \\sqrt{3} \\times d, \\quad \\Delta h = \\sqrt{3} \\times h \\]\n   \\[ \\Delta t = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} d}{v} \\]\n   where \\( v \\) is the velocity (speed) of the car.\n\n4. **Applying the Change**:\n   - With \\( \\Delta t = 15 \\) minutes (change in time), \\( \\tan(15\u00b0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\), and \\( d \\) and \\( h \\) both positive, we get:\n   \\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}h = \\frac{1}{2}vd \\]\n   \\[ h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}vd \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Additional Time**:\n   \\[ \\Delta t = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} d}{v} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 15 \\text{ min} = 11.25 \\text{ min} \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, the car will reach the base of the tower after an additional \\( 11.25 \\) minutes, which corresponds to option 'A'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the additional time required for the car to reach the base of the tower based on the given angle changes and uniform speed.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Inputs**:\n   - Set constants for the initial angle \\( Angle1 \\), the final angle \\( Angle2 \\), and the time \\( Time1 \\) taken for the angle change.\n   - Accept the speed of the car as input.\n\n2. **Calculate Change in Angle and Time**:\n   - Compute \\( DeltaAngle \\) and \\( DeltaTime \\) based on the difference between \\( Angle2 \\) and \\( Angle1 \\), and \\( Time2 - Time1 \\) respectively.\n\n3. **Implement Trigonometric Relations**:\n   - Use Prolog's math predicates to implement the trigonometric relations between the angles and the ratios of height to distance.\n\n4. **Calculate the Height**:\n   - Use the given height-distance relation \\( h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}vd \\) to compute the height \\( h \\) based on the speed \\( v \\) and a suitable distance constant.\n\n5. **Determine Additional Time**:\n   - Calculate \\( DeltaDistance \\) using \\( h \\) and \\( v \\), and then compute \\( DeltaTime \\) using \\( Delta",

We aim to find the average speed.\n\n#### Calculating Average Speed:\n1. **Addition of Side Lengths**:\n   - The total distance traveled by the plane is the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square. Since each side is of equal length, we can multiply the length of one side by 4:\n   \\[ \\text{Total Distance} = 4 \\times \\text{Side Length} \\]\n\n2. **Calculating Time**:\n   - Now, we need to find the total time taken to travel along the square's sides.

Let's break down the problem:\n\n#### Understanding the Relationship:\nThe statement \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\" implies that the difference in ages between Q and R is the same as the difference in ages between T and Q. This creates a pair of equations.\n\n#### Analyzing the Ages:\nLet's assume:\n- R's age = x years\n- T's age = y years\n- Q's age = z years\n\nWe are also given the sum of the ages of R and T, which can be expressed as:\n\\[ x + y = 50 \\]\n\nThe relationship between Q, R, and T can be written as:\n\\[ z - x = x - y \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( x + y \\) from the given sum into this equation:\n\\[ z - x = x - (50 - x) \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ z = 2x \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the first equation:\n\\[ x - y = x - (z - x) \\]\n\\[ y = z/2 \\]\n\nWith these equations, we can now find the difference between R's age (\\( x \\)) and Q's age (\\( z \\)):\n\\[ |x - z| = |x - 2x| = x\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the age difference between R and Q based on the given relationship and the sum of the ages of R and T.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Define the ages of R, T, and Q as Prolog variables.\n\n2. **Establish Relationships**:\n   - Use logical assertions to express the relationship that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nWe are asked to find the number of three-digit numbers represented by M, which are larger than N (where N = cba), under the condition that M - N + 396c equals 990.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- M and N are three-digit numbers.\n- M is larger than N.\n- We have the equation M - N + 396c = 990.\n\n#### Solving the Equation:\n1. **Simplifying the Equation**:\n   - M - N can be rewritten as a difference of two-digit numbers. Let's assume the tens digit of M is \\( x \\) and the units digit is \\( y \\). Then, M - N can be written as \\( 10x - 10y \\).\n   - According to the equation, \\( M - N + 396c = 990 \\), which can be rearranged to \\( 10x - 10y + 396c = 990 \\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)**:\n   - We can solve the equation to find that \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Valid Values for \\( c \\)**:\n   - The value of \\( c \\) should satisfy \\( 396c = 990 \\), which leads to \\( c = 2.5 \\). However, since we have a limited range of values for the digits (0-9), we can conclude that \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nWith \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 1 \\), and \\( c = 2 \\), we can now determine the possible values of M.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to find the number of valid values for M that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Conditions**:\n   - Implement predicates to represent the conditions \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 1 \\), and \\( c = 2 \\).\n\n2. **Search for Valid M Values**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in predicates for comparing numbers and generating digits to search for all possible values of M that satisfy the conditions.\n\n3. **Count the Values**:\n   - Use aggregation predicates in Prolog to count the number of valid values found in the search.\n\n4. **Handle the Edge Case**:\n   - Consider and handle the case where M has a leading zero (e.g., 041). This will ensure that we don't miss any valid M values.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the count of valid M values, ensuring it matches the expected number.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the conditions\nx_is_4 :- true.\ny_is_1 :- true.\nc_is_2 :- true.\n\n% Predicate to check and count valid M values\ncount_valid_m(Count) :-\n    % Define the range of M values (three digits)\n    between(100, 999, M),\n    \n    % Check if M satisfies the conditions\n    (   M =\\= 411 % M must not be equal to 411 (N in cba form)\n        ; true\n    ),\n    \n    % Extract digits of M\n    extract_digits(M, X, Y),\n    \n    % Check if digits satisfy the conditions\n    (   x_is_4,\n        y_is_1,\n        c_is_2,\n        M_valid\n    ->  M_valid = true\n    ;   M_valid = false\n    ),\n    \n    % Increment the count for each valid M\n    (   M_valid -> Count++\n    ;   true\n    ).\n\n% Predicate to extract digits from a number\nextract_digits(100 * X + 10 * Y + Z, X, Y) :-\n    Z = 0. % Ignore the leading zero, if present\n\n% Initialize and query the count\ncount_m_values(Count) :-\n    Count = 0,\n    count_valid_m(Count),\n    format('Number of values of M > 300: ~w~n', [Count]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code approaches the problem logically, checking each possible value of M and aggregating the count of valid values.

If both x and y are small positive values close to 0, say 1 or 2, we have:\n   - L(x, y) \u2248 [1] + [2] + [3] = 3\n   - R(x, y) \u2248 [2] + [4] = 3\n\n2. As x and y increase, L(x, y) and R(x, y) will generally increase as well, but their behavior differs.\n   - For example, if x = y = 3, then L(x, y) = [3] + [3] + [6] = 6, while R(x, y) = [6] + [6] = 6. So, for certain values, they might be equal.\n\n3. However, as we vary x and y, we'll notice that L(x, y) tends to be lower than R(x, y) because doubling the variables in R(x, y) causes the greatest integer values to increase by 1.\n\nFrom this analysis, it's evident that L(x, y) will rarely be equal to R(x, y) for positive x and y, and when they do equal, the values involved might not be positive integers.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to verify the relationship between L(x, y) and R(x, y) and confirm that finding equal values is rare.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Functions**:\n   - Define predicates to compute L(x, y) and R(x, y) using the greatest integer function `[x]`.\n\n2. **Explore the Function Behavior**:\n   - Experiment with different values of x and y to observe the behavior of both functions.\n\n3. **Search for Equal Values**:\n   - Use a systematic approach to search for pairs of positive x and y values that satisfy L(x, y) = R(x, y).\n\n4. **Verify Solutions**:\n   - Ensure that the found solutions indeed correspond to positive real numbers.\n\n5. **Check Inequality**:\n   - Based on the analysis, modify the code to verify that for most pairs of positive x and y, L(x, y) will be different from R(x, y).\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the greatest integer function\n[X] :-\n    integer_part(X).\n\n% Define predicates for L(x,y) and R(x,y)\nL(X, Y) :-\n    [X] + [Y] + [X + Y] =:= Z,\n    write(L = Z), nl.\n\nR(X, Y) :-\n    [2*X] + [2*Y] =:= Z,\n    write(R = Z), nl.\n\n% Search for equal values of L and R\nsearch_equal_values(X, Y) :-\n    num(X), num(Y),\n    L(X, Y),\n    R(X, Y),\n    write('L(X,Y) = R(X,Y) for X = '), write(X), write(' and Y = '), write(Y), nl.\n\n% Search for inequality\nsearch_inequality :-\n    findall(X*100+Y, (num(X), num(Y), L(X, Y), R(X, Y), \\+ (L(X, Y) = R(X, Y))), List),\n    length(List, Length),\n    write('Total pairs where L(X,Y) != R(X,Y): '), write(Length).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code will experimentally verify the analysis by searching for equal and different values of L(x, y) and R(x, y) among positive real numbers.

Let's analyze this mathematically:\n\nThe product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as:\n\\[ (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) \\]\n\nWe want this product to equal the specified sum:\n\\[ (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) = 727 + 728 + 729 \\]\n\nNow, expand and equate the left and right sides of the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n&x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6  = 2184 \\\\\n&x^3 + 6x^2 + 6x - 15x + 6 = 2181 - 15x \\\\\n&x^3 - 9x^2 + 6x = 2166 \\\\\n&x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 18 = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis equation can be solved using the rational root theorem, which states that a rational root of a polynomial must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, 18). Since 18 is a factor of 2166, we can guess the root \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nSolving the equation \\( x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 18 = 0 \\) using the guess \\( x = 3 \\), we find that \\( x = 3 \\) is indeed a solution.\n\nThe three consecutive integers then must be \\( 3, 4, \\) and \\( 5 \\).
