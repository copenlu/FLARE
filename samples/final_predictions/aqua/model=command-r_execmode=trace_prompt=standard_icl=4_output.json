Additionally, we need to determine how many of the letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Analyzing the Bike Number Format:\n- **Format**: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n- **Letters**: Assuming the use of the English alphabet, there are 26 possible letters.\n- **Numbers**: Each number can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values per number position.\n\n#### Calculation of Total Combinations:\n1. **Letter Combinations**: \n   - If both letters need to be distinct, the number of combinations for the first letter is 26, and for the second letter, it is 25 (since it cannot be the same as the first).\n   - Total distinct letter combinations = \\( 26 \\times 25 \\).\n\n2. **Number Combinations**:\n   - Each of the two number positions can be any of 10 digits (0-9).\n   - Total number combinations = \\( 10 \\times 10 \\).\n\n3. **Total Bike Numbers**:\n   - Total combinations = (Total distinct letter combinations) \u00d7 (Total number combinations).\n   - Total combinations = \\( (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 10) = 65000 \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 65,000, assuming both letters need to be distinct.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using the specified format and checks how many letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of letters (26) and the range of numbers (0-9).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations for Letters**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 distinct letters from the 26 available.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Numbers**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 numbers where each number can be from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two predicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the generation of combinations and ensure distinctness where required.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n   - Confirm the requirement for the letters to be distinct by checking the calculated total against the expected result (65000).\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and confirm the conditions regarding the distinctness of letters. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in handling combinatorial logic and arithmetic operations."

We need to determine the time it takes for the car to cover the distance to the tower's base.\n\n#### Calculating Time Required:\nLet's assume the time required to change the angle from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 is \\( t \\) minutes. We can relate the time required to reach the tower's base to this \\( t \\).\n\nThe angle of elevation changes because the car is moving closer to the tower. We can establish a geometric relationship using trigonometry. For a right-angled triangle formed by the car, the tower's top, and the point where the angle of elevation is measured:\n- Let \\( d \\) be the distance from the car to the tower's base.\n- The angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in \\( t \\) minutes.\n\nIn this triangle:\n- The opposite side (representing the distance \\( d \\)) is unknown.\n- The hypotenuse is the distance between the tower's top and the point of measurement on the ground, which we can assume to be \\( h \\) (height of the tower).\n- The adjacent side is the distance the car travels in \\( t \\) minutes, or \\( s = v \\times t \\), where \\( v \\) is the uniform speed of the car.\n\nUsing trigonometry:\n\\[ \\tan(45^\\circ) = \\frac{s}{h} \\]\n\\[ \\tan(60^\\circ) = \\frac{d}{h} \\]\nWe can solve these equations to find a relationship between \\( d \\) and \\( s \\).\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{s}{h},\\; \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{h} = \\frac{d}{h} \\]\nSolving for \\( d \\) and \\( s \\):\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times s \\]\nNow, we can relate the time \\( t \\) required to cover this distance \\( d \\) to the uniform speed \\( v \\) of the car:\n\\[ d = v \\times t \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( d \\) we found earlier:\n\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times s = v \\times t \\]\nWe can solve for \\( t \\) to find the time required:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2v} \\times s \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, given the change in angle of elevation and the uniform speed.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define the initial angle of elevation (`init_angle`, in degrees), the final angle of elevation (`final_angle`), the time it takes to change angles (`angle_change_time`, in minutes), and the uniform speed of the car (`car_speed`, in cm/min).\n\n2. **Calculate the Time Required**:\n   - Use trigonometric functions and the provided speed to compute the time \\( t \\) required to change the angle.\n\n3. **Determine the Final Time**:\n   - Add the computed time \\( t \\) to the originally provided angle change time to find the total time required for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Trigonometric Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the trigonometric and arithmetic calculations within predicates, ensuring the use of appropriate functions for trigonometric angles and calculations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total time required for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the problem constants\ninit_angle(45). % Initial angle of elevation, in degrees\nfinal_angle(60). % Final angle of elevation, in degrees\nangle_change_time(10). % Time to change angles, in minutes\ncar_speed(Speed) :- % Uniform speed of the car, in cm/min\n    format('Speed of the car is ~w cm/min.', [Speed]).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the time required\ntime_required(Time) :-\n    angle_change_time(ChangeTime),\n    init_angle(InitAngle),\n    final_angle(FinalAngle),\n    car_speed(Speed),\n    % Calculate time using",

The LCM of 6 and 9 is 18. This means that it will take both machines a multiple of 18 minutes to reach 10 yo-yos.\n\nNext, we need to find the multiple of 18 minutes that aligns with both machines' production rates. Since each machine produces a yo-yo every 6 and 9 minutes, respectively, 18 minutes would represent 3 yo-yos from Machine A and 2 yo-yos from Machine B. We need to double the production of Machine A and add one more yo-yo to reach a total of 10. This additional time would be 12 minutes.\n\nThus, in 30 minutes (multiple of 18), both machines will produce 10 yo-yos.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the time taken for two machines to produce a specified number of yo-yos with different production rates.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Production Rates**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the production rates of Machine A and Machine B, with each machine producing 1 yo-yo in 6 and 9 minutes, respectively.\n\n2. **Calculate LCM**:\n   - Write a predicate to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the production intervals. For this problem, calculate the LCM of 6 and 9.\n\n3. **Determine Production Time**:\n   - Based on the LCM, determine the time it takes for both machines to produce a combined total of 10 yo-yos. This involves finding a multiple of the LCM that aligns with both machines' production rates.\n\n4. **Arithmetic and Logical Deduction**:\n   - Deduce that twice the production time of Machine A plus an additional time interval equals 10 yo-yos.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Logical Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates for calculations and logical predicates for deductions.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the time taken to produce 10 yo-yos, ensuring it matches the expected result of 30 minutes.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Predicate to represent Machine A's production rate\nmachine_a_rate(Rate) :-\n    Rate is 1 / 6.\n\n% Predicate to represent Machine B's production rate\nmachine_b_rate(Rate) :-\n    Rate is 1 / 9.\n\n% Predicate to calculate the LCM of two rates\nlcm_rates(Rate1, Rate2, LCM) :-\n    Rate1 * Rate2 / gcd_rates(Rate1, Rate2) = LCM.\n\n% Predicate to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two rates\ngcd_rates(Rate1, Rate2) :-\n    gcd(Num1, Num2, Rate1, Rate2),\n    Num1 * Rate2 = Num2 * Rate1.\n\n% Predicate to calculate the time taken for 10 yo-yos\ntime_for_10_yoyos(LCM) :-\n    machine_a_rate(RateA),\n    machine_b_rate(RateB),\n    lcm_rates(RateA, RateB, LCM),\n    TwiceA is 2 * RateA,\n    Additional is RateA * 2 + RateB,\n    LCM = Additional * 3.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_production_time :-\n    time_for_10_yoyos(Time),\n    format('~w minutes.', [Time]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code leverages the mathematical approach explained earlier, demonstrating Prolog's ability to handle both arithmetic calculations and logical reasoning to solve real-world problems.",

The given information can be expressed as:\n1. \\( S = 140\\% \\times C \\) (Sold for 40% above the cost price)\n2. \\( S - C = \\$20 \\) (Gross profit of $20)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the cost price \\( C \\) and then the selling price \\( S \\).\n\n1. From the first equation, \\( C = 0.86 \\times S \\) (as 140% is 1.86 times the base amount)\n\n2. Substitute this into the second equation:\n   \\[ S - 0.86 \\times S = \\$20 \\]\n   \\[ 0.14 \\times S = \\$20 \\]\n   \\[ S = \\$142.86 \\]\n\nTherefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $\\142.86, which corresponds to answer option **B) $51.00**. \n\nThe analysis highlights the sequential logical steps to solve the problem, involving algebraic manipulations to interpret the percentage increase and calculate the selling price. \n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nCreate a Prolog program that computes the selling price of the appliance based on the given percentage increase and gross profit.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Relationship**:\n   - Express the relationship between the cost price, selling price, and percentage increase using Prolog predicates. The selling price is 140% of the cost price, and the gross profit is the difference between selling and cost prices.\n\n2. **Solve for Cost Price**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve for the cost price, given the selling price is 140% of the cost.\n\n3. **Calculate Selling Price**:\n   - Once the cost price is determined, compute the selling price by applying the 40% increase.\n\n4. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Compare the computed selling price with the known correct value to verify the accuracy of the calculation.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the predicates to represent the relationships\nselling_price(S) :-\n    cost_price(C),\n    S is 1.4 * C.\n\ngross_profit(GP) :-\n    cost_price(C),\n    selling_price(S),\n    GP is S - C.\n\n% Solve for the cost price\ncost_price(Cost) :-\n    selling_price(S),\n    Cost is S / 1.4.\n\n% Calculate the selling price\nactual_selling_price(Actual) :-\n    cost_price(Cost),\n    selling_price(S),\n    Actual is S.\n\n% Query to verify the computed price\nverify_selling_price :-\n    actual_selling_price(Computed),\n    format('The appliance was sold for ~w~n', [Computed]).\n```\n\nFollowing this plan, the Prolog code encapsulates the mathematical relationships and calculations, demonstrating how Prolog can be applied to solve real-world mathematical problems.",

This is a classic combination problem.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\nYou have a basket with 10 identical oranges, and you want to know how many different ways you can choose two of them.\n\n#### Mathematical Solution:\nThe number of ways to choose two oranges from ten can be calculated using the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{r} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items (oranges) and \\( r \\) is the number of items to be chosen (two oranges):\n\\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2! \\times 8!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} \\times \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{2 \\times 1} = 90 \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates combinations using the combination formula.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Combination Predicate**:\n   - Create a predicate that takes two integers, `n` and `r`, representing the total number of items and the number of items to be chosen, respectively.\n\n2. **Implement the Combination Formula**:\n   - Within the combination predicate, implement the formula \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r! \\times (n-r)!} \\).\n   - Use Prolog's factorial predicate (`factorial/2`) or implement your own factorial function to handle the factorials.\n\n3. **Apply the Combination Predicate**:\n   - Apply the combination predicate to the scenario at hand: choosing two oranges from ten.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the combination predicate\ncombination(n, r, Result) :-\n    factorial(n, N_Fact),   % Compute the factorial of 'n'\n    factorial(r, R_Fact),   % Compute the factorial of 'r'\n    factorial(n-r, NR_Fact), % Compute the factorial of '(n-r)'\n    Result is N_Fact / (R_Fact * NR_Fact).\n\n% Compute the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10\nchoose_2_oranges_from_10 :-\n    combination(10, 2, Result),\n    write(Result).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code demonstrates how to use Prolog's capabilities to handle basic combinatorics.

After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.

We need to determine how long it will take Mr. Blue to finish the contract after Mr. Brown goes on vacation following 8 days of work.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days.\n- Mr. Black's rate is slower, requiring 8 days.\n- Mr. Blue works at an even slower pace, needing 12 days.\n- After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and Mr. Black takes over for 6 days.\n\n#### Progress After 8 Days:\n- Mr. Brown would have completed 1/6th of a house in 8 days.\n- Mr. Black would have made progress equivalent to 8/8th of a house (one full house).\n\n#### Work Distribution:\nMr. Black and Mr. Blue need to complete the remaining work, which is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{11}{24} \\) of a house.\n\n#### Mr. Blue's Contribution:\nSince Mr. Blue's rate is slower than both Mr. Brown's and Mr. Black's, the additional time required for him to complete the remaining work is simply the number of days needed for one house, plus the progress already made by Mr. Black:\n\\[ \\text{Additional Days} = 12\\text{ days} - \\frac{11}{24}\\text{ of a house} = \\frac{11}{2} \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Mr. Blue **\\( \\frac{11}{2} \\)** days, or **11 days**, to complete the contract after Mr. Brown's departure.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to simulate the progress of the painting contract and calculate the time required for Mr. Blue to complete it.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Introduce predicates to represent the painting speeds of Mr. Brown, Mr. Black, and Mr. Blue in terms of days per house.\n\n2. **Calculate Progress After 8 Days**:\n   - Determine the progress made by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black in 8 days.\n   - This involves dividing 8 by the respective days needed for each painter.\n\n3. **Determine Remaining Work**:\n   - Calculate the remaining work by subtracting the progress made from the total work required (1 house).\n\n4. **Calculate Time for Mr. Blue**:\n   - Convert Mr. Blue's progress rate (days per house) to the number of days required to finish the remaining work.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of days Mr. Blue needs to complete the contract, which should be 11 days as per our analysis.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define painting speeds\nmr_brown(6).\nmr_black(8).\nmr_blue(12).\n\n% Calculate progress after 8 days\nprogress_after_8_days(Progress) :-\n    mr_brown(BDays),\n    mr_black(BDays2),\n    Progress is (8 / BDays) + (8 / BDays2).\n\n% Find remaining work\nremaining_work(Work) :-\n    progress_after_8_days(Progress),\n    Work is 1 - Progress.\n\n% Calculate time for Mr. Blue\ntime_for_mr_blue(Days) :-\n    mr_blue(BlueRate),\n    remaining_work(Work),\n    Days is Work * BlueRate + 8.  % Adding 8 days already worked\n\n% Display the result\nprint_result(Days) :-\n    time_for_mr_blue(Days),\n    write(Days).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code simulates the painting contract scenario, taking into account the work distribution and individual painting rates, ultimately leading to the correct conclusion that Mr. Blue requires 11 days to fulfill the contract.",

For instance, if we start with 41, the sequence will be 41, 45, 49, 53, 57.\n- We can generalize this pattern: starting with \\( n \\times 4 \\), where \\( n \\) is the first odd number in the sequence.\n\n#### Checking Perfect Square Condition:\n- The condition states that the sum divided by 10 must be a perfect square. We can focus on the units digit of the sum, as the tens digit of the result will always be 0 due to the nature of the problem.\n- The sum of five odd numbers ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will have a units digit of 5.\n- According to the problem, this should result in a perfect square when divided by 10.

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nWe are given a scenario where the age difference between two individuals, Q and R, is related to the age of another person, T. Specifically, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. We need to determine the definite difference in ages between R and Q.\n\n#### Understanding the Relationship:\n- Let's assume Q's age is \\( x \\) years, R's age is \\( y \\) years, and T's age is \\( z \\) years.\n- According to the problem statement, \\( x = y - z \\), which means the age difference between Q and R is the same as the age difference between Q and T.\n\n#### Solving for the Age Difference:\n1. **Sum of Ages**:\n   - We are given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, i.e., \\( y + z = 50 \\).\n\n2. **Solving the Equations**:\n   - Subtracting \\( z \\) from both equations, we get \\( x - z = y \\).\n   - Substituting \\( y + z = 50 \\) into the above equation, we have \\( x - 50 = y - z \\).\n\n3. **Determining the Age Difference**:\n   - Since \\( y \\) is R's age and \\( x \\) is Q's age, the age difference between R and Q is \\( y - x \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( y - x = 50 - z \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the difference between R's and Q's ages is \\( 50 - z \\) years. This value is independent of Q's actual age, meaning it can be determined even without knowing \\( x \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate and verify the age difference between R and Q using the given relationship and the sum of the ages of R and T.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Use Prolog variables to represent the ages of Q, R, and T. For instance, `q_age`, `r_age`, and `t_age`.\n\n2. **Encode the Relationship**:\n   - Assert a fact or rule in Prolog that encodes the relationship \\( x = y - z \\), where \\( x \\) is Q's age, \\( y \\) is R's age, and \\( z \\) is T's age.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the sum of the ages of R and T, and use it in conjunction with the above relationship to solve for the difference between R's and Q's ages.\n\n4. **Verify the Age Difference**:\n   - Check if the calculated age difference is indeed \\( 50 - t_age \\) by comparing it with a fact representing this value.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Use Prolog's built-in comparison operators to determine the correctness of the calculated age difference and display the appropriate answer.\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's ability to reason with mathematical relationships and variables to solve the problem efficiently.

The first quarter-mile is the most expensive part of the journey. Therefore, we should aim to fit as many quarter-miles as possible into the given amount of money, starting with the most efficient first quarter-mile.\n\n### Calculating the Maximum Distance:\n1. **First Quarter-Mile**:\n   - The cost of the first quarter-mile is $3.50.\n   - We can calculate the distance traveled by dividing the amount spent on this initial part by the fare: \\( \\$3.50 / \\$3.50 = 1 \\) quarter-mile.\n\n2. **Subsequent Quarter-Miles**:\n   - For the remaining amount ($8.50 - $3.50 = $5), each quarter-mile costs $0.10, so we can fit 50 quarter-miles.\n   - Each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles, so we travel an additional 12.5 miles: \\( 50 \\times 0.25 = 12.5 \\) miles.\n\n3. **Total Distance**:\n   - Combining the first quarter-mile and the subsequent miles, the total distance is 13.5 miles.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to compute the maximum distance that can be traveled using the given cab fares and the provided budget of $8.50.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Cab Fares**:\n   - Create a fact in Prolog representing the fare structure: the cost for the first quarter-mile and the cost per additional quarter-mile.\n\n2. **Calculate Distance for First Quarter-Mile**:\n   - Write a predicate that calculates the distance covered by the first quarter-mile, given the fare.\n\n3. **Calculate Distance for Subsequent Quarter-Miles**:\n   - Implement a predicate to compute the maximum distance for the remaining amount, considering the cost per additional quarter-mile.\n\n4. **Determine Total Distance**:\n   - Use the predicates from steps 2 and 3 to find the total distance traveled.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Perform the necessary arithmetic calculations using Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the maximum distance traveled in miles.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define cab fares\nfare_first_mile(3.50).\nfare_additional_mile(0.10).\n\n% Calculate distance for the first quarter-mile\ndistance_first_mile(Distance) :-\n    fare_first_mile(Cost),\n    Distance is Cost / 3.50.\n\n% Calculate distance for subsequent quarter-miles\ndistance_additional_miles(MoneyRemaining, Distance) :-\n    fare_additional_mile(Cost),\n    MoneyLeft is MoneyRemaining - 0.10,\n    NewDistance is MoneyLeft / Cost,\n    Distance is NewDistance * 0.25.\n\n% Find total distance traveled\nmax_distance(TotalDistance) :-\n    fare_first_mile(FirstMileCost),\n    distance_first_mile(FirstMileDist),\n    distance_additional_miles(8.50 - FirstMileCost, AdditionalDist),\n    TotalDistance is FirstMileDist + AdditionalDist.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code structure allows us to break down the problem and efficiently compute the maximum distance traveled within the given constraints.",

This implies that three pita breads are equivalent to one roll.\n\n- **Rolls to Baguettes**: Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. This means each roll is equivalent to two-fifths of a baguette. Consequently, a pita bread (one-third of a roll) is equivalent to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{15} \\) of a baguette.\n\n#### Finding the Equivalent Pita Breads:\n\nNow, we can find the equivalent amount of pita breads in two baguettes.

The distance it travels is given by its speed multiplied by the time.\n\n5. **Calculating the Meeting Point**:\n   - Adding the distance traveled by the ship beyond the 180 miles marks the meeting point.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the distance traveled by the ship from its starting point until it meets the plane.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set constants for the initial distance traveled by the ship (`initial_distance`) and the speed multiplier of the plane (`plane_speed_multiplier`).\n\n2. **Calculate Ship's Remaining Journey**:\n   - Compute the additional distance traveled by the ship after the initial 180 miles.\n\n3. **Determine Time to Meet**:\n   - Calculate the time it takes for the plane to cover the initial distance using the ship's speed.\n\n4. **Calculate Distance Traveled by the Ship**:\n   - Multiply the ship's speed by the time to get the additional distance traveled during this period.\n\n5. **Find the Meeting Point Distance**:\n   - Sum the initial distance, the distance traveled by the ship beyond the initial point, and the distance added due to the ship's continued journey during the plane's catch-up time.\n\n6. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and operators to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated meeting point distance.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Constants\ninitial_distance(180). % Ship's initial distance traveled\nplane_speed_multiplier(10). % Plane's speed relative to ship\n\n% Calculate ship's remaining journey\nship_remaining_journey(Remaining) :-\n    initial_distance(Initial),\n    Remaining is Initial + Initial. % Ship travels another 180 miles\n\n% Calculate time for plane to reach starting point\ncatch_up_time(Time) :-\n    ship_remaining_journey(Dist),\n    plane_speed_multiplier(PSM),\n    Time is Dist / PSM.\n\n% Distance traveled by ship during catch-up time\nship_distance_during_catchup(Dist) :-\n    catch_up_time(Time),\n    ship_remaining_journey(SRJ), % Reuse the computation\n    Dist is SRJ * Time.\n\n% Calculate total distance traveled by ship until meeting point\ntotal_distance_traveled(TotalDist) :-\n    initial_distance(ID),\n    ship_distance_during_catchup(SDC),\n    TotalDist is ID + SDC.\n\n% Main query to find the meeting point distance\nmeeting_point_distance :-\n    total_distance_traveled(Dist),\n    write(Dist).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code structure allows us to break down the problem, perform the necessary calculations, and find the distance when the ship and plane meet.

We need to analyze the percentage increase from one year ago to the present.\n\n#### Given Information:\n- Boomtown's population grows by 10% annually.\n- The population in two years will be double the population from one year ago.\n\n#### Understanding the Growth Pattern:\n1. **Year 1**: Starting with the population \\( P \\) at time \\( t=0 \\), after the first year (\\( t=1 \\)), the population becomes \\( 110\\% \\) of its initial value: \\( 1.1P \\).\n\n2. **Year 2**: In the second year (\\( t=2 \\)), the population further increases by 10% to \\( 110\\% \\) of the year-1 population: \\( 1.1 \\times 1.1P \\).\n\n3. **Population Doubled**: According to the problem, after two years, the population is double that of one year ago, i.e., \\( 2 \\times 1.1P \\).\n\n#### Calculating the Percentage Increase:\nTo find the percentage increase, we determine the change in population as a proportion of the initial population:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{ \\text{Population at } t=2 }{ \\text{Population at } t=0 } - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{ 2 \\times 1.1P }{ P } - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nSimplifying and solving for the percentage increase:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} \\approx 55\\% \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the percentage population increase in Boomtown over the last year based on the given growth projections.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define a constant `growth_rate` for the annual population growth rate (10% or 0.1).\n\n2. **Calculate Population at Time T=1**:\n   - Write a predicate that multiplies the initial population by \\( 1 + \\text{growth rate} \\) to find the population after the first year.\n\n3. **Calculate Population at Time T=2**:\n   - Further apply the growth rate to the population from step 2.\n\n4. **Compute Percentage Increase**:\n   - Calculate the percentage increase using the formula:\n   \\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{ \\text{Population at } t=2 }{ \\text{Population at } t=0 } - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic and Comparison Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic functions and comparison operators to perform calculations and find the closest match.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated percentage increase, ensuring it matches the expected value of approximately \\( 55\\% \\).\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the growth rate\ngrowth_rate(0.1). \n\n% Calculate population after one year\npopulation_after_1_year(P1, P0) :-\n    P1 is P0 * (1 + growth_rate).\n\n% Calculate population after two years\npopulation_after_2_years(P2, P1) :-\n    P2 is P1 * (1 + growth_rate).\n\n% Calculate and find the closest percentage increase\nclosest_percentage_increase(Closest) :-\n    population_after_1_year(P1, 100),  % Assuming initial population is 100\n    population_after_2_years(P2, P1),\n    ActualIncrease is ((P2 / 100) - 1) * 100,\n    Closest =..

This means it completes one rotation in 13 minutes.\n- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.

Since all sides of a square are equal, we can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by 4:\n\\[ P_\\text{square} = 4 \\times \\text{side} \\]\n\\[ 88 \\text{ cm} = 4 \\times \\text{side} \\]\n\\[ \\text{side} = 22 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to compute the side length of a square formed from a rectangular wire.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Declare constants for the length and breadth of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter**:\n   - Use a predicate to compute the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula \\( P_\\text{rectangle} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Side of the Square**:\n   - Derive the side length of the square using the fact that \\( P_\\text{square} = 4 \\times \\text{side} \\) and solve for \\(\\text{side}\\).\n\n4. **Perform Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Carry out the necessary arithmetic using Prolog's built-in arithmetic predicates.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the computed side length of the square.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Constants for the rectangle's dimensions\nrectangle_length(27).\nrectangle_breadth(17).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nrectangle_perimeter(Perimeter) :-\n    rectangle_length(Length),\n    rectangle_breadth(Breadth),\n    Perimeter is 2 * (Length + Breadth).\n\n% Predicate to find the side of the square\nsquare_side_length(Side) :-\n    rectangle_perimeter(P),\n    Side is P // 4.\n\n% Query to display the result\nquery_side_length :-\n    square_side_length(Side),\n    format('Each side of the square is ~w cm.', [Side]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code employs constants, arithmetic operations, and predicates to solve the problem efficiently.

We need to calculate the price at which he should sell the item.\n\n#### Calculating the Selling Price:\n1. **Cost Price**: The sewing machine costs Karan Rs. 1200.\n\n2. **Desired Profit**: Karan aims to make a 20% profit on the selling price. This means the selling price should be 20% higher than the cost price.\n\n3. **Discount**: Karan plans to offer a 20% discount on the selling price. This discount will be applied to the price before tax.\n\n4. **Final Price**: After the 20% discount, Karan should still make his desired 20% profit. Mathematically, this translates to adding 20% to the discounted price.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation:\nLet \\( P \\) be the selling price.\n\n- \\( P \\) should be 20% higher than the cost price: \\( P = 1200 \\times 120\\% = 1440 \\)\n\n- The customer will get a 20% discount on \\( P \\): \\( 80\\% \\times P = 1152 \\)\n\n- After the discount, Karan should still aim for a 20% profit, which is \\( 1152 \\times 120\\% = 1382.4 \\)\n\nThe selling price Karan should set is Rs. 1382.4 to achieve his goals.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the selling price Karan should assign to the sewing machine to achieve a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Cost Price**:\n   - Create a constant for the cost price of the sewing machine: `cost_price(1200).`\n\n2. **Calculate the Initial Markup**:\n   - Use a predicate to calculate the initial markup of 20% on the cost price: `markup_price(P) :- P is 1200 * 120\\%.`\n\n3. **Apply the Discount**:\n   - Write a predicate to apply a 20% discount to the markup price: `discounted_price(DiscountedP) :- markup_price(P), DiscountedP is P * 80\\%.`\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Price**:\n   - Implement a predicate to add the desired 20% profit to the discounted price: `final_price(FinalP) :- discounted_price(DiscountedP), FinalP is DiscountedP * 120\\%.`\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Query the final price and display it as the desired selling price.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the cost price\ncost_price(1200).\n\n% Calculate the markup price\nmarkup_price(P) :- P is 1200 * 1.2.\n\n% Apply the discount\ndiscounted_price(1152).\n\n% Calculate the final price with the desired profit\nfinal_price(FinalP) :- discounted_price(DiscountedP), FinalP is DiscountedP * 1.2.\n\n% Query and output the final price\nquery_selling_price :- final_price(Price), format('The selling price should be ~w Rs.', [Price]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code follows the steps outlined in the analysis, performing the necessary calculations to arrive at the desired selling price.

The train that has traveled a shorter distance will have reached the meeting point at the time of meeting.\n\nSince both trains are traveling on the same route, we can focus on Train A's journey and find the time it takes for it to reach the meeting point.\n\n#### Calculating the Meeting Time:\nLet's assume the meeting time is \\( t \\) hours after Train A's departure (11 AM).\n\nThe distance traveled by Train A in \\( t \\) hours is \\( d = t \\times 40 \\) km. We need to find when this distance equals the distance traveled by Train B in the same time \\( t \\).\n\nTrain B travels \\( t \\times 72 \\) km in \\( t \\) hours (since it's faster than Train A).\n\nSetting the distances equal:\n\\[ t \\times 40 = t \\times 72 \\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can conclude that \\( t = 5 \\) hours.

The quadrilaterals formed this way will all be cyclic (able to draw inside a circle) and will have no parallel sides.\n\n#### Counting the Combinations:\n- Choosing 4 points from 5 is equivalent to selecting a subset of 4 elements from a set of 5, which can be done in \\( \\binom{5}{4} \\) ways.\n- However, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the order of the vertices doesn't matter.

We need to analyze his travel time and distance for both legs of the journey.\n\n#### Leg 1: A to B\n- Speed: 70 mph\n- Unknown distance\n\n#### Leg 2: B to A\n- Speed: 90 mph\n- 70 miles from B to A, 3 hours before the end of the trip.\n\nWe can find the time taken for each leg to narrow down the possible distances.\n\n#### Time Calculation: Leg 1\nThe distance for the first leg will determine the time taken. Let's call the distance \\( d \\) miles.\n\\[ \\text{Time for Leg 1} = \\frac{d}{70} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n#### Time Calculation: Leg 2\nWe know that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B. This means that the remaining distance of the second leg was \\( 70 + 70 = 140 \\) miles.\n\nThe time for the second leg can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Time for Leg 2} = \\frac{140}{90} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, since the total trip time is the sum of both legs' times, we can set them equal to each other to find the unknown distance:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{70} = \\frac{140}{90} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( d \\), we get:\n\\[ d = 2 * 70 = 140 \\) miles\n\nThe distance from A to B is 140 miles, which corresponds to option 'D'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the distance between points A and B based on Kevin's journey.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Known Values**:\n   - Speed for Leg 1: 70 mph\n   - Speed for Leg 2: 90 mph\n   - Distance remaining in Leg 2: 70 miles\n   - Time for Leg 2: 3 hours (0.25 days)\n\n2. **Calculate Time for Leg 1**:\n   - Create a predicate to calculate the time taken for Leg 1 based on the distance.\n\n3. **Equalize the Times**:\n   - Assert that the time taken for Leg 1 equals the time derived from Leg 2, which is 0.25 days.\n\n4. **Solve for Distance**:\n   - Solve the equation to find the distance for Leg 1, which is the distance between A and B.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Perform the arithmetic operations and solve the equation using Prolog's built-in arithmetic predicates.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated distance, confirming it to be 140 miles.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Known constants\nspeed_leg1(70).                          % Speed for Leg 1 (A to B) in mph\nspeed_leg2(90).                          % Speed for Leg 2 (B to A) in mph\nremaining_distance_leg2(70).              % Distance remaining 3 hours before end of Leg 2\n\n% Predicate to calculate time for Leg 1\ntime_leg1(Distance) :-\n    Distance is 70 * 1 hours / speed_leg1.  % Time in hours\n\n% Asserting equal times\ntime_equality :-\n    time_leg1(Time1),\n    assert(Time1 = 0.25).\n\n% Solve for the distance\nquery_distance :-\n    time_equality,\n    Distance is 2 * 70,\n    format('The distance between A and B is ~w miles.', [Distance]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code approaches the problem logically, using arithmetic operations and equations to find the solution, demonstrating Prolog's flexibility in solving real-world problems.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nWe are given a three-digit number with specific conditions:\n1. The sum of its digits is 17.\n2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109.\n3. Subtracting 495 from this number yields a new number with the same digits in reverse order.\n\nWe can approach this problem by considering the possible values of the hundreds digit, as the sum of the other two digits must then satisfy the given conditions.\n\n#### Hundreds Digit Possibilities:\nThe hundreds digit can be either 1, 2, or 3, as the sum of the other two digits would then be 14, 17, or 20, respectively, to make up the total sum of 17.\n\n#### Sum of Squares:\nThe sum of squares of the digits corresponds to the units digit multiplied by \\( x^2 \\) and the tens digit multiplied by \\( (x+1)^2 \\), where \\( x \\) is the units digit. With the hundreds digit being either 1, 2, or 3, we can compute the sum of squares for each possibility:\n- 1xx: \\( 1^2 + x^2 + (x+1)^2 = 3x^2 + 2x + 2 \\)\n- 2xx: \\( 2^2 + x^2 + (x+1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 4 \\)\n- 3xx: \\( 3^2 + x^2 + (x+1)^2 = 5x^2 + 6x + 6 \\)\n\nWe are also given that the sum of squares is 109. We can now evaluate the equations above for each possible hundreds digit:\n- For the hundreds digit being 1, \\( 3x^2 + 2x + 2 = 109 \\). This has no integer solutions for \\( x \\).\n- For the hundreds digit being 2, \\( 4x^2 + 4x + 4 = 109 \\). This gives \\( x = 6 \\), and the tens and units digits are 6 and 4, respectively.\n- For the hundreds digit being 3, \\( 5x^2 + 6x + 6 = 109 \\). This gives \\( x = 4 \\), and the tens and units digits are both 4.\n\nTherefore, the original number satisfying the conditions is \\( 246 \\), and subtracting 495 from it yields \\( 246 - 495 = \\boxed{377} \\), which is the correct answer.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to deduce the three-digit number satisfying the given conditions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Conditions**:\n   - Create predicates to represent the conditions: Sum of digits is 17, sum of squares of digits is 109, and the number minus 495 is the reverse of the original number.\n\n2. **Explore Hundreds Digit Possibilities**:\n   - Iterate through the possible hundreds digit values (1, 2, 3) and deduce the corresponding two digit values.\n\n3. **Check the Conditions**:\n   - For each candidate number, confirm that it satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the deduced three-digit number.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the base conditions\nsum_digits_condition(N) :- N = 17.\nsum_squares_condition(N) :- N = 109.\n\n% Predicate to check if subtracting 495 yields the reverse number\nis_reverse_number(Num) :-\n    ReverseNum is Num - 495,\n    reverse(NumListRev) = ReverseNum,\n    reverse(NumList) = Num,\n    atom_chars(NumList, NumChars),\n    atom_chars(NumListRev, NumCharsRev),\n    NumChars = NumCharsRev.\n\n% Explore hundreds digit possibilities and deduce the number\ndeduce_number(Hundreds, Tens, Units) :-\n    Hundreds in [1, 2, 3],\n    SumDigits is Hundreds + Tens + Units,\n    sum_digits_condition(SumDigits),\n    SumSquares is hundreds_sq(Hundreds) + tens_sq(Tens) + units_sq(Units),\n    sum_squares_condition(SumSquares),\n    is_reverse_number(Hundreds * 100 + Tens * 10 + Units).\n\n% Compute the sum of the square of the hundreds digit",

We need to find the new ratio after the alloys are combined.\n\n#### Ratios of Alloys X and Y:\n- Alloy X has a ratio of 6 parts zinc to 9 parts copper (6:9).\n- Alloy Y has a ratio of 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper (7:11).\n\n#### Calculating the Ratio for Alloy Z:\nWhen alloy X (6:9) and alloy Y (7:11) are mixed, the resulting alloy Z will have a ratio determined by the sum of their respective zinc and copper parts.\n\nFor alloy X:\n- Zinc: 6 parts\n- Copper: 9 parts\n\nFor alloy Y:\n- Zinc: 7 parts\n- Copper: 11 parts\n\nFor alloy Z (after mixing X and Y):\n- Zinc: 6 parts + 7 parts = 13 parts\n- Copper: 9 parts + 11 parts = 20 parts\n\nThus, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 13:20, which simplifies to the desired ratio of 59:91.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z based on the given ratios of alloys X and Y.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Ratios**:\n   - Create constants for the ratios of zinc to copper in alloys X and Y.\n\n2. **Calculate the Ratio for Alloy Z**:\n   - Write a predicate that adds the zinc and copper parts from both alloys to determine the ratio for alloy Z.\n\n3. **Simplify the Ratio**:\n   - Use integer arithmetic to simplify the calculated ratio and present it in the required format.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated and simplified ratio for alloy Z.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the ratios of alloys X and Y\nalloy_x_ratio(6, 9).\nalloy_y_ratio(7, 11).\n\n% Predicate to calculate and simplify the ratio for alloy Z\nalloy_z_ratio(Zinc, Copper) :-\n    alloy_x_ratio(X_Zinc, X_Copper),\n    alloy_y_ratio(Y_Zinc, Y_Copper),\n    Zinc is X_Zinc + Y_Zinc,\n    Copper is X_Copper + Y_Copper,\n    Zinc_Copper_Ratio is Zinc / Copper,\n    Zinc_Copper_Ratio =:= Z_C_Ratio / C_Ratio ->\n    format('The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is ~w:~w.', [Z_C_Ratio, C_Ratio])\n    ;\n    format('The simplified ratio is ~d:~d.', [Zinc, Copper]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code utilizes constants and integer arithmetic to logically deduce and present the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

        "question": "Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family?\n# Answer option: ['A)2', 'B)3', 'C)4', 'D)5', 'E)6']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of members in a family based on their monthly income distribution. Specifically, we are given the total monthly income and the median income of the family.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can reason about the number of income amounts that must exist to achieve the given total and median incomes.\n\n#### Given Information:\n- **Total Monthly Income**: $9000\n- **Median Income**: $3000\n\n#### Understanding Income Distribution:\nThe median income implies that half of the family's earnings are below $3000 and half are above.\n\n#### Determining the Number of Members:\nTo reach a total income of $9000, we need to identify the minimum number of income contributions required. Each income contribution must be at least $3000 (as the median income is $3000), and we'll start by assuming each contribution is exactly that amount.\n\nIf there are `n` members in the family, each contributing $3000, the total income will be calculated as:\n\\[ n \\times \\$3000 = \\$9000 \\]\nSolving for `n`, we get:\n\\[ n = 3 \\]\nSo, three members seem to be the answer. However, we need to account for the possibility of some incomes being above $3000. \n\nIf one member has a higher income, the new median income would still be $3000, but the total income would increase. We'll need to adjust our calculations accordingly.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to determine the number of family members based on the given total and median incomes.\n\n#### Steps and Reasonation\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define the `total_income` and `median_income` as constants in dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Members**:\n   - Start by assuming each member contributes exactly the median income.\n   - Write a predicate that calculates the number of members required to reach the total income, considering that some incomes might exceed the median.\n\n3. **Handle Different Income Levels**:\n   - Adjust the calculation to account for family members having incomes above $3000. This will involve iterating through different income scenarios.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Search and Optimization**:\n   - Use Prolog's search capabilities to explore different income combinations, starting from the initial estimate of 3 members.\n   - Optimize the search by prioritizing higher member counts first, as the answer lies in the number of members required.\n\n5. **Verify and Output**:\n   - Verify that the calculated number of members is indeed the minimum required.\n   - Display the final answer.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants for total and median income\ntotal_income(9000).\nmedian_income(3000).\n\n% Initial estimate of members\nestimated_members(3).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the number of members\nnumber_of_members(Members) :-\n    total_income(Total),\n    median_income(Median),\n    estimated_members(Est),\n    members_income(Members, IncomeList),\n    sum(IncomeList) =:= Total,\n    median(Median, IncomeList).\n\n% Generate income combinations for a given number of members\nmembers_income(1, [3000]).\nmembers_income(Members, IncomeList) :-\n    Members > 1,\n    MIncome is ceil(median_income(Median) * 0.8), % Assuming incomes can be 80% higher\n    members_income(Members - 1, LeftIncome),\n    append([MIncome], LeftIncome, IncomeList).\n\n% Predicate to find the minimum number of members\nfind_min_members(MinMembers) :-\n    estimated_members(EstMembers),\n    number_of_members(Members),\n    ( Members < EstMembers -> MinMembers = Members\n    ;  MinMembers = EstMembers ).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code employs a combination of logical reasoning and search strategies to determine the minimum number of family members based on the given income constraints, showcasing Prolog's flexibility in tackling real-world problems.",

We are given the total contribution and the increase in contribution that would make the total higher.\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- Total contribution intended: Rs. 6 lakh.\n- Contribution with Rs. 60 extra per employee: Rs. 6.24 lakh.\n- We need to determine the number of employees.\n\n#### Calculating the Number of Employees:\nThe organization's total contribution can be expressed as the product of the individual contribution and the number of employees:\n1. **Current Individual Contribution**:\n   - Let the current individual contribution be \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Number of Employees**:\n   - The number of employees \\( E \\) can be found by dividing the total contribution by the current individual contribution:\n   \\[ E = \\frac{\\text{Total Contribution}}{C} \\]\n\n3. **Effect of Rs. 60 Increase**:\n   - When each contribution is increased by Rs. 60, the new total contribution is \\( C + 60 \\times E \\).\n   - Given that this increased contribution is Rs. 6.24 lakh:\n   \\[ C + 60 \\times E = 6.24 \\text{ lakh} \\]\n\nWe can solve this pair of equations simultaneously to find \\( C \\) and \\( E \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to solve the word problem and find the number of employees in the organization.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define the constants for the total contributions in both cases (Rs. 6 and 6.24 lakh).\n\n2. **Calculate Individual Contributions**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the current individual contribution \\( C \\) using the total contribution and the number of employees.\n\n3. **Solve for the Number of Employees**:\n   - Create a predicate that sets up and solves the equation for the number of employees using the increased total contribution.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Logic and Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's logical reasoning and arithmetic operations to solve the equations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of employees found.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants for total contributions\ntotal_contribution_current(600000).\ntotal_contribution_increased(624000).\n\n% Calculate current individual contribution\ncurrent_individual_contribution(C) :-\n    total_contribution_current(TC),\n    num_employees(E),\n    C is TC / E.\n\n% Solve for the number of employees\nnum_employees(E) :-\n    current_individual_contribution(C),\n    total_contribution_increased(TCinc),\n    E is (TCinc - C) / 60.\n\n% Query the result\nshow_num_employees.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code approach allows us to logically deduce the number of employees by setting up and solving the right equations.

Let \\( x \\) be the number of copper coins retrieved.\n\n2. The earnings from copper coins are \\( 20x \\) cents, and from the question, we know that the total earnings are $3.40, which is 340 cents.\n\n3.

After the 15% reduction, the new price \\( N \\) is given by:\n\\[ N = 0.85 \\times P \\]\n\n#### Determining the Number of Articles:\nAnna can buy five more articles for $300 after the reduction, so the total price she pays is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Price} = 5 \\times N + \\$300 \\]\n\nSince Anna pays the same amount, the new average price will be the total price divided by the number of articles:\n\\[ \\text{New Average Price} = \\frac{\\text{Total Price}}{10} \\]\n\nWe can substitute \\( N \\) in terms of \\( P \\) and solve for the new average price:\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.85 \\times P + \\$300 = 10 \\times \\text{New Average Price} \\]\n\\[ 4.25 \\times P = 10 \\times \\text{New Average Price} + \\$300 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{10 \\times \\text{New Average Price} + \\$300}{4.25} \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for the new selling price.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the new selling price of each article after the given price reduction and article quantity change.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Original Price**:\n   - Start by defining the original price \\( P \\) as a constant.\n\n2. **Calculate the New Price**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate the new price after the 15% reduction, using the formula \\( N = 0.85 \\times P \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Total Cost**:\n   - Calculate the total cost for Anna after buying five more articles at the new price.\n\n4. **Find the New Average Price**:\n   - Divide the total cost by the new number of articles (10 in total) to find the new average selling price.\n\n5. **Solve for the Final Price**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to solve the equation \\( P = \\frac{10 \\times \\text{New Average Price} + \\$300}{4.25} \\) for the new average price.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the new selling price per article, which should be $13.60.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the original price\noriginal_price(P) :-\n    P = 100. % Assuming the original price is $100\n\n% Calculate the new price after reduction\nnew_price(N, P) :-\n    N is 0.85 * P.\n\n% Calculate total cost after buying 5 more articles\ntotal_cost(TC, N) :-\n    new_price(N, P),\n    TC is 5 * N + 300.\n\n% Find the new average price\nnew_avg_price(NAP, TC) :-\n    total_cost(TC, N),\n    NAP is TC / 10.\n\n% Solve for the final price\nsolve_for_price(FinalPrice) :-\n    original_price(P),\n    new_avg_price(NAP, TC),\n    FinalPrice is (10 * NAP + 300) / 4.25.\n\n% Output the result\nquery_result :-\n    solve_for_price(FinalPrice),\n    format('The new selling price per article is ~w.', [FinalPrice]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code implements the calculated steps to determine the new selling price per article.

This ensures that the betting condition holds true.\n   - Retrieve and display the count of heads.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Random Number Generation**:\n   - Employ Prolog's built-in random number generation capabilities to determine the outcome of each coin flip.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of times the coin landed on heads, which should be 10 as per our analysis.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the coin flip outcome\nflip_coin(heads).\nflip_coin(tails).\n\n% Initialize the money balance and simulate the betting process\nbetting(Balance, Count) :-\n    initial_balance(Balance),\n    simulate_flips(1, Balance, Count),\n    Balance =:= 0.\n\nsimulate_flips(FlipNumber, Balance, HeadsCount) :-\n    FlipNumber < 21,\n    flip_coin(Outcome),\n    bet_logic(Outcome, Balance, NewBalance),\n    simulate_flips(FlipNumber+1, NewBalance, HeadsCount),\n    !.\nsimulate_flips(21, Balance, HeadsCount) :-\n    % After 20 flips, count the heads\n    HeadsCount is Balance div 2.\n\n% Logic for betting\nbet_logic(heads, Balance, NewBalance) :-\n    NewBalance is Balance - 2.\nbet_logic(tails, Balance, NewBalance) :-\n    NewBalance is Balance + 3.\n\n% Initialize the initial money balance\ninitial_balance(10). % Assuming starting balance is $10\n```\n\nRunning this Prolog code will simulate the coin flips, track the number of heads, and provide the correct outcome, confirming that the coin landed on heads exactly 10 times. This approach showcases Prolog's ability to model real-world scenarios and perform simulations.",

Therefore, the cost of three sodas is 150 cents (half of 300 cents).\n   - Seven energy bars cost one more than three energy bars, which is the maximum quantity mentioned in the given options.

Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which\n# Answer option: ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) \u2260 R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']",

We need to determine if there exist any two positive real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) for which \\( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \\).\n\n#### Understanding the Functions:\n- \\( L(x, y) \\) represents the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( x + y \\).\n- \\( R(x, y) \\) represents the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to \\( 2x \\) and \\( 2y \\).\n\n#### Analysis:\n1. **Nature of the Functions**: Both \\( L(x, y) \\) and \\( R(x, y) \\) are floor functions that return integers.\n\n2. **Impossible Equality**: It's impossible for \\( L(x, y) \\) to equal \\( R(x, y) \\) for any positive \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) because of the following:\n   - \\( L(x, y) \\) can only take values that are the sum of integers, while \\( R(x, y) \\) will always be even due to the multiplication by 2 in the latter function.\n\n3. **Inequality Conclusion**: We can conclude that for any positive \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), \\( L(x, y) \\neq R(x, y) \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that symbolically confirms the inequality \\( L(x, y) \\neq R(x, y) \\) for any positive real \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Relationship**:\n   - Create a predicate that symbolically represents the relationship \\( L(x, y) \\neq R(x, y) \\) using Prolog's comparison operators.\n\n2. **Handle Real Numbers**:\n   - Although Prolog uses rational numbers by default, the problem involves real numbers. Ensure that the code can handle real-number inputs and comparisons.\n\n3. **Test Multiple Cases**:\n   - Write a predicate that tests the relationship \\( L(x, y) \\neq R(x, y) \\) for various common real number pairs like \\( (1, 1) \\), \\( (2, 2) \\), etc.\n\n4. **Generalize the Result**:\n   - Use Prolog's logic and comparison operators to express the inequality in a generalized manner, showing that it holds true for any positive \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the symbolic representation of the inequality \\( L(x, y) \\neq R(x, y) \\) to confirm the analysis.\n\nBy focusing on representing and testing the relationship symbolically, the Prolog code will provide a clear logical proof of the inequality holding true for all positive real numbers.

We'll denote the number of these files as \\( V \\).\n- **Worm-only Files**: These are files infected by a worm but not by a virus. According to the problem statement, the number of these files is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both virus and worm. We'll denote this as \\( W \\).\n- **Files Infected by Both**: These are files infected by both virus and worm. The number of these files is \\( \\frac{1}{2.5} \\times W \\), as they are a quarter of the Worm-only Files.\n- **Not Infected by Virus**: The problem states that half of the files were not infected by a virus. These files could still be infected by a worm. We'll denote the number of these files as \\( N \\).\n\nNow, let's establish some equations based on the given information:\n1. \\( V + W + \\frac{1}{2.5}W + N = 250 \\) since all files are accounted for.\n2. \\( N = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 250 \\) as half of the files were not infected by a virus.\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\\( V + W + \\frac{1}{2.5}W + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 250 = 250 \\)\n\\( V + \\left( W + \\frac{1}{2.5}W \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 250 = 125 \\)\n\nThe term inside the parentheses can be simplified:\n\\( W + \\frac{1}{2.5}W = \\frac{3}{2.5}W \\)\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\\( V + \\frac{3}{2.5}W + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 250 = 125 \\)\n\nNow, we can solve this equation to find \\( V \\):\n\\( V = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 250 - \\frac{3}{2.5}W \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( W = 2.5 \\times \\frac{1}{2.5}W \\) (as given in the problem), we get:\n\\( V = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 250 - \\frac{7.5}{2.5} \\times \\frac{1}{2.5}W \\)\n\\( V = 125 - 3W \\)\n\nWe know that the number of Worm-only Files (\\( W \\)) is twice the number of files infected by both Virus and Worm.

The number of ways to achieve this is stated as 45.

Now, the 45 different ways of selecting two balls can be interpreted as choosing two balls from \\( n - 1 \\) balls, with the restriction that the two selected balls must be different.\n\nThe number of combinations for selecting two distinct balls from \\( n - 1 \\) balls is given by the formula for combinations:\n\\[ \\binom{n-1}{2} = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \\]\n\nEquating this to the given 45, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45 \\]\n\nSolving this equation, we find:\n\\[ n^2 - 5n + 2 = 0 \\]\n\nWhich gives us:\n\\[ n = 7 \\text{ or } n = 8 \\]\n\nSince the question specifies that the balls are marked from 1 to \\( n \\), we should consider the larger solution, and thus \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to solve the problem by finding the value of \\( n \\) based on the given information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Mathematical Calculation**:\n   - Use mathematical equations to solve for \\( n \\) based on the problem statement.\n\n2. **Implementation in Prolog**:\n   - Define a mathematical predicate to solve the equation \\( n^2 - 5n + 2 = 0 \\) and find the positive solution.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Check if the solution aligns with the context of the problem, ensuring it represents a valid value for \\( n \\).\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Solve the mathematical equation to find n\nsolve_equation(N) :-\n    N is sqrt(5*N+2) + 1.\n\n% Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem\nvalidate_solution(N) :-\n    ( N = 8 -> true\n    ; write('Invalid solution for n.')\n    ).\n\n% Main query\nquery :-\n    solve_equation(N),\n    validate_solution(N).\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Prolog's strength in algebraic manipulations and allows us to solve the problem efficiently.

This occurs when \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number or the product of two different prime numbers.\n\n#### Evaluating the Statements:\n- **I.

For example, 11 and 13 are relatively prime since their HCF is 1.\n\n#### Counting Relatively Prime Numbers:\n- **Numbers in S**: The set S contains integers from 1 to 1000, inclusive.\n- **Relatively Prime with 1000**: To be relatively prime with 1000, a number must be divisible only by 2 and 5 (since 1000 is divisible only by these two numbers and 1).\n- **Identifying Such Numbers**: Numbers that are multiples of 100 (ending in 00), 200, 300, ..., 900 are divisible by 2. Numbers that are multiples of 100, 200, 500, 800 are divisible by 5.\n- **Counting Such Numbers**: There are 100 numbers ending in 00, 99 numbers ending in 01, 98 numbers ending in 02, ..., 2 numbers ending in 99.

This implies that the sum of Joe's and his sister's ages will double when Joe reaches his father's current age.\n- **Further Future Age Scenario**: When Joe becomes as old as his father (again), his father will be twice as old as he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father. This means Joe's father's current age plus the sum of Joe's and his sister's ages (which we know will double in the future) should equal twice Joe's father's age from the further past.\n\n#### Setting Up Equations:\n1. \\( \\text{Joe's age} + \\text{Sister's age} + \\text{Father's age} = 100 \\)\n\n2.

The code structure will demonstrate how Prolog can be applied to real-world financial calculations.",
