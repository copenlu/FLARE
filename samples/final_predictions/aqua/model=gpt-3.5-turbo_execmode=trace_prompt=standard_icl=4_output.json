Additionally, we need to determine how many of the letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Analyzing the Bike Number Format:\n- **Format**: 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n- **Letters**: Assuming the use of the English alphabet, there are 26 possible letters.\n- **Numbers**: Each number can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible values per number position.\n\n#### Calculation of Total Combinations:\n1. **Letter Combinations**: \n   - If both letters need to be distinct, the number of combinations for the first letter is 26, and for the second letter, it is 25 (since it cannot be the same as the first).\n   - Total distinct letter combinations = \\( 26 \\times 25 \\).\n\n2. **Number Combinations**:\n   - Each of the two number positions can be any of 10 digits (0-9).\n   - Total number combinations = \\( 10 \\times 10 \\).\n\n3. **Total Bike Numbers**:\n   - Total combinations = (Total distinct letter combinations) \u00d7 (Total number combinations).\n   - Total combinations = \\( (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 10) = 65000 \\).\n\nFrom this analysis, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 65,000, assuming both letters need to be distinct.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using the specified format and checks how many letters need to be distinct.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants and Parameters**:\n   - Define the total number of letters (26) and the range of numbers (0-9).\n\n2. **Calculate Combinations for Letters**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 distinct letters from the 26 available.\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Numbers**:\n   - Implement a predicate to calculate combinations of 2 numbers where each number can be from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Multiply the results of the two predicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\n5. **Use Prolog's Search and Calculation Capabilities**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the multiplication of combinations.\n   - Implement predicates that handle the generation of combinations and ensure distinctness where required.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n   - Confirm the requirement for the letters to be distinct by checking the calculated total against the expected result (65000).\n\nBy using Prolog's logical and arithmetic capabilities, we can efficiently solve the problem and confirm the conditions regarding the distinctness of letters. This approach leverages Prolog's strengths in handling combinatorial logic and arithmetic operations."

For a square, all sides are equal, so if \\( s \\) is the length of one side:\n\\[ 4s = 88 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{88 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 22 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThus, each side of the square formed by rebending the wire will measure 22 cm.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program that calculates the side of a square formed by rebending a wire that originally formed a rectangle, given the rectangle's dimensions.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Rectangle Dimensions**:\n   - Define constants for the length and breadth of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter**:\n   - Write a predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula \\( P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Side of the Square**:\n   - Using the perimeter calculated, determine the side of the square using the relation \\( 4s = P \\).\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Implement the arithmetic directly in the predicate to compute the side of the square.\n   - Ensure the calculation is done using integer arithmetic to match the expected results (whole numbers).\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated side of the square, ensuring it matches the expected result of 22 cm.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the dimensions of the rectangle\nrectangle_length(27).\nrectangle_breadth(17).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nrectangle_perimeter(Perimeter) :-\n    rectangle_length(Length),\n    rectangle_breadth(Breadth),\n    Perimeter is 2 * (Length + Breadth).\n\n% Predicate to calculate the side of the square\nsquare_side(Side) :-\n    rectangle_perimeter(Perimeter),\n    Side is Perimeter / 4.\n\n% Query to output the result\nquery_square_side :-\n    square_side(Side),\n    format('Each side of the square is ~w cm.', [Side]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code effectively uses basic arithmetic operations and predicates to solve the problem, demonstrating Prolog's capability to handle mathematical calculations and logical reasoning."

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nTo determine the total profit made by the grocery store from selling bags of ice, we need to calculate the profit made from each bag and then find the total profit from selling 500 bags.\n\n#### Given Information:\n- **Selling Price per Bag**: $1.25\n- **Profit Margin**: 20%\n- **Number of Bags Sold**: 500\n\n#### Calculating Profit per Bag:\n1. **Cost Price per Bag**:\n   - The cost price per bag is the selling price divided by \\(1 + \\text{profit margin}\\) (since the profit margin is 20%).\n   - Cost Price per Bag = \\( \\frac{1.25}{1 + 0.20} = \\frac{1.25}{1.20} = 1.04 \\)\n\n2. **Profit per Bag**:\n   - Profit per Bag = Selling Price per Bag - Cost Price per Bag\n   - Profit per Bag = $1.25 - $1.04 = $0.21\n\n#### Calculating Total Profit:\n3. **Total Profit**:\n   - Total Profit = Profit per Bag \u00d7 Number of Bags Sold\n   - Total Profit = $0.21 \u00d7 500 = $105\n\nTherefore, the total profit made by the grocery store from selling 500 bags of ice is $105.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the total profit made by the grocery store from selling bags of ice.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define constants for the selling price per bag, profit margin, and number of bags sold.\n\n2. **Calculate Cost Price per Bag**:\n   - Calculate the cost price per bag using the selling price and profit margin.\n\n3. **Calculate Profit per Bag**:\n   - Determine the profit per bag by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Profit**:\n   - Multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags sold to find the total profit.\n\n5. **Use Prolog Arithmetic**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total profit made by the grocery store from selling bags of ice.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants\nselling_price_per_bag(1.25).\nprofit_margin(0.20).\nnumber_of_bags_sold(500).\n\n% Calculate cost price per bag\ncost_price_per_bag(CostPrice) :-\n    selling_price_per_bag(SellingPrice),\n    profit_margin(ProfitMargin),\n    CostPrice is SellingPrice / (1 + ProfitMargin).\n\n% Calculate profit per bag\nprofit_per_bag(Profit) :-\n    selling_price_per_bag(SellingPrice),\n    cost_price_per_bag(CostPrice),\n    Profit is SellingPrice - CostPrice.\n\n% Calculate total profit\ntotal_profit(TotalProfit) :-\n    profit_per_bag(ProfitPerBag),\n    number_of_bags_sold(NumBags),\n    TotalProfit is ProfitPerBag * NumBags.\n\n% Query to output the total profit\nquery_total_profit :-\n    total_profit(TotalProfit),\n    format('The total profit from selling 500 bags of ice is $~2f.', [TotalProfit]).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code structure effectively calculates the total profit made by the grocery store from selling bags of ice, showcasing Prolog's arithmetic capabilities and logical reasoning.",
