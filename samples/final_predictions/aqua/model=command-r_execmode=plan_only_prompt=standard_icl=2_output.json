The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(\u221a3 + 1)', 'B)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)', 'C)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)', 'D)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)', 'E)None of these']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to analyze the relationship between the angle of elevation and the time taken.\n\n#### Given:\n- The angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes while approaching the tower.\n\n#### To Find:\nWe seek the additional time required for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n#### Understanding the Situation:\n- The change in angle of elevation implies a change in the relative positions of the car and the tower's base.\n- We can relate the time taken to the change in angle using trigonometry.\n\n#### Plan for Trigonometric Analysis:\n\n1. Let's denote the distance from the car to the base of the tower at the start as `d`.\n2. The change in angle from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 can be related to the change in horizontal distance `d` and time `T` using trigonometry.\n   - Tan(45\u00b0) = opposite side / adjacent side => opposite side = adjacent side * tan(45\u00b0) = d/2\n   - Tan(60\u00b0) = opposite side / hypotenuse => d/\u221a3 = (d/2)/T (for the change in horizontal distance)\n\n3. From the right-angle triangle formed, we can find the relationship:\n   \\[ \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{d}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{T} \\]\n\n4. Simplifying and solving for `T`, we get:\n   \\[ T = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 13.33 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThis analysis indicates that it will take approximately 13.33 minutes more for the car to reach the base of the tower. However, the answer choices seem to be given in whole numbers. We can adjust the value accordingly. Option 'C' is the closest reasonable approximation, making it the correct answer.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\nGiven the mathematical analysis, the focus should be on performing the required trigonometric calculations and conversions using Prolog's arithmetic and logical capabilities.\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Known Values**:\n   - Set the initial angle as `Angle1` (45\u00b0), the final angle as `Angle2` (60\u00b0), and the initial time as `Time1` (10 minutes).\n\n2. **Trigonometric Calculations**:\n   - Use Prolog's trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`) to compute the required trigonometric ratios.\n\n3. **Calculate the Change in Time**:\n   - Based on the trigonometric relationships, calculate the change in time required.\n\n4. **Add Time and Output Result**:\n   - Add the initial time (`Time1`) to the change in time and display the total time taken.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the time taken\ntime_to_reach(Time) :-\n    Angle1 = 45,\n    Angle2 = 60,\n    Time1 = 10,\n    % Perform trigonometric calculations and find the change in time\n    ChangeTime is (2/3) * 10 / sqrt(3),\n    % Add initial time and change in time\n    Time is Time1 + ChangeTime.\n```\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog code will assist in solving the problem by analyzing the given angle changes and calculating the time required accurately.",

Here's how we can approach this:\n\n#### Understanding the Problem:\n- We are looking for five odd numbers that are consecutive, meaning they differ by 2.\n- The sum of five consecutive odd numbers follows a pattern: \\( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 \\), which is a square.\n- The sequence starts with an odd number, let's say \\( x \\), so the numbers in the sequence will be \\( x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8 \\).\n\n#### Identifying the Pattern:\n- If we divide the sum by 10, we notice that the units digit of the resulting sum is always 5.\n- The tens digit of the resulting sum depends on the value of \\( x \\mod 10 \\).\n- When the sum's value is divided by 10, we aim to find a square number.\n\n#### Planning the Prolog Code:\n- We'll need to iterate through the possible values of \\( x \\) to find the desired sequence.\n- We can use modulo to check that the tens digit of the divided sum matches the required pattern.\n- Checking if the divided sum is a square number can be done using mathematical identities in Prolog.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to find the odd numbers whose sum, divided by 10, is a perfect square.\n\n#### Steps and Reasonation\n\n1. **Initialize the Sequence**:\n   - Start with an odd number, \\( x \\), as the base of the sequence.\n\n2. **Generate the Sequence**:\n   - Use a loop to generate the sequence of odd numbers using \\( x, x+2, x+4, \\ldots \\) iteration.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum and Divide**:\n   - Compute the sum of these five numbers.\n   - Divide the sum by 10 to extract the digits as described in the problem.\n\n4. **Check the Tens Digit**:\n   - Use the modulo operation to check if the tens digit of the divided sum matches the pattern (i.e., \\( 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 \\)).\n\n5. **Check for Perfect Square**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to check if the units digit of the divided sum squared matches the remainder of the divided sum.\n\n6. **Output the Odd Number**:\n   - When a valid number is found, display it as one of the five numbers.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Initialize the sequence\nodd_sequence(x, [x]).\n\n% Generate the sequence of odd numbers\nodd_sequence(X, [X | Tail]) :-\n    Next is X + 2,\n    odd_sequence(Next, Tail).\n\n% Calculate the sum and divide by 10\nsum_divided_by_10(X, Digits) :-\n    Sequence = [X, X+2, X+4, X+6, X+8],\n    Sum is sum(Sequence),\n    Digits is trunc(Sum / 10).\n\n% Check the tens digit\nvalid_tens_digit(X) :-\n    sum_divided_by_10(X, Digits),\n    ( Digits mod 10 == 0 -> true ; Digits mod 10 == 2 ).\n\n% Check for perfect square\nis_perfect_square(X) :-\n    sum_divided_by_10(X, Units),\n    square(Units) =:= trunc(Sum/10) , where Sum is X + 2*Units.\n\n% Find and display the odd number\nfind_odd_number(Number) :-\n    odd_sequence(X, _),\n    valid_tens_digit(X),\n    is_perfect_square(X),\n    Number = X.\n```\n\nThis Prolog code should iterate through the odd numbers, checking them against the problem's requirements.

From the area of a triangle, we can express:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\text{Area} = \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\n2. For a triangle formed from the diagonal cut, let's assume the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed after the cut is \\( c \\) and the adjacent side is \\( a \\). We can write:\n\\[ \\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\n#### Plan for Calculating Perimeter:\n1. **Solve for Triangle Dimensions**:\n   - Set up equations using the given information.\n   - Solve for the length of the trimmed edge (which is now the base of the triangles) and the height of the triangles.\n\n2. **Calculate Perimeter**:\n   - Once we have the dimensions of the triangles, we can find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n   - Perimeter = 2 \u00d7 (Trimmed edge length + Length of a triangle side).\n\n3. **Analyze the Result**:\n   - Confirm that the calculated perimeter matches the expected value.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n1. **Define Variables and Constants**:\n   - Define the area of each triangle as a fact in Prolog.\n   - Use logical variables for the trimmed edge length and other relevant dimensions.\n\n2. **Calculate Triangle Dimensions**:\n   - Write predicates to solve for the trimmed edge length and triangle side lengths using the area formula and right triangle properties.\n\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - Implement a predicate that calculates the perimeter of the original square cloth using the dimensions obtained in the previous step.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Operations**:\n   - Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities to perform the calculations accurately.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the calculated perimeter and verify that it matches the expected outcome.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog code will be able to solve the problem step by step, ultimately providing the correct perimeter of the original square cloth.",

This will help us determine the time when they synchronize.\n\n2. **LCM of Rotations**: The LCM of 2 and 5 is 10. Therefore, we need to find the time it takes for both balls to make 10 complete rotations.\n\n3. **Time for 10 Rotations**:\n   - For Ball A: \\( \\text{Time for 10 rotations} = \\text{Time for 2 rotations} \\times \\frac{10}{2} = 13\\frac{1}{2} \\) minutes.\n   - For Ball B: \\( \\text{Time for 10 rotations} = \\text{Time for 5 rotations} \\times \\frac{10}{5} = 7\\frac{0}{5} \\) minutes.\n\n4. **Synchronizing Time**: Both balls need to take the same time to complete 10 rotations.

For instance:\n     ```prolog\n     ball_a(2, 26).\n     ball_b(5, 35).\n     ```\n\n2. **Calculate LCM**:\n   - Write a predicate that takes two numbers (the number of rotations) and returns their LCM. Use a recursive approach, checking for divisibility and incrementing the count until finding the LCM.\n\n3. **Time for LCM Rotations**:\n   - Compute the time required for each ball to make the LCM number of rotations by multiplying the original time by the LCM divided by the initial number of rotations.\n\n4. **Determine Synchronization Time**:\n   - Find the common time required for both balls to reach the LCM rotation count. This involves comparing and equating the times from step 3.\n\n5. **Display Result**:\n   - Present the synchronization time in a human-readable format, such as \"2 hour(s) and 31 minute(s)\".\n\nBy breaking down the problem into these steps, the SWI-Prolog code will logically progress toward the solution, eventually providing the correct answer.",

This will give us the month when C joined the business.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate the number of months it took for C to join the business based on the given financial details.\n\n#### Steps and Reasonization\n\n1. **Define Facts**:\n   - Define the initial investment by A as a fact in Prolog.\n\n2. **Calculate Investment after B Joins**:\n   - Write a predicate to add B's investment to the initial investment.\n\n3. **Determine C's Investment Month**:\n   - Create a predicate that calculates the number of months required to accumulate half of C's share profit, given the investment amount at that time.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Profit**:\n   - Write a predicate to compute the total profit made during the year.\n\n5. **Relate Profit to Months**:\n   - Find the profit made before C's entry by subtracting half of C's share from the total annual profit.\n   - Use another predicate to match this profit against the months it represents.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the number of months it took for C to join after B.\n\nBy following this plan, the Prolog code will logically break down the problem, making it a clear and concise implementation.",

If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\n# Answer option: ['A)368', 'B)377', 'C)288', 'D)997', 'E)112']",
        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nWe are given a few clues about the mysterious three-digit number:\n1. The sum of its digits is 17.\n2. The sum of their squares is 109.\n3. Subtracting 495 from the number yields a number with the same digits in reverse order.\n\nWe can approach this problem by systematically analyzing these clues and deducing the possible values for the number.\n\n#### Clue 1: Sum of Digits is 17\nThis clue suggests that we're dealing with a three-digit number where the individual digits sum up to 17. The possible digits could be: 9 and 8, 8 and 8, 7 and 10, 6 and 11, and so on.\n\n#### Clue 2: Sum of Squares is 109\nThe sum of the squares of the digits further restricts our possibilities. We'll need to compute the squares of potential digits and sum them to match the given value of 109.\n\n#### Clue 3: Reversal and Subtraction\nThe third clue indicates that subtracting 495 from the number yields a new number with the same digits in reverse order. This action doesn't change the values of the individual digits, only their arrangement. We can infer that the difference between the original and reversed numbers is 495.\n\n### Deducing the Number\n\nStarting with the first clue, we can enumerate the possible three-digit numbers whose digits sum to 17. Then, we'll filter these possibilities based on the second clue about the sum of squares. Finally, we'll apply the third clue to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to find the three-digit number that satisfies the given clues.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Explore Possible Digits**:\n   - Given the sum of digits is 17, create a list of potential three-digit numbers. This can be done by iterating through possible combinations of digits (0-9) and summing them.\n\n2. **Filter by Sum of Squares**:\n   - Calculate the sum of the squares of the digits for each potential number and retain only those that match the given sum of 109.\n\n3. **Account for Reversal and Subtraction**:\n   - Subtract 495 from each filtered number and reverse the order of its digits.\n   - Check if the resulting number matches the original one; if so, it's the number we seek.\n\n4. **Use Prolog's Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's built-in predicates for number manipulation, such as `//` for integer division, `mod` for modulus, and list manipulation functions.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the final number, ensuring it aligns with the described properties.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define a predicate to check if a number meets the criteria\nmysterious_number(N) :-\n    % Extract individual digits\n    Digits = [A, B, C],\n    % Calculate sum of digits\n    SumDigits is A + B + C,\n    % Calculate sum of squares of digits\n    SumSquares is A^2 + B^2 + C^2,\n    % Check if it satisfies both sums\n    (SumDigits = 17, SumSquares = 109) ->\n        % Reverse the digits and subtract 495\n        ReversedDigits = [C, B, A],\n        NewNumber is N - 495,\n        NewNumberReversed is digits(NewNumber) ->\n            write(NewNumber).\n\n% Helper predicate to convert a number to digits\ndigits(N) :-\n    Digits = [D1, D2, D3],\n    N = 100*D1 + 10*D2 + D3.\n```\n\nBy walking through these steps, the Prolog code will deduce the number that satisfies all the given clues, showcasing Prolog's ability to handle mathematical puzzles.",

        "plan": "### Explanation and Analysis\n\nThe problem involves calculating the interest accrued on a bond with a given annual interest rate, compounded every six months, over a one-year period. We'll break down the problem to understand the calculations involved.\n\nThe annual interest rate is 12%, which means that the interest for the full year will be 12% of the principal amount, i.e., $600 ($5,000 * 12%). However, the bond also compounds the interest every six months. This means we need to calculate the interest accrued after the first six months, add it to the principal, and then calculate the interest for the second six-month period.\n\n#### First Six Months:\n- Interest accrued: 6% of $5,000 = $300\n- New principal after first six months: $5,000 + $300 = $5,300\n\n#### Second Six Months:\n- Interest accrued: 6% of $5,300 = $318\n\nTherefore, the total interest accrued on the bond at maturity is the sum of these two interest payments, which is $300 + $318 = $618. The correct answer is option B, $618.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nCreate a Prolog program to calculate the interest accrued on a bond with given parameters, mimicking the compounding effect.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define the Bond Parameters**:\n   - Define a predicate to accept the principal amount (`Amount`) and the annual interest rate (`Rate`) as input.\n\n2. **Calculate First Six Months' Interest**:\n   - Compute the interest for the first six months as \\( \\text{Rate} / 2 \\) of the `Amount`.\n\n3. **Update Principal for Second Period**:\n   - Add the first-period interest to the original principal to get the new principal for the second period.\n\n4. **Calculate Second Six Months' Interest**:\n   - Compute the interest for the second six months as \\( \\text{Rate} / 2 \\) of the updated principal.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Interest**:\n   - Sum the interests from both periods to find the total interest accrued.\n\n6. **Use Prolog's Arithmetic Capabilities**:\n   - Utilize Prolog's arithmetic predicates to perform the calculations, especially the division (`//`) and concatenation (`+`) operations.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Display the total interest accrued on the bond after one year.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define the predicate to calculate the total interest accrued\ntotal_interest(Amount, Rate, Total) :-\n    FirstInterest is Rate // 2 * Amount, % Interest for first 6 months\n    NewAmount is Amount + FirstInterest, % Updated principal\n    SecondInterest is Rate // 2 * NewAmount, % Interest for second 6 months\n    Total is FirstInterest + SecondInterest. % Total interest\n```\n\nThis Prolog code captures the step-by-step calculation involved in determining the interest accrued on the bond.

We must convert these minutes to hours to aggregate the rest time.\n- 10 minutes is \\( \\frac{10}{60} \\) of an hour.\n- With a rest after every 15 km, the total rest time will be the number of 15 km segments in 100 km.\n- 100 km / 15 km = 6.67 segments (rounded up to 7 due to the rest after completing the 100 km).\n- Rest time: 7 segments * \\( \\frac{10}{60} \\) hours = 0.33 hours or 20 minutes.\n\n#### Total Time:\n- Total time = Riding time + Rest time = 10 hours + 0.33 hours.\n- Given that we cannot have a third of an hour, we round up the total time to the nearest hour.\n- Therefore, Shweta will take 11 hours to cover 100 km.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nDevelop a Prolog program to calculate the total time Shweta will take to cover 100 km with regular rest stops.\n\n#### Steps and Reasonation\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Set the riding rate (distance/time) and the rest time (in minutes) as constants.\n\n2. **Calculate Riding Time**:\n   - Determine the riding time by dividing the required distance (100 km) by the riding rate (10 km/hr).\n\n3. **Convert Rest Time to Hours**:\n   - Write a predicate to convert the rest time in minutes to hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Rest Stops**:\n   - Determine the number of 15 km segments in 100 km.

This can be approached by considering the principles of modular arithmetic and the patterns of powers ending in 9.\n\n#### Analyzing \\( 9^3 \\):\nThe units digit of 9^3 can be found by observing that \\( 9 \\equiv 0 \\mod{10} \\) and applying the power rule for modular arithmetic:\n\\[ 9^3 \\equiv 0^3 \\mod{10} \\]\n\\[ \\equiv 0 \\mod{10} \\]\nSo, the units digit of 9^3 is 0.\n\n#### Analyzing \\( 9^3 - 7 \\):\nSubtracting 7 from \\( 9^3 \\) doesn't change the units digit.

Understanding that the sum of the digits of \\( N \\) is the focus of the problem, we can approach it as follows:\n\n1. The remainder of 2272 divided by \\( N \\) matches the remainder of 875 divided by \\( N \\). This implies that \\( \\text{rem}(2272, N) = \\text{rem}(875, N) \\).\n\n2. We can compute the remainders of both divisions and equate them to find common patterns or values.\n\n3. It's useful to note that 2272 and 875 have different digits, so the remainder of their divisions by \\( N \\) will depend on the last two digits of \\( N \\), as the hundreds and tens places will contribute to the tens and units place of the remainder, respectively.\n\n4.

Let's analyze each statement:\n\n- **I: Q is the square of a prime number**: If Q is the square of a prime number, it will indeed have 5 factors: the prime number itself, its square (Q), and three multiples of that prime number. For example, 9 is the square of 3, and it has 5 factors: 1, 3, 9, 3x3, and 9x3.\n- **II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number**: Q being the fourth power of a prime number doesn't guarantee that it has 5 factors. Consider 13^4 = 28561, which has 8 factors (1, 13, 28561, 13^2, 13^3, 28561/13, 28561/13^2, 28561/13^3).\n- **III: Q is the product of two prime numbers**: When Q is the product of two prime numbers, it generally has four factors: the two prime factors and their product (Q). However, in some cases, it can have more than four factors. For instance, 6 = 2x3 has five factors: 1, 2, 3, 6, and 6x3.\n\nWe can conclude that Q being the square of a prime number is a necessary condition for it to have 5 factors.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to verify if a given positive integer Q is the square of a prime number.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define a Predicate**:\n   - Create a predicate `is_square_of_prime(Q)` that determines if Q is the square of a prime number.\n\n2. **Check for Prime Numbers**:\n   - Use a helper predicate `is_prime(N)` to check if a number N is a prime number. This predicate should use a basic primality testing algorithm.\n\n3. **Square Checking**:\n   - In the `is_square_of_prime(Q)` predicate, check if Q is the square of an integer and then verify if that integer is a prime number using the `is_prime` helper predicate.\n\n4. **Base Cases and Logic**:\n   - Ensure the code handles base cases, such as checking for positive integers.\n   - Use Prolog's built-in arithmetic capabilities to perform calculations.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Depending on whether Q is the square of a prime, output 'I only' or 'false'.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Helper predicate to check if a number is prime\nis_prime(N) :-\n    N > 1,\n    % Basic primality test\n    (   N = 2\n    ;   N = 3\n    ;   N mod 2 =\\= 0\n    ;   N mod 3 =\\= 0\n    ;   N =:= 4\n    ;   N =:= 6\n    ;   N mod 5 =\\= 0\n    ;   N > 6, N mod 2 = 0; N mod 3 = 0\n    ).\n\n% Predicate to check if Q is the square of a prime\nis_square_of_prime(Q) :-\n    % Check if Q is a square\n    X is sqrt(Q),\n    % Check if X is a prime number\n    is_prime(X).\n\n% Main query\n?- is_square_of_prime(Q), write('I only'). ; write('false').\n```\n\nThis Prolog code uses a primality testing algorithm and square root extraction to determine if Q satisfies condition I.

Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate, so she can clean the yacht in 24 times the time it takes Jack (since 5% x 12 hours = 0.5 x 12 hours = 6 hours).

We are given the total amount received at the end of the year, including interest, and the interest rate of 8% compounded semi-annually.\n\n#### Breakdown of the Problem:\n- **Total Amount Received**: $54,080\n- **Annual Interest Rate**: 8% compounded semi-annually\n\n#### Understanding Compounded Interest\n\n8% compounded semi-annually implies that the interest is calculated twice a year, with each period earning 4% interest.\n\n#### Calculating the Original Investment\nWe can express the total amount received as the sum of the interest and the original principal amount. To solve for the principal, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\\[ A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} - P \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the total amount received (\\$54,080).\n- \\( P \\) is the original principal amount (what we seek to find).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (8% or 0.08).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (2, as it's semi-annual).\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years (1).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ \\$54,080 = P\\left(1 + \\frac{0.08}{2}\\right)^{2 \\times 1} - P \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression will help us solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[ \\$54,080 = P\\left(1.04\\right)^{2} - P \\]\n\\[ 0 = P\\left(1.04\\right)^{2} - \\$54,080 - P \\]\n\\[ P\\left(1.04^2 + 1\\right) = \\$54,080 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\$54,080}{1.04^2 + 1} \\approx \\$50,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original amount Charles invested was $50,000, which corresponds to option 'B'.\n\n### Plan for Writing SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Aim\nWrite a Prolog program to calculate the original investment amount based on the provided information.\n\n#### Steps and Reasoning\n\n1. **Define Constants**:\n   - Define constants for the `total_amount` received and the `annual_interest_rate`.\n\n2. **Understand Compounded Interest**:\n   - Recognize that the annual interest rate being compounded semi-annually means calculating interest twice a year.\n\n3. **Calculate Original Investment**:\n   - Use the compound interest formula to solve for the original principal amount:\n     \\[ P = \\frac{\\text{total\\_amount}}{(1 + \\frac{\\text{annual\\_interest\\_rate}}{2})^4 - 1} \\]\n\n4. **Implement in Prolog**:\n   - Create a predicate `calculate_original_investment` to perform the calculation and return the original investment amount.\n\n5. **Execute and Display**:\n   - Call the predicate with the given `total_amount` and `annual_interest_rate` to obtain the solution.\n\n#### Prolog Code Structure\n```prolog\n% Define constants for the problem\ntotal_amount(54080).\nannual_interest_rate(0.08).  % 8% annual interest\n\n% Calculate original investment using compound interest formula\ncalculate_original_investment(OriginalInvestment) :-\n    total_amount(Total),\n    annual_interest_rate(Rate),\n    OriginalInvestment is Total / ((1 + Rate/2)^4 - 1).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code utilizes the provided constants and the compound interest formula to efficiently calculate and return the original investment amount.",

This means that in one minute, P can eat \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of the jar.\n\n2. **Q's Eating Rate**:\n   - Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes.
