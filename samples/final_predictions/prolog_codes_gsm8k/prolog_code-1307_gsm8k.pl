% Define the rule for calculating the total force required to push the car
total_force(CarWeight, LuggageWeight, ChildrenWeight, ForcePercentage, TotalForce) :-
% Calculate the total weight by summing the weights of the car, luggage, and children
TotalWeight is CarWeight + LuggageWeight + (2 * ChildrenWeight),
% Calculate the force required to move the total weight (1% of the total weight)
TotalForce is TotalWeight * ForcePercentage / 100.
% Define a predicate to execute the specific query with given values
query(TotalForce) :-
% Car weight: 1200 pounds, luggage weight: 250 pounds, children weight: 75 pounds each, force percentage: 1%
total_force(1200, 250, 75, 1, TotalForce).
% Uncomment the line below to run the query
% ?- query(TotalForce).
%query(TotalForce).
