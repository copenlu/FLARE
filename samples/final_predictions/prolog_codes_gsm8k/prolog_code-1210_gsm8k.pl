% Define the variables for Colin's current age (C) and Wendy's current age (W)
% Assumed atom: C represents Colin's current age, W represents Wendy's current age
% Assumed predicate: is_age_relation(C, W) represents the relationship between Colin's and Wendy's ages
% Assumed predicate: is_age_ratio(C, W) represents the age ratio between Colin and Wendy
% Assumed predicate: is_future_age(C, W) represents the future age relationship between Colin and Wendy
% Define the relationship between Colin's and Wendy's ages
is_age_relation(C, W) :-
W is 5 * (C + 7).
% Define the age ratio between Colin and Wendy
is_age_ratio(C, W) :-
W is 3 * C.
% Define the future age relationship between Colin and Wendy
is_future_age(C, W) :-
C1 is C + 25,
W1 is W + 25,
C1 is W1 / 3.
% Main predicate to find Colin's current age
find_colins_age(C) :-
% Use is_age_relation to set up the relationship equation
is_age_relation(C, W),
% Use is_age_ratio to set up the age ratio equation
is_age_ratio(C, W),
% Use is_future_age to set up the future age relationship equation
is_future_age(C, W).
% Query predicate to get Colin's current age
query(ColinAge) :-
find_colins_age(ColinAge).
% Uncomment the following line to run the query
% ?- query(ColinAge).
%query(ColinAge).
