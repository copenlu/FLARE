% Define the relationships between the rope lengths
% Assumed atom: red_length, blue_length, yellow_length
% Formulate equations based on the relationships
% Red rope is four times the length of the blue rope
red_length(RedLength, BlueLength) :-
RedLength is 4 * BlueLength.
% Blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope
blue_length(BlueLength, YellowLength) :-
BlueLength is YellowLength - 7.
% Total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters
total_length(RedLength, BlueLength, YellowLength) :-
RedLength + BlueLength + YellowLength =:= 37.
% Main predicate to calculate the length of the red rope
calculate_red_length(RedLength) :-
% Define the yellow rope length
YellowLength = 2,  % Assumed atom: yellow_length
% Calculate the length of the blue rope
blue_length(BlueLength, YellowLength),
% Calculate the length of the red rope
red_length(RedLength, BlueLength).
% Query predicate to get the length of the red rope
query(RedLength) :-
calculate_red_length(RedLength).
% Uncomment the following line to run the query
% query(RedLength).
