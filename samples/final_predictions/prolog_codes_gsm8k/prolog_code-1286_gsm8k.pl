% Define the rules to calculate water needed for each category of plants
water_needed_half_cup(Plants, Water) :- Water is Plants * 0.5.
water_needed_1_cup(Plants, Water) :- Water is Plants * 1.
water_needed_quarter_cup(Plants, Water) :- Water is Plants * 0.25.
% Define the rule to calculate total water needed
total_water_needed(TotalWater) :-
water_needed_half_cup(4, Water1),           % Calculate water needed for 4 plants requiring half a cup
water_needed_1_cup(8, Water2),              % Calculate water needed for 8 plants requiring 1 cup
RemainingPlants is 20 - 4 - 8,              % Calculate the number of plants needing a quarter cup
water_needed_quarter_cup(RemainingPlants, Water3),  % Calculate water needed for remaining plants
TotalWater is Water1 + Water2 + Water3.     % Calculate total water needed
% Query to find the total water needed
query(TotalWater) :-
total_water_needed(TotalWater).
% Uncomment the following line to run the query
% ?- query(TotalWater).
