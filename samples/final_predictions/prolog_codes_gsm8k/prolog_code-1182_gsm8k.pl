% Define the relationship between the number of seashells collected by Carrey, Carlos, and Jim
% Assumed atom/predicate: seashells_collected(Carrey, Carlos, Jim)
seashells_collected(Carrey, Carlos, Jim) :-
Carlos is 2 * Carrey,  % Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey
Jim is Carlos + 5,     % Jim collected 5 more than Carlos
% Total number of seashells collected by all three
Total is Carrey + Carlos + Jim,
Total mod 3 =:= 0.     % Ensure the total is divisible by 3 for equal distribution
% Calculate the number of seashells collected by Carlos
% Assumed atom/predicate: carlos_seashells(Carlos, Carrey)
carlos_seashells(Carlos, Carrey) :-
Carlos is 2 * Carrey.
% Calculate the number of seashells collected by Jim
% Assumed atom/predicate: jim_seashells(Jim, Carlos)
jim_seashells(Jim, Carlos) :-
Jim is Carlos + 5.
% Calculate the total number of seashells collected
% Assumed atom/predicate: total_seashells(Total)
total_seashells(Total) :-
seashells_collected(Carrey, Carlos, Jim),
Total is Carrey + Carlos + Jim.
% Calculate the number of seashells each person received
% Assumed atom/predicate: seashells_per_person(Seashells)
seashells_per_person(Seashells) :-
total_seashells(Total),
Seashells is Total // 3.  % Divide total seashells equally among 3 persons
% Query predicate to get the number of seashells each person received
