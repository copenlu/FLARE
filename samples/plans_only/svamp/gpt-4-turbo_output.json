Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a rule `plant_trees`**: This rule will take three arguments - `InitialTrees`, `FinalTrees`, and `PlantedTrees`.\n2. **Arithmetic operation**: Use Prolog's arithmetic capabilities (`is` keyword) to calculate the difference between `FinalTrees` and `InitialTrees`, which gives `PlantedTrees`.\n3. **Query using Prolog**: We will write a query that uses this rule to find out the number of trees planted given the initial and final counts.\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the number of trees planted\nplant_trees(InitialTrees, FinalTrees, PlantedTrees) :-\n    PlantedTrees is FinalTrees - InitialTrees.\n\n% Example query to find out how many trees were planted today\n% Given initial trees as 15 and final trees as 21\n?- plant_trees(15, 21, PlantedTrees).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines a straightforward relationship between the initial and final tree counts and computes the number of trees planted.

Initially, there were 9 computers. Each day, from Monday to Thursday, 5 more computers were added. The goal is to determine the total count of computers by the end of Thursday.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of arithmetic calculations:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Start with the known number of computers, which is 9.\n2. **Daily Installation**: Each day, 5 computers are added.\n3. **Number of Days**: Computers were added for 4 consecutive days (Monday to Thursday).\n4. **Total Computers Added**: Multiply the number of computers added daily by the number of days (4 days).\n5. **Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to get the final number of computers.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo implement this in SWI-Prolog, we will define a rule that calculates the final number of computers based on the initial count, the number of days, and the number of computers added each day. Here's how we can structure the Prolog code:\n\n1. **Define a Rule**: Create a rule `total_computers` that accepts four parameters: `InitialComputers`, `Days`, `ComputersPerDay`, and `FinalComputers`.\n2. **Calculate Total Added**: Inside the rule, calculate the total number of computers added over the days as the product of `Days` and `ComputersPerDay`.\n3. **Calculate Final Count**: Add the total computers added to the initial count to derive the final count.\n4. **Query Using Prolog**: Use Prolog's querying capabilities to determine the final number of computers by providing the initial conditions (initial count, number of days, and computers added per day).\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the rule to calculate the final number of computers in the server room\ntotal_computers(InitialComputers, Days, ComputersPerDay, FinalComputers) :-\n    TotalAdded is Days * ComputersPerDay,\n    FinalComputers is InitialComputers + TotalAdded.\n\n% Example query to find out the total number of computers now in the server room\n% Given initial computers as 9, days as 4, and computers installed per day as 5\n?- total_computers(9, 4, 5, FinalComputers).\n```\n\nThis Prolog code snippet defines the relationship between the initial conditions and the final outcome. By executing the query, Prolog will compute the final number of computers in the server room based on the provided data."
