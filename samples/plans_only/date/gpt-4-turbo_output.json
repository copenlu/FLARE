Thanksgiving in the US is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, this date was November 22, 2001. Therefore, one month before this date would be October 22, 2001, which can be represented as 10/22/2001 in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date exactly one month prior to a given date. This involves understanding the specific rules for calculating dates based on the US Thanksgiving holiday and then performing a simple month subtraction, taking care to adjust the year if necessary (e.g., if the month is January). In Prolog, we can use date manipulation functions and rules to achieve this.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates.\n   - Ensure the structure can handle operations like month subtraction.\n\n2. **Thanksgiving Date Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the date of Thanksgiving for a given year. This involves finding the fourth Thursday of November. Use date manipulation functions to find the first day of November of the given year, then calculate the first Thursday, and finally add three weeks to get the fourth Thursday.\n\n3. **Month Subtraction Logic:**\n   - Write a rule to subtract one month from a given date. If the month is January, decrement the year by one and set the month to December. Otherwise, simply decrement the month.\n\n4. **Handling Day Overflow:**\n   - Ensure that the day component remains consistent when subtracting a month. If the resulting month has fewer days than the starting day (e.g., moving from March 31 to February), adjust the day to the maximum for that month.\n\n5. **Recursive and Search Logic:**\n   - Use recursive rules to handle the calculation of Thanksgiving and the month subtraction. Prolog\u2019s search capabilities will help in matching the correct rules based on the input year and handling exceptions like leap years.\n\n6. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include a leap year check to correctly handle February in leap years when subtracting months or calculating dates.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases for different years to ensure the Thanksgiving date is calculated correctly and the month subtraction handles all scenarios, including end-of-year transitions and leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the date one month before Thanksgiving for any given year, handling various date transitions and special cases effectively."

Since December 31 is the last day of the year, subtracting seven days means we need to go back into the previous month, December, and find the date that corresponds to seven days before December 31.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to handle the transition from one month to another and potentially from one year to another when subtracting days. This requires understanding the number of days in each month and adjusting the month and year accordingly when crossing these boundaries. In Prolog, we can use recursive rules and pattern matching to manage these transitions effectively.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date Representation:**\n   - Use a structure such as `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` to represent dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n   - Ensure that the structure can manage decrements in days, months, and years.\n\n2. **Handling Day Subtraction:**\n   - Write a rule that subtracts a day from the date, considering the transition between months. For example, if `DD` is 1, the previous day should be the last day of the previous month, and `MM` should decrement.\n\n3. **Month and Year Transitions:**\n   - Implement logic to handle the transition from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year when subtracting days. This involves decrementing the year if the month is January and the day subtraction reaches into the previous year.\n\n4. **Recursive Day Subtraction:**\n   - Develop a recursive rule to subtract multiple days (in this case, seven days). This rule should repeatedly apply the single-day subtraction rule until the total number of days has been subtracted.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Include logic to check for leap years to correctly handle the number of days in February when subtracting days that cross into February.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s search and pattern matching to dynamically apply the correct rules based on the current date structure during the subtraction process.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases that verify the correct date is calculated when subtracting days across month and year boundaries, including both leap and non-leap years.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user in creating a Prolog program that can accurately compute the date one week ago from a given date, handling transitions between days, months, and years effectively. This will involve recursive logic and careful consideration of month and year boundaries.",

This is because Monday follows six days after Tuesday.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the date of the first Monday based on the known day of the week for January 1. This involves understanding the sequence of days in a week and calculating the offset needed to reach the first Monday. In Prolog, we can use rules to determine the day of the week for any given date and then find the first occurrence of Monday in 2019.\n\n**Plan to Generate a SWI-Prolog Code Prompt:**\n\n1. **Define Date and Day Representation:**\n   - Use structures like `date(MM, DD, YYYY)` for dates and `day_of_week(Day)` for days of the week.\n   - Ensure these structures can interact to determine the relationship between a specific date and a day of the week.\n\n2. **Day Calculation:**\n   - Write a rule to calculate the day of the week for any given date based on a known starting point (e.g., January 1, 2019, is a Tuesday).\n   - This might involve calculating the number of days passed since a known date and using modulo arithmetic to determine the day of the week.\n\n3. **Find First Monday:**\n   - Starting from January 1, 2019, use a recursive rule to find the first Monday.\n   - This involves incrementing the date day by day until reaching Monday.\n\n4. **Leap Year Consideration:**\n   - Although not directly needed for January 2019, it's good practice to include a leap year check for completeness and future use of the code.\n\n5. **Recursive Logic and Search:**\n   - Implement recursive rules to handle the search for the first Monday, using Prolog\u2019s backtracking capabilities to efficiently find the correct date.\n\n6. **Use of Prolog's Search Capabilities:**\n   - Utilize Prolog\u2019s pattern matching and rule application to determine the day of the week for each date as the search progresses.\n\n7. **Test Cases:**\n   - Include test cases to ensure the day calculation is accurate and that the search correctly identifies the first Monday of the year.\n\n8. **Output Format:**\n   - Ensure the output is formatted in MM/DD/YYYY format, making it clear and understandable.\n\nThe code prompt will guide the user to create a Prolog program that can determine the first Monday of any given year based on a known starting point, using day calculations and search techniques effectively."
