% Define the most common words in English based on frequency data
most_common_word('the').  % Assumed based on frequency studies
most_common_word('of').   % Assumed based on frequency studies
% Define a predicate to check if a word contains the letter 'C'
contains_c(Word) :-
atom_chars(Word, Chars),  % Convert word to a list of characters
member('c', Chars).       % Check if 'c' is a member of the list
% Define a predicate to evaluate the importance of 'C' in the most common words
evaluate_c_importance(Word, Result) :-
contains_c(Word),  % Check if the word contains 'C'
Result = true;
\+ contains_c(Word),
Result = false.
% Aggregator to determine the relevance of 'C' in the two most common words
check_c_relevance_in_common_words(Relevance) :-
findall(Word, most_common_word(Word), Words),  % Find all most common words
maplist(evaluate_c_importance, Words, Results),  % Evaluate 'C' importance for each
(member(true, Results) -> Relevance = true; Relevance = false).
