Therefore, Venita is Alan's daughter-in-law.\n\nUsing the transitions provided:\n- **sister-in-laws father is father-in-law**: This transition is not directly applicable here but helps understand the indirect relationships through marriage.\n- **daughter-in-laws father is father-in-law**: This transition confirms that the father of a daughter-in-law is considered a father-in-law, which supports the structure of indirect relationships.\n\n### Plan to Generate a Prompt for Writing a SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Define the relationships in Prolog:**\n   - Identify the individuals involved: Carlos, Venita, Elizabeth, and Alan.\n   - Define the parent and marital relationships between them.\n\n2. **Construct the parent and marital relationships:**\n   - Use facts to represent that Alan is the parent of Carlos and Elizabeth.\n   - Use facts to represent that Carlos is married to Venita.\n\n3. **Define a rule to determine daughter-in-law relationships:**\n   - Create a rule that defines a daughter-in-law relationship based on parent and marital relationships.\n\n4. **Query the relationship:**\n   - Formulate a query to find out how Venita is related to Alan using the daughter-in-law rule.\n\n### Constructing the Plan for the Code Prompt\n\n1. **Define the Facts**:\n   - `parent(alan, carlos).`\n   - `parent(alan, elizabeth).`\n   - `married(carlos, venita).`\n\n2. **Define the Rules**:\n   - A rule to establish marital relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     married(X, Y) :- married(Y, X).\n     ```\n   - A rule to establish daughter-in-law relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     daughter_in_law(X, Y) :- parent(Y, Z), married(Z, X), female(X).\n     ```\n\n3. **Query**:\n   - To find the relationship between Venita and Alan:\n     ```prolog\n     ?- daughter_in_law(venita, alan).\n     ```\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n```prolog\n% Define the facts\nparent(alan, carlos).\nparent(alan, elizabeth).\nmarried(carlos, venita).\n\n% Define the rules\nmarried(X, Y) :- married(Y, X).\ndaughter_in_law(X, Y) :- parent(Y, Z), married(Z, X), female(X).\n\n% Query to determine the relationship\n% To find out how Venita is related to Alan\n?- daughter_in_law(venita, alan).\n```\n\n### Logic\n\n1. **Facts**: Establish who is the parent of whom and who is married to whom.\n2. **Marital Rule**: Ensure the married relationship is bidirectional.\n3. **Daughter-in-Law Rule**: Use the parent and married relationships to define the daughter-in-law relationship.\n4. **Query**: Check if Venita is the daughter-in-law of Alan by traversing the relationships.\n\nThis plan ensures a step-by-step approach to determine the relationship between Venita and Alan using Prolog's inference capabilities and the given Relation Transitions.",

The relationships are as follows:\n- Elliott is excited to cheer on his brother James.\n- Alan loves his brother Elliott, indicating that Alan and Elliott are brothers.\n- Alan loves his daughter Annie.\n\nFrom these relationships, we can deduce that:\n- Elliott and Alan are brothers.\n- Annie is Alan's daughter.\n- Since Elliott and Alan are brothers, James, being Elliott's brother, is also Alan's brother.\n\nTherefore, Annie, being Alan's daughter, is James's niece.\n\n### Analysis\n\nTo analyze the relationship between Annie and James, let's break down the family tree:\n1. Alan and Elliott are brothers.\n2. James is also a brother to Alan and Elliott.\n3. Annie is Alan's daughter.\n\nGiven these relationships:\n- Annie is the niece of James because her father (Alan) and James are brothers.\n\n### Plan to Generate a Prompt for Writing a SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Define the relationships in Prolog:**\n   - Identify the individuals involved: Elliott, James, Alan, and Annie.\n   - Define the parent and sibling relationships between them.\n\n2. **Construct the parent and sibling relationships:**\n   - Use facts to represent that Alan is the father of Annie.\n   - Use facts to represent that Alan, Elliott, and James are siblings.\n\n3. **Define a rule to determine niece/nephew relationships:**\n   - Create a rule that defines a niece or nephew based on sibling and parent relationships.\n\n4. **Query the relationship:**\n   - Formulate a query to find out how Annie is related to James using the niece rule.\n\n### Constructing the Plan for the Code Prompt\n\n1. **Define the Facts**:\n   - `father(alan, annie).`\n   - `brother(alan, elliott).`\n   - `brother(alan, james).`\n   - `brother(elliott, james).`  // Since siblings are reciprocal\n\n2. **Define the Rules**:\n   - A rule to establish sibling relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     sibling(X, Y) :- brother(X, Y).\n     sibling(X, Y) :- brother(Y, X).\n     ```\n   - A rule to establish niece/nephew relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     niece_or_nephew(NieceNephew, UncleAunt) :- father(Father, NieceNephew), sibling(Father, UncleAunt).\n     ```\n\n3. **Query**:\n   - To find the relationship between Annie and James:\n     ```prolog\n     ?- niece_or_nephew(annie, james).\n     ```\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n```prolog\n% Define the facts\nfather(alan, annie).\nbrother(alan, elliott).\nbrother(alan, james).\nbrother(elliott, james).\n\n% Define the rules\nsibling(X, Y) :- brother(X, Y).\nsibling(X, Y) :- brother(Y, X).\n\nniece_or_nephew(NieceNephew, UncleAunt) :- father(Father, NieceNephew), sibling(Father, UncleAunt).\n\n% Query to determine the relationship\n% To find out how Annie is related to James\n?- niece_or_nephew(annie, james).\n```\n\n### Logic\n\n1. **Facts**: Establish who is the father and who are siblings.\n2. **Sibling Rule**: Define siblings as reciprocal relationships.\n3. **Niece/Nephew Rule**: Use the parent and sibling relationships to define the niece or nephew relationship.\n4. **Query**: Check if Annie is the niece of James by traversing the relationships.\n\nThis plan ensures a step-by-step approach to determine the relationship between Annie and James using Prolog's inference capabilities and the given Relation Transitions."

The relationships are as follows:\n- Elliott is excited to cheer on his brother James.\n- Alan loves his brother Elliott, indicating that Alan and Elliott are brothers.\n- Alan loves his daughter Annie.\n\nFrom these relationships, we can deduce that:\n- Elliott and Alan are brothers.\n- Annie is Alan's daughter.\n- Since Elliott and Alan are brothers, James, being Elliott's brother, is also Alan's brother.\n\nTherefore, Annie, being Alan's daughter, is James's niece.\n\n### Analysis\n\nTo analyze the relationship between Annie and James, let's break down the family tree:\n1. Alan and Elliott are brothers.\n2. James is also a brother to Alan and Elliott.\n3. Annie is Alan's daughter.\n\nGiven these relationships:\n- Annie is the niece of James because her father (Alan) and James are brothers.\n\n### Plan to Generate a Prompt for Writing a SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Define the relationships in Prolog:**\n   - Identify the individuals involved: Elliott, James, Alan, and Annie.\n   - Define the parent and sibling relationships between them.\n\n2. **Construct the parent and sibling relationships:**\n   - Use facts to represent that Alan is the father of Annie.\n   - Use facts to represent that Alan, Elliott, and James are siblings.\n\n3. **Define a rule to determine niece/nephew relationships:**\n   - Create a rule that defines a niece or nephew based on sibling and parent relationships.\n\n4. **Query the relationship:**\n   - Formulate a query to find out how Annie is related to James using the niece rule.\n\n### Constructing the Plan for the Code Prompt\n\n1. **Define the Facts**:\n   - `father(alan, annie).`\n   - `brother(alan, elliott).`\n   - `brother(alan, james).`\n   - `brother(elliott, james).`  // Since siblings are reciprocal\n\n2. **Define the Rules**:\n   - A rule to establish sibling relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     sibling(X, Y) :- brother(X, Y).\n     sibling(X, Y) :- brother(Y, X).\n     ```\n   - A rule to establish niece/nephew relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     niece_or_nephew(NieceNephew, UncleAunt) :- father(Father, NieceNephew), sibling(Father, UncleAunt).\n     ```\n\n3. **Query**:\n   - To find the relationship between Annie and James:\n     ```prolog\n     ?- niece_or_nephew(annie, james).\n     ```\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n```prolog\n% Define the facts\nfather(alan, annie).\nbrother(alan, elliott).\nbrother(alan, james).\nbrother(elliott, james).\n\n% Define the rules\nsibling(X, Y) :- brother(X, Y).\nsibling(X, Y) :- brother(Y, X).\n\nniece_or_nephew(NieceNephew, UncleAunt) :- father(Father, NieceNephew), sibling(Father, UncleAunt).\n\n% Query to determine the relationship\n% To find out how Annie is related to James\n?- niece_or_nephew(annie, james).\n```\n\n### Logic\n\n1. **Facts**: Establish who is the father and who are siblings.\n2. **Sibling Rule**: Define siblings as reciprocal relationships.\n3. **Niece/Nephew Rule**: Use the parent and sibling relationships to define the niece or nephew relationship.\n4. **Query**: Check if Annie is the niece of James by traversing the relationships.\n\nThis plan ensures a step-by-step approach to determine the relationship between Annie and James using Prolog's inference capabilities and the given Relation Transitions.",

Jason is the grandfather of Guillermina, which means Jason is one generation above Myrna.\n\nIn other words, Jason is the parent of Myrna, making Myrna the daughter of Jason.\n\n### Plan to Generate a Prompt for Writing a SWI-Prolog Code\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Define the relationships in Prolog:**\n   - Identify the individuals involved: Jason, Guillermina, and Myrna.\n   - Define the parent-child relationships between them.\n\n2. **Construct the parent relationships:**\n   - Use facts to represent that Jason is the parent of Myrna.\n   - Use facts to represent that Myrna is the parent of Guillerina.\n\n3. **Define a rule to determine grandparent relationships:**\n   - Create a rule that defines a grandparent relationship based on parent relationships.\n\n4. **Query the relationship:**\n   - Formulate a query to find out how Myrna is related to Jason using the parent rule.\n\n### Constructing the Plan for the Code Prompt\n\n1. **Define the Facts**:\n   - `father(jason, myrna).`\n   - `mother(myrna, guillermina).`\n\n2. **Define the Rules**:\n   - A rule to establish parent relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y); mother(X, Y).\n     ```\n   - A rule to establish grandparent relationship:\n     ```prolog\n     grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).\n     ```\n\n3. **Query**:\n   - To find the relationship between Myrna and Jason:\n     ```prolog\n     ?- father(jason, myrna).\n     ```\n\n### SWI-Prolog Code Prompt\n\n```prolog\n% Define the facts\nfather(jason, myrna).\nmother(myrna, guillermina).\n\n% Define the rules\nparent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y); mother(X, Y).\ngrandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).\n\n% Query to determine the relationship\n% To find out how Myrna is related to Jason\n?- father(jason, myrna).\n```\n\n### Logic\n\n1. **Facts**: Establish who is the parent of whom.\n2. **Parent Rule**: Use the logical disjunction to define parent relationships.\n3. **Grandparent Rule**: Use the chain of parent relationships to define the grandparent relationship.\n4. **Query**: Check if Jason is the father of Myrna by traversing the relationships. \n\nThis plan ensures a step-by-step approach to determine the relationship between Myrna and Jason using Prolog's inference capabilities and the given Relation Transitions.",
